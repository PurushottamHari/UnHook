I am curious about it why are you alone Do you travel? What's the thrill there? Brother It's not like I'm alone I roam around. Mostly I travel alone There are. The reason is that versatility It is more. I like it more somewhere If I have to spend time then I will do it. No If I have to spend it then I will leave on that very day. So There is more flexibility in this. Any and when I am with you then you have planned things more There is curry. The next guy probably doesn't feel like it is there to get out of there immediately or to the next guy I want to spend many days there Because their plans clash. then fun I don't know. so i'm alone most of the time I roam around. And mine would be very spontaneous There are trips. I mean I don't have a flight ticket Would get it done. right now maybe if I'm here I I was thinking what I knew yesterday and the day before Should I go for a few days free or get some training somewhere? To do. and if I have to go somewhere All the visas are already sorted. Mostly visas remain like that. means india I am coming. I will get them all installed. Butt now Like Shengan I got five years old. The US one was 10 years old, it expires separately Used to be. Australia is as old as 3 years old 6 months from all of New Zealand etc to the UK mine are expiring in August Are. But then go to UK before August It will have to be done. But wherever I feel like it I go there. one side ticket Am. I land there. place for me If I like it then I will stay longer. No If I come, I will leave quickly. and when to leave is this the day before I left or the same day I will decide. so obviously with you If I am some other guy then you will be so Cannot maintain flexibility. right i This is the main reason. and i'm sure i'm alone A very novel type of travel You also get the experience which you get in the group I may not be able to find it. this is my personal I have experience. even if i am two people So, we form a group. then that group Whoever wants to join, he should join that group Is part of. But that group has its identity. Definitely brother, right? You're somewhere alone Get in there too. yes yes yes you are someone's You can be with anyone. Yes, yes. Now A friend of mine is coming. her latex mouth Don't do Thai. I have to but I I will go there, it will never be the same again Adjust. I will think that he is alone at home he is alone in the hotel, if he comes with me He won't feel like doing the same thing to you well I have articulated this is what it means everywhere you You can enter any group yourself If you are interested you can go there You can become a part but you have a common ground Finding someone else is obviously the same If I am traveling with you then already There are a lot of common grounds between you two There will be but there would be some exclusive ones which may not be his, they are yours, me and I I am sure you must be passionate about travelling, like this You must be enjoying it, otherwise the man will get bored It starts happening friend, after some time it is hey brother anything if you are naturally no you don't enjoy anything You can't do that much right You can't do it by force, no matter how much money you have Are you meeting me, whatever is happening, five to six years It's done brother, it's fun traveling so much that's why I am doing it hmm yes I can I can imagine I mean my Two or four years ago it seemed that now It is becoming the same thing. means now if I called my whole trip a very good one I am not giving any character, not that in this we will do it and then this happens till then it is not fun coming. Otherwise, in the beginning, I was also like this Rotate. Yes. Yes yes yes yes. my first The solo trip was such that I told my family about it He said that then I would have been a CA student. I I was doing articleship somewhere. Yes. I've made it home I told them that the office people are sending it somewhere. Told the office people there is a wedding at home somewhere. O brother you made them both run away by telling a lie In the mountains. And where is Kasual? This is a childhood story, brother. very childish This is it. I went like this for the first time. I have also been to Kasol, brother. I last time I came to India. when i come to india So generally what you do is that you tell your brothers I am very close to my brothers and friends Am. Means whoever is my best in Hisar I have friends. I mean my 810 which is closest to me Most of the people are from Hisar. There is a new sprout among them, though I used to travel with him from Bahadurgarh Am. So, he is a travel friend. But who The actual one who is my friend is my brother 810 They are my cousins, in a way, all the same Someone's grandfather from hometown. My grandmother's cousin. We all are in such an extended family There are eight people who are very close, so whenever I When I come to India we generally take a drip Let's plan within India When I am outside India, I tell my family I will call you somewhere in Europe, I am meeting you are you meeting mom and dad somewhere like this I take it or if I come to India then I will take it with them I live with my friends and brothers I go out for a trip, so we went last year where did we go in 24 we went to Goa 23 I went to Hemsol brother what happened there no she doesn't come hash browns don't come in us It does not do whatever it is or comes by force don't know you saying so I tried there But brother he was good so he fed me He said this is a brownie, it has something in it Whatever you bring, it's such a small brownie, what can I do with it I ate a little and ate it Nothing happened brother, I found out after an hour no what happened absolutely feminine My energy got awakened, I was lying down in such a strange manner I am doing weird things like this I am doing it. he is saying he is saying what are you doing I don't know what it is My brother, the dog was outside the room I'm afraid I don't, no Dog, I will go here for how many days I am not scared of dogs now If I say too much then the clips will be cut he beats the dogs he does No brother, he doesn't beat me, but I am not scared Brother there I jump out of the room o My God, this will eat me up. I will do this Brother, he told me that later They showed me the videos and I felt so embarrassed brother the woman inside the fan is really brother i My friend has become a woman. Hey friend, don't feed cannabis to these boys. Brother, it is just cannabis. Whatever it is bro No, yes I only have cannabis. the cannabis itself because I once in my childhood I saw someone eating, I was in the seventh grade I was in the eighth grade and I was terrified inside because I don't know cannabis what happens friend. It was the time of Holi. Someone gave someone a cold drink, he gave them a cold drink In a little while. By doing this I am saying Yes, these people go crazy. Cannabis on the I must be feeling like this, I am sure. we we That means dogs are very paranoid, I don't know When the thigh pain is gone, that feeling is absolutely good It was not there brother so I folded my hands and said this brother I don't want to do things today but brother, overall it is like this It must be a lot because I have taken maybe 15 trips There must be eight in the one I took alone It has happened many times that we will not die This might be more common with you friend that you too die Then you won't go as if you are stuck somewhere Where I had never imagined that math is No, we have reached somewhere beyond our mathematics. something else happened to someone else somewhere I have reached here brother, such situations happen to me who thinks that I mean I know Where is it and till what limit can I go As far as I am able to stay safe, I will Sounds like a bit of my experience It's too much to come out of these situations Lately I was in Congo, DRC is a country The Democratic Republic of Congo is there The first time I felt it as much as it was there I have never experienced that much in any travel till now. I did not think that if I die then what will happen there, brother I happened to be in the eastern part of it. some areas to the east were Boka Goma some Cities was its neighbor in Eastern DRC The country is Rwanda. Rwanda has one million shares in Abel There is a group named M23 of some movement They call it M23, so M23 has Eastern When did I start going to DRC during which I was there just three months ago The thing is, just before coming to India, his Rebel groups are roaming the streets of Hoshia From big AK-47s on trucks to much more It was so intimidating that it felt like Now something will happen now something will happen but I am in no mood to like goma yes that is Rwanda M23 rebels I want to put Goma Airport on this Goma Airport bhaiya is the worst in my life If there was any experience at the airport then this There was an airport 3 months ago on this Goma Airport do that M23 write M23 in front The rebels had just captured the airport Recently the plane must have been shot down O brother brother brother brother brother brother this day when I I left the airport 40 hours later A matter of. Oh brother brother he has taken over If the airport had been captured then M23 rebels wanted We were thinking of taking over the airport So that we can control who is coming and who is coming going so that people cannot leave from here Diplomats and bureaucrats could not go and We will capture the area by force, then this is our desire They were trying to capture the airport and me I had to get out of this situation because The fighting had started almost late February It is about January, late January of 202 She might be from around here, brother I am at the airport I was at the airport and I entered the gate But brother tell me that such an environment may be of any kind can be done at any time and place Militiamen are roaming around with guns. Their DRC's army and police have all arrived, now there is war It will break out. I went to the airport, the airport The DRC military was outside. to me He said, "Brother, you are an undercover agent." your Take out the guns. I got scared brother. mother brother What gun do I have? and told us Looking at you I can tell you are an agent Is. Take out your guns. I said you died Brother, this is all the money I had in my pocket I took it out and mother take it. Said money I don't want the guns out. this is it somehow I made them. Now let's say there French. I don't know French. Big With some difficulty I talked to him, gave him the money and went inside. Now this is such a fragile airport. This airport It can be captured at any time. This airport There wasn't any gun scanning machine. Meaning there was no machine to scan the bags. There was a corner straight ahead. Went to that corner. Speak Go there and get your bag checked. so I I took the bag there. two three there Airport officers sat. He said that it is yours Take out whatever magazines are there in the bag. And In such situation I am thinking brother what will you do it with me even if you push me If you put it in then who is letting me go like this In the atmosphere I said that I have some No, I told you no, do you have a magazine? Come on, we got some news, I have nothing no he saw the bag book my bag The pack was small but they didn't get anything He said come on give me the money now So friend, they are asking for money hey Friend, he only wanted money, Himanshu should give it to him Friend, give me money, you are harassing my brother friend I gave them money whatever little remains Then brother now I am feeling scared that my I did not have the magazine with me, whoever has it I will leave him as well, taking the money She is my more torn brother second level The problem brother is how much money would have been given, anything No, total ₹200 ₹300 for India Just hey, outside came the Blinkit guy, he gave it to me for ₹700 Brother, bring me some coconut water for ₹200 The magazine is missing yes that's it brother What is there no discount in ₹1000, nothing is money So you were not even taking it, meaning name vs. Then brother, show them that there is no problem with this If you had guns you would have paid more Now I feel that if they had taken it they would have taken it from me I will leave anyone like this completely It can be hijacked at the airport any time Airport and brother they don't even have machines Have to scan the boarding pass When I went there they did not have any machine either. I am writing my name in the register, there was a flight I had an airline in Kenya called Air Jbo Probably only they and Ethiopian Airlines operate two registers the name from that airport I am writing your name like this, this is the meaning There is no computer. There was no computer and He gave it straight to me with his hand. this is yours Have a boarding pass. What are you saying? There was no computer. written boarding pass Written by hand. you go back in time They went. It has happened to me twice. one more time It has happened in any country also. this is from africa It will be a country. No, that was Tuvalu. Pacific It's country. One of the least visited countries. The island is Welland. Photo of Island Tuvalu show. We have to increase tourism. but bro I have a question. this africa is genuine Is he so poor? or does it mean something Have they not modernized it? Brother He is poor. Although they receive funding But all the corrupt leaders take them away. Well that means it is a problem of corruption. There is a problem of corruption. they get the money Are. Funding is received. The UN gives in People want to come into the government. Any The government came, they know that we will stay for five years I will not stay. I have to stay for five to six months. His It will happen later. We will move away. So five six Earn as much as you can in a month. Good Is. Five to six months then well. Yes, yes. and well The military does it. The military does it. People We do it too. There is no trust in anything. Generaly The military does it. It is unstable. Very More. I mean not the whole of Africa 54 There are countries. Out of 54 I would say half These are the countries where you can visit. There is a lot of instability in the remaining half. And There is something like this too that Eastern is a Francophile. means he speaks French and The Western Frisian speaks French. Speaks Eastern English. Yes. so this Is there more problem in the East or the West? There is a problem with excess waste and DRC Speak French. The DRC is huge. It is a bit in the East and a bit in the West is also there. It is in the centre. It is also in the centre. There are more problems in the West. Because which I think I'd assume French Yes, the rule that was there was quite aggressive. They He was quite rude. So any French speaker They are Africans, especially West Africans. He is quite rude. You will talk to them. Enough You trade aggressively. Eastern Walking down the street like some Americans. hey how dey bein? Hey, how are you? How are you doing? It remains like this, don't we? I don't need to cut it off. No no that's correct.

Yes. but you You can go to Australia or Fiji yes. There are only two flights from Tuvalu to Fiji. Will you come to Australia from Fiji? just one There is a Fiji flight which runs from Fiji country And when we boarded that flight, we refueled it There is no facility in Talu so they They took off our bags too, so we were without bags Me and Navankuri were my best friends We reached Talu without bags We have four days to spend, we have nothing There is no stock, there are two-three clothes shops Every person gets the same clothes he wears it, it's a chinese store and what is the time Let's pass here Netflix comes here Brother, there is nothing, there are two hotels and that too is meaningless Electricity is generated from non-operational power Brother, Australia provides electricity here. They get all the electricity, groceries and hospitals all the facilities are small and big Australia sends them and the liquor flows Here is the wine and potatoes, it's own liquor The man takes out the drink at his home Look, brother, he finds intoxication no matter how much If a person is staying away, he finds intoxication There is a very important point, alcohol is there brother His is the first man I met in that country He was also drunk, his name was Aatu I got drunk when I was at the Bank of Tuvalu I am looking to rent a scooter So the scooter renter asked for his license give it to me or give me some ID, that's it The tourist who came was fat and said he had two potatoes The tourist came and he is hugging me hey aatu she wore flowers here on the forehead and said no no no I don't want any ID or anything from him, he's my brother Where did it come from? I said it's from India My brother has come from India and he told me to go away Go and take that scooter, I'll come back so lonely I must have been so lonely but bro this is this It happens like when you are in any isolated place I go there and see a man from outside, they are very happy I feel happy brother only then I have fun It is easy to go to such countries. Who It is a tourist spot there so I will record as well He doesn't do it because they are used to tourists of. ok and you know this question gets I asked you, this is a very remote part Is. Have you been to this side of Europe, America or You have also been to Latin America. Where was racism is it with you? No brother, if it happens then it will be on your face Nobody said anything. Wouldn't even dare seeing. I am not I am being very Real. It has never happened to me either. because i Mean a little in Israel. But look at my size. Like you don't be rude to me will you do it. yes yes it does make a difference yes yes yes yes exactly i think maybe Personality might play a little role Maybe they don't, meaning they do it with me in Israel I was stopped on the road and checked two-three times he looked like an Arab so yes brother if I If I go to any Arabic country I can also look Jewish, I mean our Features from Middle Eastern to here You live a very common life brother, no matter where you are from You might think so, in that case it is to me I stopped you two-three times and I am telling you literally Literally this would have happened had he stopped me The Israeli policemen used to open it for me They used to look at the passport, Indian O Kasol Kasol Oh he knew that all the Israelis go to Kasol Isn't it brother, he used to say full charas charas like this Brother, I told you okay, that means we are friends. Till now you were thinking wrong about me but that's the route it would take them first It seemed that if he had done a profile then he It is not technically racism, but their There is police, yes, this happened to me two-three times Well it happened two or three times on the roads but this I mean this happened to me in Syria In Syria, meaning when I went there in 2022 At that time this was Bashar al-Assad who was their He was the president, just now he was brought down by the second The party's government will be formed at that time So during Bashar al-Assad's time, every In 100 and 200 meters, there used to be 100 in military not 200 then 1 kilometer 2 kilometer The military vehicle was stopped by someone Where did the tourists come from if Americans If they were there, they would have searched a lot, good Indian Shahrukh Khan Shahrukh Khan Let It Go Let it go means Shahrukh Khan is not from the country Aaya right so that is a thing in the whole of Africa I am also there because I know a lot about them To myself.

So I think it was a song or some old one This is the song which is made from the movie Russian Circus Pay. So, they know it. that is why that Connection Exists. But I didn't do that before What I used to think when I was little I did not appreciate this. These Shahrukh Khan etc whatever I have said about the actor Is? I never watch movies etc Because I used to think what an actor he is. Ok. So why do people go crazy Behind them. I never understood their hype I did not come.

How far is Fiji from the rest of the world? There is a lot of sea and nothing is far away And Naandi, an island in Fiji, which I I showed her the island, pronounced naandi Let's spell it Naandi, isn't it an island? I and my My new friend was with me. we travel together Were doing it in the Pacific. so I go to the gym seemed to. Navankur doesn't go to the gym. So Navankur said, friend, I am feeling hungry.

He said let's eat roti at this dhaba Are. I said, okay, you eat it. My has to do exercise. I will not eat More. I went and sat down and then a voice came from behind I have come Paramveer sir I thought here too my There are subscribers in Fiji because there are many Sir keeps telling me often that I feel someone I looked back and saw that he must be a subscriber Mera Chef was Delhi University in 2018 I was the chef at that cafe That day, on that island in Fiji, my brother I realized how small the world is, friend, wherever You can find people anywhere, friend I have become crazy fond of Latin America I like it very much brother I think it is very under He talks very little but the more I I have been there, it is not very accessible to me No, it is very far from India and Definitely one of the most underrated Among the places are Latin, Argentina, etc. I didn't go to Argentina brother, I was in Mexico When it was Cancun, not Mexico City Argentina won the World Cup immediately I got my V flight booked to me I didn't have a visa, I found out I need one I applied for Argentina $200 Pay immediately but he wins his World Cup All the office workers had holidays, couldn't go If possible, the visa will come, not after 15 days in South I have only been to America, Colombia I will go to Colombia on this trip now Colombia Top Where did you go Bogota and Mejin Inn There were only two places I went to and that was Karth Hena Kartana Hey Kartana we're at the Festival Did the time pass by just like that brother it is just a city The whole festival is yes I am the best way to I have to describe it because its The town part looks like this Brother it could have been Mathura, you are thinking of him It has that old town vibe but the place is there It is clean and the people there are also such that Sitting on the road playing Ludo with the kids Everybody is dancing like this. This was my first impression when I saw him that friend this could have been any city that I come from if it was cleaner and people were Not this stressed. Poverty is here It keeps us so stressed that we Can't even enjoy it. Yes, yes. and not one There is a factor, Paramveer bhai, maybe you can relate will you do it. I feel like in a city Beauty has great value and the whole of India Roughly all Indian cities Bombay, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Bangalore Beauty There are starred cities. we keep this much forward to their cities. So much rubbish, lack of Planning, two tons, the stench of the drain, the whole of Bombay It smells like drain. abuses to me You will have to work for this. But I will not lie I am speaking. It has a psychological impact Unless you're the beauty in the city You will give people the understanding of God and divinity It will not come, friend, she will not feel it at all. What do you give to people in the city? I I consider electricity as water. I understand roads. very good thing. you guys are traumatized You give it. So much on every road, every red light Poor man and so poor old helpless man Brother, I cried privately one and a half times Am. just standing at the red lights Even if I had cash in my pocket, how much would I give Would give. hmm hmm hmm withdraw ₹800 ₹900 ₹900 by taking it out because brother that uncle is poor They are playing like this. this is us so its na There is impact. You take any ordinary city in Europe In any ordinary city. Have you seen that They are beautiful, friend. We her you morning man He gets up and says. We have it here stress due to awkwardness, that noise is absolutely Brother. We will achieve something. we make money I will take it. We are very capable people in that regard Are. But what makes us feel happy from inside Will you find it in your cities? When we came to Bombay Let's talk about spirit, a big argument I was just meeting people in Bombay. of Bombay Spirit Local. 100 and a quarter people travel in trains They fall under it and die. You Trauma and tragedy have also been romanticised yes friend. Absolutely brother, absolutely. Why do we run to the mountains? Because There is beauty there. we go to the beach When you are from India, go to Konkan or In some area. Yes. There is beauty there. Then the man says, friend, I wish I could keep roaming Just like you do all your life. Because the man If you look for that beauty, it may not be in any sense I can't find it brother. I think so too friend Here people mean nothing, no matter how rich someone is Yes, how expensive is the car? you have to drive that same It's on the road that everyone else is driving on. That broken one will take you any car too Will go. Anyone can do anything by overtaking. And So what does a rich man do here? Rich The man creates his own island. His He builds big walls in front. Four The security guy deploys it. inside her Four Range Rovers and four big vehicles parked Does. Mercedes and so on and says I will live in this. the grass inside it It will be better than the grass outside. Water again rich A man is making an island inside India Because I don't want to step outside I want it. yes yes friend i am not sure it is The Right Way to Play This. this is mine this is mine It has a personal feel. no no bro i agree Am. The value of beauty, you are here Chonqing etc. in China? No, Beijing and Shengha bus. He is there, isn't he? He is standing above. Still it looks below, it looks like this above many Floors. The spelling of Chamkin is different from yours I can't hope so. which is yours Spelling is his problem. you leave it and retire Go away, don't be shocked. from the building The metro goes. when paramveer bhai came out When you go then his shocking Google will be complete. Brother, yes that is what I am saying. The China also, at some level, yes, it is right, it is right, it is right yes it is right china also has beauty at some level Look, open this photo in which there are lights It is burning, yes this is their hill town This could have been their Mussoorie, ah ha ha brother Neither did we give it any shape nor did he give it any shape, friend It looks like a modern marvel Big city that is in the top seven eight cities of the US since this is a bigger city than that I think our urban planning and There is something missing in all of this in our country. It is the first time I went to Mumbai Everyone wants to see Shahrukh Khan's house. to me I have no hobby but somehow I went along with it With the ones. shahrukh in bandra west Saw Khan's house. Outside that, brother, is the sea Is. No offense brother but that is what I meant I did not see a bad place. such a bad sea I did not see it brother. There was so much bad smell. There itself Those corn cobs are sizzling. I kept the paan spit there people have. and with the sea breeze It all comes into the nose. now his house is inside I don't know how luxurious it will be. several 100 It is worth crores. But that area friend then I I also have a group chat. I my brothers Sent to. There friend this house is worth 200 crores He has taken it here. in Croatia if this This sea pass costs one and a half to two crore rupees Such a blue sea, such a bigger sea than this His. No, you have to make a point here. You will have to show it visually, Paramveer Bhai. The one from Croatia who is Blue of Croatia I have seen very few things bluer than that In life. Yes. Whether it's his Plitvice There is a park. Which one is that, it is a national park. Don't know. Good. nice croatia brother The beauty of Croatia is unmatched beauty In this case split or dubro split yes yes what is this in Dubron There shouldn't be any villa on the shore, it is so big that it is one and a half A villa like this will cost Rs 2 crores, even closer to his house Double big and such a sea, such a wind, such a peace But how much have you overdone it my friend? Now in India, the people who go to Mumbai They are seeing the sea in their mind The definition of the sea is the same as that of Shahrukh Khan looked outside the house at North There would be no sea, no one like us would go If I hadn't seen Croatia. If If I had not gone out of India, my So the definition of the ocean remains the same throughout life. Is. It smells like that. There is black water. There is spittle fallen there. these beauty If you haven't seen it then their standards should be the same Wow, let's go to Marine Drive. wow sea Sit on the side. So I think a lot These things do not need much development The cleanliness and standards are very good. It is useless for me. I think I should ask for this It's not a big deal to ask for You can increase the hygiene and beauty quotient Improve India. Brother tell me something about Thailand The entire economy is tourism. Eight more such countries can you tell me about Indonesia etc. The majority economy is tourism. we are those countries What is there in it which is not in our country Is. I'm talking realistic How much have you experienced from tourism point of view I have travelled to India. Didn't travel much. More Did not turn around. I have travelled a lot in India. We You want to see mountains more beautiful than this except maybe in contests like Patagonia There are no mountains in Argentina. From this As beautiful as our beautiful mountains. whether Be it this side or the east side. If You go to North East and search for the mountains there. Zero Valley Zero Valley is probably in Arunachal If you search for the mountains and lithams there A I T L U M I'm telling people I couldn't believe my eyes How beautiful can it be to visit Meghalaya for the first time is there anything good brother hey this is zero on the left I open that image, open the left zero Look at this green valley, this green whole world except maybe the Alps in Switzerland etc This green will not be seen anywhere except etc. Bhai Bhai I 10 Days in the French Alps I spent last year here. Yes. exactly like that in the village. What was the name of that village? I am so I even forgot the name of that village. the village was Properly. Yes. I will tell you about such villages now. I give you whatever is clean in Himachal Because it is very difficult to carry dirt up to the mountains. It becomes useful. Yes. But brother, we have There is infrastructure for that tourism. Good They became mountains. If you talk about beaches. I understand the problem of Bengal sorry This is the problem of the Bengali Arabian Sea that it is a sea with a lot of mud so its The water always looks brown. This side also that Side too, that is not our mess's fault. But if you go to the Bay of Bengal side you will find many You will find many good ones. you island side Go, you will get some great pictures Will go. If you consider the Kerala coast Do consider its back water top. Houseboat season tops. Top brother. Ok? And You will find religious tourism all across India You have to do any type of tourism. You will get it. The industry is not developed Brother. It is not safe for people to come. To you You have to choose late or go to Meghalaya again Or Switzerland and all your Logistics expenses are covered. where are you will you go? right now you will get Meghalaya right now Because it takes a little time to go to Switzerland 8 It will take an hour. But I will tell you this No, it is that kind of thing brother. If you are a health food Make it. Any healthy one, you tell me brother Prakhar I have healthy food for you and it is tasty No. I will not accept it. so to the man The feeling of luxury comes only when that money He pays extra and sits for 8 hours. Then He feels that friend has done something. that indian Man cannot accept this. Faridabad Puri This is the intention of the city, no matter how good you are Open a shop, we will not spend any money by coming here. Because I will spend it after going to Delhi. suffering then Yes, before spending your body. Yes, yes. These It becomes an attitude. Otherwise Meghalaya my eyes were opened. and Meghalaya There is a freedom overall. so many rule bonds I mean the people there also like me so much You started welcoming me, seat me on your bike I took you around in the jungle all alone put your bag behind me and I have a That speaker seemed to be playing music Roaming around the whole of Meghalaya on bikes is awesome friend so the man says friend if there is so much beauty It is in our country and right now I am going to Meghalaya I am talking about it, I did not go inside it I am on top of that, Manipur, Assam, Arunachal, all these I did not see anything like Tripura etc. I have seen Sikkim, I have seen a little bit of Sikkim In Sikkim I went to the very top of Yumthang Le YM t h u n Yamthan is a valley. Yes. If above Sikkim You go to the North Side as much as I can remember Used to be. Brother, I have my own photo which I Taken from my phone. yes there is no The Indian mountains are unmatched. Yes yes there is no competition. If you get this Look brother, open any photo. Top Open the photo on the left In. Going to the right. Right right. Just keep pressing the right button Not on your keyboard. go right friend first of all this is this valley Prakhar bhai you like India's tourism If you are made a minister, what changes would you make? You will say that there are more tourists in India It's a good question, I think one of them is safety Communicating to the Global Tourist The most important thing now is that you How will you create the environment but I am global We will communicate safety to tourists As Goa is getting filled up now One very clear thing is that the person who earns money He wants to go somewhere by spending money, go to Goa For example I want to go to Gokarna Start tourism there also. His Start talking about it too. Because No, tourists always spread like this. one place From there it develops into four different places Is. Ok? So local tourist will get new I have to tell the place to go because otherwise he He will go to Mussoorie, Dehradun, Goa and raid it. Eventually it will be overused. No handle will be able to do it. We have a large public. Global Start giving the perception of safety to tourists Have to do it. You have to fix law and order Is. You for whatever reason police This needs to be elevated to the priority list of stations. tourist cities Hampi, Pondi which all these Religious cities where you go Police activity in Varanasi etc. There should be more foreign tourism They should be encouraged and they should never feel unsafe because if I have money then tourism If we want to expand, the money will come from outside Good Luxury Tourism as a Brand Increase We should do luxury in Rajasthan We are tourism, we are very top hotels I am saying luxury safari in Ranthambore why aren't we here don't we know Brother, there are no animals in our safaris The chances of being seen are also less. I heard it is more easy in Masamara etc. Can be seen. I am just sharing AT RECENTLY. Yes. So I heard there you have on Demand tells that by evening this animal I will introduce you to him. There is no such animal Which is in your mind but you cannot see it. and that He asks what do you feel like seeing today. Look Is. So brother you are taking luxury tourism as a brand increase because global man invest money wants. As many people as there are in Sri Lanka at this time going. We You saw Sri Lanka. All the Goans Tourist from Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and Global Tourists are also from global Russian yes yes Russian Now all the Europeans are also going to the next Bali Sri Lanka is no different In Sri Lanka the roads are clear, the stones are broken There is no law and order, it's not very good There is no strong law and order and the food is not available Sri Lankan food is worse than ours man man cries yes yes yes meaning Realistically everything in Sri Lanka is perfect I just don't like the food yet. Available Yes Yes Yes Total cities in Sri Lanka How many are there? colombo kalatara kalutara and one two and four city eliya nare eliya whatever there's one that's four cities yes four cities so I I can give you Goa Goa and back and forth yes yes so we have a little image of our own There needs to be a change in the tourism sector. Us People want to sell luxury travel He is a foreign tourist. We need tourism We want to sell safety and we want to expand radially Tourist centres have to do this. hmm hmm Hmm. so if auroville pondicherry is running So what can we do next to Auroville Poncheri We can, we what you said about the police No, in tourist cities there is no police Should be more active. Prioritize Tourists should do this. This is in my opinion It is very important. Let me give you an example like Many of my friends went to Brazil. I am currently Haven't gone yet. But in Brazil, there are quite a few There are more gangs, crimes, and favelas. It is impossible for them to steal your phone yes. Brazil if you stay for a few days. But What happens? Stop it, friend. Sorry brother. yes turn it off. I am feeling cold too. My nose got completely blocked. If your phone is stolen in Brazil. If it is a local's phone that has been stolen then The police will not even go to the favela. if went Went. If it happened to a tourist then it is a favela I will go to. They will say return it. Any You can steal the local one but then we will leave it. Its Return it and they will return it. So They sponsored the tourists To the foreigners. Same thing in Cuba too. One My friend was in Cuba. steal his phone Happened. Went to the police. my phone was stolen Is. He said if it would have been someone else's then maybe we would have been like this Should not have taken action. That guy is in jail right now is in. The person who stole the phone was only two years old That guy is done and in jail. so my thought You will also have to prioritize yourself from Specially for foreign tourists. now here Where do so many policemen listen? So much It's crowded, there's so much population, so many There are cases. do the same things to yourself Will need it. What do you like about Europe? Brother Every country in Europe has similar architecture It will happen. One would be Old Tatown. Enough pretty little. In Europe my brother General Joe I like Germany a lot in parts Maybe it's because I have friends there. But lots of them. Portugal, Greece and Portugal did not go. I haven't been to Greece yet. And Spain went to Spain. Spain Spain then went Am. I think this is the warm side of Europe It would be good. I did not go to all three. I like Italy. Good Italy choice Is. I like Italy. I like Spain too. Germany Although you will not relate to that thing. What is happening in Germany is similar to what is happening in Spain It is happening. I mean, people are a little different. People from a cool place. obviously less Warm. yes there are not that many hospitals As many as these people from the hot Mediterranean countries. Absolutely correct. so this is what i feel about people That's what I have also become to a large extent. Meaning, wherever I am, I become like that. So I don't have any problem. If the next The person is absolutely cold, no problem Is. I will also live my life. Spain I like Italy, I like Italy, recently in Italy I did a road trip. so with the family I was out for quite some time so I was not happy with my family I called him. then we take the car Had travelled around. Italian food Italy is also such a place I mean no one, I haven't found anyone like that It seems as if he liked Italy. in Europe. every European's dream destination with these Europe is Italy or Croatia, okay? Croatia is becoming more popular now Right, I like Italian food so much. I don't like pizza etc unless it has that in it don't put your catch up watch in it Fill it with oregano or not, it is not tasty yes until he comes in 30 minutes and that brother There may not be any cricket match going on friend Dominos End Cricket yaar what a vibe bhaiya childhood bhaiya I did not like that food as a child So this was their pasta vs pizza I didn't enjoy it etc. But besides that, Italy is enough. best pizza chicago in my Opinion Best Pizza Chicago. in Chicago There is a place there, it is from the year 2016. I am a I stood in line for pizza for an hour. Well, she lives with them. Yes, she stays there. Deep They have a dish like this, a thick one It remains deep dish. Chicago I've Had Very Good pizza. New York Largely Overhead Butt If you find a right spot. amazing Pizza. Yes. The modern pizza we eat is American have a pizza. because that's Italian pizza He lives there like a big tomato. They Brother lives a little differently. I like flavours Also seems a bit bland. Exactly American Pizza, that too New York Pizza, is available. That New York pizza slice so thick. They Where is the best place to treat diabetes? Are you looking for it in New York now? my friend There was a place near the college. Good Coonets. Good. which street is it Where? at 110 and Broadway. Good. Connet k o r o n a t his na slice so much It used to be big, about the size of a pizza slice yes when i first ate it My head was blown but I was ready for pizza I am not a big fan of anything, neither am I, brother. hmm i don't like pizza very much it's crazy like people live there But we are not going to eat one such thing for your whole life You can, but the taco should not be Indian tacos hands down i think because they That meat roti is practically Indian Exactly but I mean I had tacos I specifically go and eat when I I go to Mexico right? Yes, the street people I will eat this flavour because I like it I don't know what's the difference between Alastor and this but I eat them all because I The tacos are genuinely delicious on it That little bit of onion salsa with vinegar Let the flavour come, oh brother, it doesn't feel chilli Maximus puts a lot of chilli in the taco, man It is like this in my in-laws house, so we are the ones stay Let it go, it doesn't feel like chilli to me I actually like chillies. good i like it Not there. I have eaten like this on the road many times Didn't go to maximum. I used to say that no pikte no pikte si pikte And those people went to Mexico together with the Indians When I am very happy, I am also very happy It is quite similar friend, this thing interests me the most it seems more fascinating that even two we all Come from a very different ethnic cultural Religious National Background in the World But there are so many common interests, so many similarities Where are the people, where are the Americas Where is Mexico and where is India but still We have so many common interests, I mean cultures, How similar are values ​​and moral ethics Buddy. Brother, I mean, especially with Mexico My family is realising now. I I realised it very quickly. We people Most of the beans are humans. Yes, yes Exactly. Just something like this here The system is different. But how can that not happen? We are a little more evolved. and any difference Not there. But actually this is the situation Because you are like them, from food to their Let's treat God. His Central The Central God Family in Mexico. Central Is And the talk in the country is that you should visit the US yes not much bro i'm from texas ohio New York California I've probably been to one or two more states, I don't remember Good, and have you travelled to Australia etc.?

Now I have to live in a good place. pack the bag first I roamed around in the same pyjama and the same kurta For. Earlier this scene used to happen. I When I reached Pondicherry, I and Pacheri My friend from the cast was polite with me too brother he is a polite and nice guy You will hear from him also, he will say such things Because we have a common history, me and If we are humble childhood friends then we are very we have traveled together it's good my The shoes were stolen and the slippers were broken I will first walk barefoot through Auroville for the whole day nice and polite and i'll give you a scooty Somehow we found it, then it was ours I went out barefooted with my scooter brother Burning feet on leather Meaning travelling alone is now a luxury Traveling, I do all this now a little more Forget about luxury, we don't even learn about discomfort You can obviously not sleep on the footpath Obviously there is someone to take care of you But it's not like I'm just alone I travel only with my boy friends I've pretty much had the same experience as I was in Africa In West Africa I have a Belgian I found this guy, his father's name was French He used to say that he spoke all European languages So she and I spent a lot of time together When I travel it happens many times that I I do it with someone for some period. 20 days a month a week alone from let's Generally I can go on like this with someone for 20 days Is. I recently spoke to Vinamra Was. I haven't read any book till now In my life. Didn't read any book. School If I had not studied, I would have cheated Was. There is no point in reading it later. So I politely asked you, brother are you my I have to start reading. Some? Recommend from books. you sent it to me I have kept a good list. Although I have Haven't bought it yet. Great Person to Ask That. The more the humble the humble reads and Very few people read with as much passion as he does Are. Yes. His brain is next level in that sense So you can take reading recommendations from him. yes. He had sent a good list. Polite and My travel stories are such that Vinamr can ever tell me on camera. I mean I'm telling you this point blank. I tell you that she and I have traveled a lot together In. And those things are such that thank God we People were not on the internet then. and brother means Now I have people around me, wherever I am sitting He told me come on tell me your stories I travelled. Now one of mine they gave me one I have seen image personality on the internet. My has to be maintained. I tell them those things I can't even describe what I've seen If you have talked on the internet then I will talk to you from afar Even if a friend comes to him alone, can not speak like nothing at all Brother, why did you laugh, he was going to say I caught her you were back You know it happened like this As if you had entered his mind through his embrace The thing has been snatched back from him Guys you guys go and write in the comments Himanshu You have lost your job. First of all Himanshu's I lost my job. What did you need to do To laugh? Understand when you need to restrain Restrain. Oh brother, you asked this in the right way In my neck. Yes Brother, here comes the art of conversation brother. This way We are the best podcasters in the country Buddy. You have taken it lightly brother. Brother, first you insulted my laughter. Then his laughter spoiled the work. Himanshu, don't take pressure. I am doing it. I am creating your character on camera. Now if you sit here then it will be yours. AC Turn it on and sit. So brother, those are the stories of my eight brothers. It is limited to them only. so he doesn't go out I could never go away. I understand. This talk I understand brother. I absolutely say this You mean these are things you would never do You can on camera. The real joy of traveling no ok and what is the second thing? Married Man cannot do these things like that. A married man should keep his tongue You may have to rotate it a little bit. How Should I tell you where I was stuck? How can I tell you with what face? how do i meet the eyes of the man i am a man 's morality changes when suhaag Someone's marital bliss becomes its morality Now I am not wearing the ring, but the ring here you can imagine brother now you are back I feel you will go for a walk right now It is like yesterday, this tomorrow is never the way I mean, it's Delhi, my bag is packed, I'm coming I just keep that bag in the cupboard like that The day I am leaving I woke up just like that that travel bag is separate so I took it out When you come back, don't come here after visiting We'll talk again, decompress We will do it, we will talk. is it on camera or Without? No, look at what isn't coming on camera. Well, a lot of things get cut anyway. When you talk openly in India You can talk openly, we should not post openly. Why am I right or not? Exactly brother. live your life freely then We will see it later. Yes. but overall my I think I had a lot of fun. Today So we probably just scratched the surface have done it. We could have talked about so much. Yes It's too much brother. too much. As At first I thought we were talking today you were expecting me to ask that Brother what crazy story do you have then? Slowly I realized this, this is the thing Whatever he does, we will do it, then you should also do the same I did not talk, today I probably would not have spoken I was prepared not to talk to him. I have to keep a very family version of myself but i am sure that is what is expected of you in podcast also that Tell me something, then tell me what happened, crazy? So we had fun, we sat and had fun brother Absolutely and there was more two way conversation It was fun, same thing happened with Humility too People are abusing him in the comments Is. Now let Paramveer bark. why do you say This is happening in the middle but it's not fun Brother. Once upon a time, from our side, our audience Appeal to him that he is a good man. As such Not there. bro it's ok it's not that bad Was. It's over, time has passed brother. 2 hours The man from is sitting here. her phone four times It's already time. He hasn't picked it up. Saying Hey, the work is done. She gave me tea, brother, and So I did not give anything. I gave him water. Later Look at the #shbrownies out there. Ash brownie is kept. The job was not over. No brother I I did not ask for anything. I enjoyed it brother Prakhar just as I thought after talking to He is a fun guy brother, just as I thought initially It is not like that, he laughs, he laughs himself too Brother, this thing made me genuinely laugh I was coming, he is a funny guy brother, I enjoyed it We will meet again after doing a podcast I also started my own podcast channel. I did it, anyway, I'm not going to advertise it. I want to, I haven't put anything in it yet, meaning Back then what I used to do was my course I used to promote the course every There is no latest update on the podcast yet I didn't do anything like that, but I thought I would like to tell you one thing please tell me na, meaning 10 years ago you did you say something while sitting with friends That thing disappeared. don't you remember him and you know the matter between those three people She spoke in front of two people. the internet's best This is the biggest quality and the biggest drawback. One Whatever discussion will happen on this, it will not be deleted It could be possible. somebody has it The downloaded video will remain. Somewhere he will remain. So neither its nor we are not gravity understand how big the platform is and very heavy words or anything that you who thinks you'll ever regret it Obviously our personality changes during the course of our life some things What you believed before, you no longer believe in I agree and that is totally fine but still I feel like it's not a big deal that once the thing is gone it will be delivered you won't take back your words so then I thought friend I Now I will do less podcasts etc. I I want to talk on any topic on my own channel. Have to do it. Any travel destination in my mind A thought came to my mind related to some culture, Whatever you are talking about related to a city, have been. Exactly these are the things if I If I feel like doing it, I will do it alone or I will arrange for a traveler friend to sit. Our I will ask a friend to sit. he went to some country Wherever we go, we talk about that country. Ambulatory because then I will have the freedom to Can I post on that? as you Said. Say anything, do anything, but Keep posting it. You have control over it Needed I would like to give an addition to this Am. I feel quite genuinely about this I do it. I think so, the audience At the end of the day it's 28. I am 29 years old I am of the same. Ok? at the end of the day the Average Age for Successful Content Creators In this country is 27 27. you are 27 years old You can. It might be older than that. They might be smaller. As much as you can understand He is as stupid as you are. Hmm. Now our There is both a blessing and a curse in the hand that if we talk then there are 1 million such men He just listens to it. and this is its disadvantage too that if we do something wrong then it will be 1 The millionaire man listens. now what is wrong Its definition can be your own. My It could be mine. I understand. But If you don't give us freedom it's a mistake To do. We talk for four hours every week I do it. My colleagues work 8 hours a week Let's talk about it. if we don't make a mistake If we could, we would be discouraged. To you I get angry at some time or the other. no one I get angry due to some reason. you society There's x thing going on in me. You're doing that X thing You add to it. An influencer said in 2015 I had said one thing and in his life his Come into his life and give him bamboo in his inbox You start it. Then that demotivated feeling Will he do it or not? And what I mean to say is this It could be the same thing, it could be any leader of yours may have said it, some TV anchor may have said it, Some local student leader might have said this. But he He said it privately. We have There are disproportionate losses. Because we have that Talking in a fun way in some context I had said it. How can you cross that out on Twitter? You can drive it too. And I'm talking. You may believe it or not. you your children Our mine doesn't have anyone else like me will look at the man. You guys can do anything. The Hardware of Content Consumption Has Changed And now we are the new thing. And I this I am not saying it like that. I tell him in this sense That if we are the new thing then Help us do better. And it may not be Always come from scolding us. we have a Dispropionate loss. we are always ourselves Censoring. we are never sure what we will Say and what it will be taken as a letter. donation We never have free conversations. i you I am telling you how many people I sit with Am. Paramveer Bhai, the first half hour here is mine it takes time to lift a stone from a man's chest Is. hum hum hum so that it becomes lighter. They Let's relax. hey i will edit it Friend, don't take tension, speak openly. Because the man was carrying so much heaviness is all about Twitter comments and YouTube Of the comments. You can also like your favorite creator Give yourself a chance to make mistakes. and if there is any He is pointing his finger forcefully. you come to him Tell me in front of me brother what happened? mistake then Was. It happens to even the best of people. that's it So their track isn't red Who is 70 years old. because at that time There was no social media. it's ours and when you can you largely assert that Prakhar's Or is Paramveer's intent your country's own? If it is audience service then it is capable of this much There is no need to be about these things I don't need to be so uncomfortable There's something so punishing about these things oriented and antagonism oriented I don't need you friend, I genuinely do I am telling you I sense it in front of me 50 men sit per month hmm just relax it's ok hum hum it's ok so tense about how the public will respond to that Not a good position I think look at the science and technology is a cutting edge field That is the hard power of the world, that is weaponry Those are aircrafts, those are vehicles.
