Friends, recently Trump made such a statement which created a stir in the whole world and it is being said here that a big war can break out between Israel and Iran.  You can see this news Israel, Iran war looming.   The reason for this is that US Trump has decided that he will withdraw his personal assets from the Middle East.  You might remember that before the election, Trump repeatedly asked why he was spending so much money on the war. Our people are being killed, simply.  Why are we trying to protect here?  So we will withdraw it and taking a step towards that, Trump has announced this. So let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly has been announced and what its impact is going to be.  I will tell you about the overall region contest.  This video is very important. Let's move on.  But before that, let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC, this Pratigya batch for 2026, friends, do avail it because during the Great Learning Festival, you are being given an extra offer here.  All you have to do is use this code AnkitLive so that you can get maximum discount and you will get its link in the comment section.  Let's get started.  Look, US President Donald Trump has just announced that he will move out America's personnel from the Middle East. American assets and air bases in many countries in the Middle East will be withdrawn.  Because look what Trump said?  It could be a dangerous place. Now this can have many meanings which I will discuss with you further.  But at the same time the United States also said that we will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. So now the whole world is afraid whether Iran will also make a nuclear weapon ?  So keeping this in mind, Trump has said here that we will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.  Well here you have to understand a little background about Trump's long standing stance and what is his policy regarding the Middle East?  Look, Donald Trump repeatedly says that America First will be his foreign policy, under which US involvement in foreign conflicts will be reduced. Here his focus will be more on domestic economic and border issues and at the same time he considers US intervention in the Middle East a costly affair.  This means that America increases its unnecessary expenditure, which should not be done.  So in fact, you might remember that during his first term, Donald Trump had given the order to kill Iranian General Qasim Soleimani. Apart from this, the number of troops in Iraq and Syria was reduced. Along with this, an attempt was made to bring the Abraham Accord between Israel and Arab Nations here in a way.  Apart from this, they broke the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which was made jointly by Iran and many other countries.  If the US pulled out, this agreement became meaningless.  So what has happened now is that if you look recently, in the last one year, a lot of developments have taken place in the entire region in the Middle East and you will have to understand this a little bit that because of these developments the instability has increased a lot in the Middle East. For example, if we talk about Iraq, many attacks have taken place in Iraq and who is behind this? Many Iran-backed groups, such as Kata'ib Hezbollah, have launched many rockets etc. on US air bases here.  Apart from this, if we talk about Syria, what has happened inside Syria is that the ISIS grouping has increased here and apart from this, the Turkish and Kurdish classes here are also continuously increasing.  So this is the condition of Syria.  As far as Yemen is concerned, you all already know.  Hose live here.  And these people are basically engaged in continuously attacking the Red Sea shipping lanes. And it is obvious who is supporting them from behind?  Iran is supporting here.  Apart from this, if we talk about Iran, then what is happening in Iran is that at present a nuclear enrichment program is going on, which Israel does not like at all. So Israel has carried out some attacks. You will remember this even inside Iran.  Then as far as the question of Israel and Gaza is concerned, you all already know how much problem has arisen here at present. After the ceasefire break, the tension here has increased further.  Israel has in a way decided that we will completely destroy Hamas.  So, I hope you can understand that tensions have increased a lot in the entire Middle East in the last one year. Instability has increased considerably.  So keeping this in mind, Trump has somewhere decided that the US will withdraw.  Well, Trump has said that the US will withdraw from the Middle East. What does it mean?  Who will withdraw?  The first thing is that the diplomatic staff present in US embassies and consulates like in Baghdad and Erbal will be removed from there.  Will be called back to the US.  Apart from this, many military advisors who assist the Iraqi and Kurdish forces are also being withdrawn from there.  Apart from this, the CIA NSA agents who are engaged in intelligence gathering to know about Iranian proxies are also being removed from there. And it is obvious, just think how much impact it will have, the intelligence gathering that America used to do earlier will not be possible here now. Meaning they will not have the information in advance.  Along with this, there are many private contractors, logistics providers, they are also being told to come back to America.  Well now, what has Trump said about this withdrawal ?  So what reason did Trump give?   The first thing that is said is that personal safety is most important for us. Instability has increased across the region. So there are more chances of attacks here. Because of which the American citizen will be killed.  So because of that we are withdrawing from there.  Apart from this, we no longer have the domestic appetite for reengagement. Basically Trump is saying that we no longer want to engage in any way in the Middle East. Apart from this, strategic realignment may also take place somewhere.  This means that the forces which have manpower may be looking to shift towards Indo-Pacific and Eastern Europe. Basically because of everything that is going on with NATO and Russia access and at the same time they are also giving a political message.  In a way, Trump is signaling both strength and pragmatism.  Well, Trump's statement here needs to be decoded a little.  What did Trump say?  It could be a dangerous place.  That means what he is saying about the Middle East is that it could be a dangerous place and we will see what happens.  So basically this is a classical Trump statement where on one hand he is suggesting that the volatility in the Middle East is going to increase even more in the times to come.  So in a way he is hinting that in future a big war can happen in the Middle East.   On the other hand, somewhere America is shirking its responsibility.  Meaning he is saying that now we do not want to get involved in it. Regional actors should now pay attention to themselves.  Meaning, whatever mess you have created, now you have to take care of it yourself.  We are going from there.  Be it Saudi Arabia or Israel, they will have to take care of themselves. So this is basically the message we are trying to give.  Firstly, they have given a message to Iran that even though we are withdrawing, we are keeping an eye on you. You will not make nuclear weapons.   On the other hand, they are telling their US voters that wars are very costly. We want to protect our troops. And that's why we're calling them back home. And the message to the whole world is that America is no bigger than your policeman.  You have to handle your problem yourself. So in a way the US is retreating a bit here. Well, because of all these things, the entire focus is now on whether a big war is going to happen between Israel and Iran.  Because if you look at the rivalry between Israel and Iran, it has been going on for a long time.  It's been several decades. Iran in a way says that Israel should not exist.  The way Israel was formed, it should not exist as a country. And because of this, many Iran-backed groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad keep attacking Israel here.  On the other hand, Israel says that the way Iran is making nuclear weapons here, it is a threat to its existence.  There is a threat to Israel's existence. Iran will make nuclear weapons by tomorrow's date. Iran can fire that on Israel.  So Israel fears that Iran should not make nuclear weapons at any cost and that is why Israel continuously tries to attack Iran as much as possible through cyber attacks or directly through missile attacks etc. Well, if you look at the recent past, many Iran-backed groups have chosen Israeli and Western targets in Syria, Iraq and Yemen and have attacked there. Then Israel feels that high profile strikes should be continuously carried out on Iranian personnel.   This should be done on the nuclear infrastructure so that it can keep Iran under pressure. And look, Iran's nuclear program is advancing very rapidly.  What I mean to say is that if Iran increases the enrichment of uranium beyond 90% then it will be able to develop nuclear weapons.  What it is right now is being said to be 60-70%.  So, it is quite close.  Because of this, the entire international community keeps a constant watch on this place. What could be a good war scenario?  Most probably it is being said that after US withdraws, Israel will do the same because see what Trump said here?  It could be a dangerous place.  This means that a major war can break out in the Middle East and Israel can launch a major strike on Iranian nuclear sites.  This is a huge possibility.  And if this happens, a big war will break out here and you can understand that Iran will also not lag behind and Iran will also continuously attack here through ballistic missiles etc.  It is possible that they may start attacking many Israeli cities, cities, military bases, US assets and due to this you may see a change in the entire regional balance. Hezbollah and Hamas can also open additional fronts. Rebels from Yemen can attack.  And it is possible that Yemen is basically Saudi Arabia, if you see here, Yemen can basically start attacking Saudi Arabia, UAE on many of their oil bases etc. So, as I told you, a big war can break out.  Anyway, the question here is what could be the geopolitical impact of America's withdrawal from the Middle East ? Look, if we look at it in the short term, what happens here is that US Trump wants that the lives of the US people should be saved.  There are chances of war there. So, because of this, it might be known to the American people also.  So, we are removing him from there.  What's more, there are mid-terms in America next year.   There is an election.  So even before that, Trump wants to project his anti-war image here.  Apart from this, the long term implication here could be that the regional influence of America is definitely going to worsen.  It is going to be weak , it is going to be weak.  And because of this, a huge power vacuum will be created in the Middle East which different players will now try to capture.  For example, if we talk about what can happen next in this entire region?  If we talk about Iran, Iran will become more empathetic due to the US departure and will try to expand its regional hegemony. As far as Israel is concerned, it can definitely be a big setback for Israel that America will not be able to help it the way it used to earlier and obviously Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf states will now have to protect themselves and terror groups like ISIS will get a big encouragement for them and they will try to expand their means, the ISIS groups and it is a big opportunity for Russia and China as well that whatever gap will be created due to US departure, they will take advantage of that opportunity.  In fact, if you look historically, you get to see such things many times.  When America withdrew from Vietnam in 1975.  The war lasted for 20 years.  America had lost. He did not have the courage.  That means the whole world knew about this.  But the American President was in a way telling the people of America. Look what a big victory we have achieved.  This actually did not happen. So the US had withdrawn from Vietnam.  In 2011, Obama withdrew from Iraq and a vacuum was created there and this led to ISIS.  The way ISIS expanded, that was one of the big reasons why Obama withdrew his troops from Iraq.  In 2021, Biden exited Afghanistan. And at that time, you will remember, the Taliban had completely taken over.  So this time too it is being said somewhere that if Trump is withdrawing from here then in a way a big vacuum will be created and we will have to see who tries to capture it now. So this was the whole video friends.  I hope you have understood it well and before leaving, a very interesting question.  Look at the Abraham Accord which was broken by the US. It involves normalization of ties between Israel and which of the following countries?  I have to tell you this.  And you all know the right answer to this.   You will find it on my Instagram.
