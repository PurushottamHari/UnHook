1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,280
Hello Friends.  Friends, recently Trump made such a

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,520
statement which created a

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
stir in the whole world and it is being

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
said here that

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
a big war can break out between Israel and Iran.  You

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,879
can see this news Israel, Iran war looming.   The

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,039
reason for this is that US Trump has

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,280
decided that

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,440
he will withdraw his personal assets from the Middle East.  You might remember that

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,760
before the election, Trump repeatedly asked

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,520
why he was spending so much money on the war.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
Our people are being

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,120
killed, simply.  Why are we

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
trying to protect here?  So we

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,960
will withdraw it and taking a step towards that,

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,640
Trump has announced this.

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,880
So let us understand this in a little detail as to

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,799
what exactly has been announced and

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,400
what its impact is going to be.  I will

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,920

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,360
tell you about the overall region contest.  This video is very important.

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,119
Let's move on.  But before that, let me

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,920
tell you all that those of you who are

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,920
preparing for UPSC,

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,360

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,880
you will get its link in the comment section.  Let's get

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
started.  Look, US President

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,920
Donald Trump has just announced that he

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,240

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
will move out America's personnel from the Middle East.

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,560
American

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
assets and air bases in many countries in the Middle East will be

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,680
withdrawn.  Because look

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,439
what Trump said?  It could be a dangerous place.

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,840
Now this can have many meanings which I will

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,320
discuss with you further.  But at the same time the

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,360
United States also said that we will not allow

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,360
Iran to have a nuclear weapon.

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,280
So now the whole world is afraid

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,040
whether Iran will also make a nuclear weapon

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,759
?  So keeping this in mind, Trump has

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,000
said here that we will not allow Iran to develop

60
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840
a nuclear weapon.  Well here you

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,920
have to understand a little background about

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,319
Trump's long standing stance and

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,560
what is his policy regarding the Middle East?  Look,

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,040
Donald Trump repeatedly says that

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,360
America First will be his foreign policy,

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
under which US involvement

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
in foreign conflicts will be reduced.

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,280
Here

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,840
his focus will be more on domestic economic and border issues

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
and at the same time

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,879
he considers US intervention in the Middle East a

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,200
costly affair.  This means that

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,280
America increases its unnecessary expenditure, which should

74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,280
not be done.  So in fact, you might remember

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,480

76
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,959
that during his first term, Donald Trump had given the order to

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,280
kill Iranian General Qasim Soleimani.

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,360
Apart from this, the

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
number of troops in Iraq and Syria was reduced.

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,640
Along with this, an attempt was made to bring the Abraham Accord

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,879
between Israel and Arab Nations here in

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,519
a way.  Apart from this,

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,239

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,560

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,800

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,159
they broke the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which was made jointly by Iran and many other countries.  If the US

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
pulled out, this

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,080
agreement became meaningless.  So

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,480
what has happened now is that if you

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
look recently, in the last one year,

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,800
a lot of developments have taken place in the entire region in the Middle East

92
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,200
and you will have to understand this a little bit

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
that because of these developments the

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
instability has increased a lot in the Middle East.

95
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,680
For example, if we

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,239
talk about Iraq, many attacks have taken place in Iraq

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,959
and who is behind this?

98
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,200
Many Iran-backed groups, such as Kata'ib

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,840
Hezbollah, have

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,000
launched many rockets etc. on US

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,840
air bases here.  Apart from this, if we

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,319
talk about Syria,

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,799
what has happened inside Syria is that the ISIS grouping has

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,200
increased here and apart from this, the

105
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,040
Turkish and Kurdish classes here are also

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,080
continuously increasing.  So this

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,400
is the condition of Syria.  As far as Yemen is concerned, you all already

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,280
know.  Hose live here.  And

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,920
these people are basically

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,760
engaged in continuously attacking the Red Sea shipping lanes.

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,680
And it is obvious

112
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,519
who is supporting them from behind?  Iran

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,920
is supporting here.  Apart from this, if we

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,000
talk about Iran, then what is happening in Iran is that

115
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,919
at present a nuclear enrichment program is going on,

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,600
which Israel does not like at all.

117
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,519
So Israel has carried out some attacks.

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
You will remember this even inside Iran.  Then

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,520
as far as the question of Israel and Gaza is concerned,

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,120
you all already know

121
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
how much problem has arisen here at present.

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
After the ceasefire break, the

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,840
tension here has increased further.  Israel has in a

124
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,080
way decided that we will

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,080
completely destroy Hamas.  So, I hope you can

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,800
understand that tensions have increased

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,199
a lot in the entire Middle East in the last one year.

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,600
Instability has

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,919
increased considerably.  So keeping this in mind,

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
Trump has somewhere decided that the US

131
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,479
will withdraw.  Well, Trump has said

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,720
that the US will withdraw from the Middle East.

133
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,960
What does it mean?  Who will withdraw?  The

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,440
first thing is that the diplomatic staff present in US embassies and

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,919
consulates like in Baghdad and Erbal will be

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,080

137
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,080
removed from there.  Will be called back to the US.  Apart from

138
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,240
this, many

139
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,880
military advisors who assist the

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
Iraqi and Kurdish forces are also being

141
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,880
withdrawn from there.  Apart from this, the

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,880
CIA NSA agents who are

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,880
engaged in intelligence gathering to

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,039
know about Iranian proxies are

145
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,639
also being removed from there.

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,120
And it is obvious, just think how much

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,520
impact it will have, the intelligence gathering that

148
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
America used to do earlier will not be possible here now.

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Meaning they will not have the information in

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,039
advance.  Along with this, there are many

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,039
private contractors, logistics

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,919
providers, they are also being told to come

153
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,560
back to America.  Well now,

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,720
what has Trump said about this withdrawal

155
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,880
?  So what reason did Trump give?   The

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
first thing that is said is that personal

157
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,960
safety is most important for us.

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,960
Instability has increased across the region.

159
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,120
So there are more chances of attacks here.

160
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,759
Because of which the American

161
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,919
citizen will be killed.  So because of that we are

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
withdrawing from there.  Apart from this,

163
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,520

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
we no longer have the domestic appetite for reengagement.

165
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,000
Basically Trump is saying that we

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,240
no longer want to engage in any way in the Middle East.

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,160
Apart from this,

168
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
strategic realignment may also take place somewhere.  This

169
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,960
means that the forces which have

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,800
manpower may be looking to shift towards Indo-Pacific and Eastern Europe.

171
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,880
Basically

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,199

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,120
because of everything that is going on with NATO and Russia access and at the same time they are

174
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,800
also giving a political message.  In a

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
way, Trump is signaling both strength and

176
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,039
pragmatism.  Well,

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Trump's statement here

178
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,600
needs to be decoded a little.  What did Trump

179
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,440
say?  It could be a dangerous place.  That means what

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,560
he is saying about the Middle East is that it

181
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,199
could be a dangerous place and we will see what

182
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
happens.  So basically this is a classical

183
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
Trump statement where on one hand he is

184
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,759
suggesting that the

185
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,919
volatility in the Middle East is going to increase even more

186
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,319
in the times to come.  So in a way

187
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,400
he is hinting that in future a

188
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,160
big war can happen in the Middle East.   On the

189
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
other hand, somewhere

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,919
America is

191
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,599
shirking its responsibility.  Meaning he is

192
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,680
saying that now we do not want to get involved in it.

193
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,840
Regional actors should

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
now pay attention to themselves.  Meaning, whatever mess you have

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,240
created, now you have to take care of it yourself.  We are

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,960
going from there.  Be it Saudi Arabia or

197
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,440
Israel, they will have to take care of themselves.

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,120
So this is basically the message we are

199
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
trying to give.  Firstly, they have given a message to Iran

200
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
that even though we are withdrawing,

201
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
we are keeping an eye on you.

202
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,599
You will not make nuclear weapons.   On the

203
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,319
other hand, they are telling their US voters

204
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
that wars are very costly.

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,560
We want to protect our troops.

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,400
And that's why we're calling them back home.

207
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,440
And the message to the whole world is

208
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,759
that America is no bigger than your policeman.  You have to

209
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
handle your problem yourself.

210
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,240
So in a way the US is retreating a bit here.

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,880
Well, because of all these

212
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,440
things, the entire focus is now on

213
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,599
whether

214
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,720
a big war is going to happen between Israel and Iran.  Because if

215
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,440
you look at the rivalry between Israel and Iran, it has been

216
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,599
going on for a long time.  It's been several decades.

217
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,599
Iran in a way says that Israel

218
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,160
should not exist.  The

219
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,319
way Israel was formed, it should not exist as a country.

220
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
And because of this,

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,879
many Iran-backed groups like Hezbollah,

222
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,560
Hamas, Islamic Jihad

223
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,840
keep attacking Israel here.  On the other hand,

224
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,840
Israel says that the way Iran is

225
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
making nuclear weapons here, it is a

226
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,520
threat to its existence.  There is a

227
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,599
threat to Israel's existence.

228
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,599
Iran will make nuclear weapons by tomorrow's date.

229
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,240
Iran can fire that on Israel.  So

230
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,560
Israel fears that Iran should

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,959
not make nuclear weapons at any cost and that is why

232
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,279
Israel continuously tries to attack Iran as much as possible through cyber attacks or

233
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,440
directly through missile attacks etc.

234
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,200

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Well,

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,919
if you look at the recent past, many Iran-backed

237
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,680
groups have chosen Israeli and

238
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,080
Western targets in Syria,

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,640
Iraq and Yemen and have attacked there.

240
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,959
Then Israel feels

241
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,959
that high profile strikes should be

242
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,800
continuously carried out on Iranian personnel.   This should be done

243
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
on the nuclear infrastructure

244
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,440
so that it can keep Iran under pressure.

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,760
And look, Iran's nuclear program is

246
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
advancing very rapidly.  What I

247
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,080
mean to say is that

248
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,160
if Iran increases the enrichment of uranium

249
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,160
beyond 90% then it will be

250
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,399
able to develop nuclear weapons.  What it is right now is being

251
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
said to be 60-70%.  So, it

252
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,800
is quite close.  Because of this, the

253
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,880
entire international community

254
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,320
keeps a constant watch on this place.

255
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,080
What could be a good war scenario?  Most

256
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,640
probably it is being said that

257
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,120
after US withdraws, Israel will do the same because see

258
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,839
what Trump said here?  It could be a

259
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,480
dangerous place.  This means that a

260
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,480
major war can break out in the Middle East and Israel can launch a major

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,160
strike on Iranian nuclear

262
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,640
sites.  This is a huge

263
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,200
possibility.  And if this happens,

264
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,200
a big war will break out here and you can understand that Iran will

265
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,959
also not lag behind and Iran will also continuously attack here

266
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,120
through ballistic missiles etc.  It is

267
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,600
possible that

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,680

269
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920

270
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,920
they may

271
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,880
start attacking many Israeli cities, cities, military bases, US assets and due to this

272
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,320

273
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,800
you may see a change in the entire regional balance.

274
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,880
Hezbollah and Hamas can also open additional fronts.

275
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,640
Rebels from Yemen

276
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,200
can attack.  And it is possible that

277
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,920
Yemen is basically Saudi Arabia,

278
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
if you see here, Yemen can basically start attacking Saudi Arabia,

279
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,040
UAE on many of their oil

280
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
bases etc.

281
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
So, as I

282
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,040
told you, a big war can break out.  Anyway, the

283
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,200
question here is what could be the geopolitical impact of America's

284
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
withdrawal from the Middle East

285
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,040
?

286
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,440
Look, if we look at it in the short term,

287
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,920
what happens here is that US Trump wants that the lives of the

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,880
US people should be

289
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,320
saved.  There are chances of war there.

290
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
So, because of this, it might be

291
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
known to the American people also.  So, we are

292
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
removing him from there.  What's more, there are

293
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,920
mid-terms in America next year.   There

294
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,920
is an election.  So even before that,

295
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,680
Trump wants to project his anti-war image here.  Apart from

296
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,440
this, the long

297
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,440
term implication here could be that the

298
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,760
regional influence of America is

299
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,760
definitely going to worsen.  It is going to be weak

300
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,000
, it is going to be weak.  And because of this,

301
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,480
a huge power vacuum will be created

302
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,240
in the Middle East which different players will now

303
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
try to capture.  For

304
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,120
example, if we talk about

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,440
what can happen next in this entire region?  If we

306
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,480
talk about Iran, Iran will become more empathetic

307
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,640
due to the US departure and will try to

308
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,640
expand its regional hegemony.

309
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
As far as Israel is concerned, it

310
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,040

311
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
can definitely be a big setback for Israel that

312
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,959
America will not be able to help it the way it used to earlier

313
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,279
and obviously Saudi Arabia and the

314
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
rest of the Gulf states will now have to

315
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,399
protect themselves and terror

316
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,120
groups like ISIS will get a big encouragement for them

317
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,120
and they will try to expand their means, the

318
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,440

319
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,160
ISIS groups and it is a

320
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,480
big opportunity for Russia and China as well that whatever

321
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,880
gap will be created due to US departure,

322
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,040
they will take advantage of that opportunity.  In

323
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,680
fact, if you look

324
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,880
historically, you

325
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,120
get to see such things many times.  When

326
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,680
America withdrew from Vietnam in 1975.  The

327
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,720
war lasted for 20 years.  America had lost.

328
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,560
He did not have the courage.  That means the whole

329
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
world knew about this.  But the American

330
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,480
President was in a way telling the people of America.

331
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,079
Look what a big victory we have

332
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
achieved.  This actually did not happen.

333
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,399
So the US had withdrawn

334
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,200
from Vietnam.  In 2011, Obama withdrew

335
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,839
from Iraq and a vacuum was created there

336
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,680
and this led to ISIS.  The

337
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,639
way ISIS expanded, that was one

338
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,959
of the big reasons why Obama withdrew his troops

339
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,360
from Iraq.  In 2021,

340
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,279
Biden exited Afghanistan.

341
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
And at that time, you will remember, the Taliban had

342
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,440
completely taken over.  So this time too it is being

343
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,519
said somewhere that

344
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,440
if Trump is withdrawing from here then in

345
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,920
a way a big vacuum will be created

346
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,839
and we will have to see who tries to capture it now.

347
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,279
So this was the whole video

348
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,639
friends.  I hope you have understood it well

349
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,399
and before leaving, a very

350
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,160
interesting question.  Look at the Abraham

351
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,320
Accord which was broken by the US.

352
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,880
It involves normalization

353
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,720
of ties between Israel and which of the

354
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
following countries?  I have to tell you this.  And

355
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
you all know the right answer to this.   You

356
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't

357
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
matter if you are not there.  You

358
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
can get its correct answer from Telegram and

359
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,399
I keep posting many MCQs in my stories.

360
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,160
And friends, as I

361
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
told you, I am preparing for UPSC.  The

362
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,120
Great Learning Festival is underway.

363
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,800
