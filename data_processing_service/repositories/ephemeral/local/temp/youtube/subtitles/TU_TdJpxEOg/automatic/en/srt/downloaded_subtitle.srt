00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,880
Prashant Dhawan. Now recently you might have

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,200
seen the news that Iran has opened its airspace for India

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,920
so that

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
we can bring Indian students back to India,

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,320
not only Indian students, actually now there is

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,720
talk that even students from Nepal and the neighboring

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,920
countries will also be evacuated by

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,160
India. Now, this gesture of Iran was very

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
special.  Even Israel is bombing them today.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,000
He

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,559
facilitated India.  But let me tell you that no

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,280
country ever helps for free.

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,120
If Iran is helping us, it is

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,120
opening its airspace to evacuate our students.  Immediately

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
after that I saw that the On Voice and

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,920
Deputy On Voice of Iran were in India.  Here you will

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,160
see that the Iranian Deputy Ambassador has

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,120
recently requested India that

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
India will have to put pressure on Israel.  The

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,440
big players in the world, the big

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,920
countries that stand with peace, should

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,840
immediately put pressure on Israel

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,479
that whatever Israel is doing today, the

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
bombing it is doing, it should stop it immediately.

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,159
You will see that many

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,479
articles have been published on this and

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,040
you will see that a specific statement has come from Iran

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,880
which India will pay a lot of attention to.

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,280
Tan has said that if India says that

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,600
it is the leader of the Global South.  Now

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,720
I've made videos in the past about the Global South.

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,159

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,040
India has said many times that it will

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,280
always be ready for the countries in the Global South.  India will

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,159
lead the Global South because

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,119
India is the most powerful economy in the Global South.  So Iran

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,840
raised the question here that if India

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,560
wants to lead the Global South then it should

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,720
deny Israeli military aggression.  Not

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
only are they saying that tell Israel to

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,119
stop this attack.  Openly

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
condemn the Israeli military.  You will see that

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,600
in India, Sonia Gandhi has also recently

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
given this statement that India should openly

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200
stand behind Iran.  Israel should be condemned,

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,960
why is Israel doing all this.

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,360
The way you can say,

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,440
China is giving statements nowadays.

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
And as far as this Global South is concerned, let me show you a

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,319
map.  From that you will understand

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,879
why Iran is saying that if India wants to

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,680
become the leader of the Global South, then it will have to

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,319
condemn Israel.  Now

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
according to a classification by the UN, the world is divided in this manner.

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,160
This does not mean that there

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,280
is any border etc.  This is just

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,160
a way of looking at the world that the Global South is

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,680
a side where progress has been slow.  There are poor

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,480
countries overall and then there is the Global North where there are

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,120
developed countries.  So

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
this is a classification between developing countries and developed countries,

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
Global North and Global

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,599
South.  Direction has no role in this

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,920
that people living in the North have

67
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,160
progressed here.  Those from the South were left behind.

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,319
For example, Australia and New Zealand

69
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
both come in the South.  But still

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,400
they are considered part of the Global North.

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,640
Now if you look at the Global South,

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,440
you will find many countries where the majority

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,920
religion is Islam and the majority population

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,080
there does not like Israel.  For

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,120
example, Pakistan comes in the Global South.

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,360
Bangladesh comes.  Here Iran falls

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
in the Global South.  Comes Saudi Arabia.

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,920
Interestingly, Israel does not fall in the Global South.

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,440
Because even two is Israel's

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,000
position.  Here you will see that it

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,640
is in the Global South.  But Israel is a developed country.

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,440
So here Iran says that

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,840
if you look at OIC alone, there are more than 56 countries.

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,040
You will find this in the Global South.  So

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,799
if India wants to project itself as a leader of the Global South,

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
we try to do this many times.

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
PM Modi has held many summits on this.

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,080
Many times you must have seen that

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,879
PM Modi is addressing various leaders

90
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,040
of the Global South during an online summit.

91
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,879
Now PM Modi will

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,799
also visit many countries which

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,360
fall in the Global South.  You will notice that in the last few

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,680
years, PM Modi has been visiting mostly those

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
countries which are in the Global South.

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,560
So Iran has clearly said

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,280
that India will be able to become the leader of the Global South only

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,439
if it condemns Israel.  And

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,840
to a large extent, this is true.  There is a lot of anger towards Israel in the Global South today.

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,080

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,560
Not only in those countries where Islam is the

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,880
main religion.  Even for example, if I

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,359
look at South Africa, you will see that South

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,040
Africa is dominantly a Christian

105
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,440
country.  The main religion here

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,600
is Christianity.  But still these people are the biggest critics

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,320
of Israel.  Now the question here is

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
what should India do and

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,960
if we look at India's stand as of now,

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,360
India has openly said that

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,120
we have good relations with Iran and

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,080
we also have good relations with Israel.  But at the

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,320
same time, the interesting thing is that you must have

114
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,120
heard about SCO, Shanghai

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,680
Corporation Organization, India is a

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,680
member here.  Pakistan is also a member.

117
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,479
Many countries including China are part of SCO.

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,199
Recently a

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,560
statement was prepared in SEO where Israel was to be

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,040
condemned.  India was the only country which

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,400
abandoned this statement and did

122
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,479
not criticize Israel in SEO. The Israeli

123
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
ambassador to India

124
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,919
also praised India regarding this, see,

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,240
you have done a very good job by supporting Israel here.

126
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,160
So again it depends on

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,840
which perspective you are looking from.

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
As you all know, Sonia Gandhi is a

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,759
veteran leader of the Congress Party.

130
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,560
He recently said that

131
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,880
why is India so silent?  Israel is continuously bombing

132
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,520
Iran and at the same time it has

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,600
also criticized Donald Trump and Benjamin Nitin on Yahoo

134
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,520
and once again you

135
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
can ask here that the war between Israel and Iran has been going on for

136
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,880
more than a week.

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,520
This war is going on continuously and recently this

138
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,000
article has come out that Israel is

139
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
warming Iran so heavily that

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,240
you can say that there are earthquakes in many places.

141
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,240
Now what is the reason that perhaps

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,400
these attacks have happened,

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,479
some big underground explosion has taken place on the nuclear program of Iran

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,360
because

145
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,960
we are seeing these earthquakes happening one after the other in Iran

146
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
and it seems that perhaps Iran is

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
trying to do nuclear testing

148
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
or some of their standard fuses are being

149
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
destroyed.  But

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,039
anyway, something very strange is happening in Iran today,

151
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,960
about which the

152
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,000
world will get more clarity in the coming days.

153
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,520
Now at this time, can India criticize

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,759
Israel or Iran?  See again it really

155
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
depends on how you see it.

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,440
See, in Operation Sindhu, Israel will also cooperate with India.

157
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,720
Because let me tell you this,

158
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,720
Operation Sindhu is not just about evacuating our citizens from Iran.  There is

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639

160
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
also Operation Sindhu for Indian citizens in Israel who want to return.

161
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,440

162
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,000
So, whatever cooperation Iran is doing,

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Israel will also do it.  Interestingly, Israel did

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
not tell India to condemn Iran.

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,639
But Iran has a clear

166
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,280
expectation here that if in future India wants to

167
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,759

168
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,840
advance its diplomacy in the Global South, then in that case it will have to absolutely

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,160
condemn the aggression of the Israeli military.

170
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,160
Otherwise you can understand that

171
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
in future Global South summits of India, perhaps

172
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,479
these people will

173
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,960
not show as much involvement as they should

174
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,599
because China is standing on the other side.  China is

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,639
openly criticizing Israel today.

176
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,960
So again this is a very

177
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,520
difficult geopolitical decision

178
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,319
for India.  On one hand, India's dream is to

179
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,280
become the leader of the Global South.  On the other hand,

180
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,840
if we look at this, the

181
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,919
India Middle East Economic Corridor,

182
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
if we see it literally, it will go through Israel

183
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,560
and if suppose Israel

184
