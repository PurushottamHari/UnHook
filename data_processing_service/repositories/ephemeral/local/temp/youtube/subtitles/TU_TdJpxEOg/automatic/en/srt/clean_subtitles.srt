Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now recently you might have seen the news that Iran has opened its airspace for India so that we can bring Indian students back to India, not only Indian students, actually now there is talk that even students from Nepal and the neighboring countries will also be evacuated by India. Now, this gesture of Iran was very special.  Even Israel is bombing them today. He facilitated India.  But let me tell you that no country ever helps for free. If Iran is helping us, it is opening its airspace to evacuate our students.  Immediately after that I saw that the On Voice and Deputy On Voice of Iran were in India.  Here you will see that the Iranian Deputy Ambassador has recently requested India that India will have to put pressure on Israel.  The big players in the world, the big countries that stand with peace, should immediately put pressure on Israel that whatever Israel is doing today, the bombing it is doing, it should stop it immediately. You will see that many articles have been published on this and you will see that a specific statement has come from Iran which India will pay a lot of attention to. Tan has said that if India says that it is the leader of the Global South.  Now I've made videos in the past about the Global South. India has said many times that it will always be ready for the countries in the Global South.  India will lead the Global South because India is the most powerful economy in the Global South.  So Iran raised the question here that if India wants to lead the Global South then it should deny Israeli military aggression.  Not only are they saying that tell Israel to stop this attack.  Openly condemn the Israeli military.  You will see that in India, Sonia Gandhi has also recently given this statement that India should openly stand behind Iran.  Israel should be condemned, why is Israel doing all this. The way you can say, China is giving statements nowadays. And as far as this Global South is concerned, let me show you a map.  From that you will understand why Iran is saying that if India wants to become the leader of the Global South, then it will have to condemn Israel.  Now according to a classification by the UN, the world is divided in this manner. This does not mean that there is any border etc.  This is just a way of looking at the world that the Global South is a side where progress has been slow.  There are poor countries overall and then there is the Global North where there are developed countries.  So this is a classification between developing countries and developed countries, Global North and Global South.  Direction has no role in this that people living in the North have progressed here.  Those from the South were left behind. For example, Australia and New Zealand both come in the South.  But still they are considered part of the Global North. Now if you look at the Global South, you will find many countries where the majority religion is Islam and the majority population there does not like Israel.  For example, Pakistan comes in the Global South. Bangladesh comes.  Here Iran falls in the Global South.  Comes Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, Israel does not fall in the Global South. Because even two is Israel's position.  Here you will see that it is in the Global South.  But Israel is a developed country. So here Iran says that if you look at OIC alone, there are more than 56 countries. You will find this in the Global South.  So if India wants to project itself as a leader of the Global South, we try to do this many times. PM Modi has held many summits on this. Many times you must have seen that PM Modi is addressing various leaders of the Global South during an online summit. Now PM Modi will also visit many countries which fall in the Global South.  You will notice that in the last few years, PM Modi has been visiting mostly those countries which are in the Global South. So Iran has clearly said that India will be able to become the leader of the Global South only if it condemns Israel.  And to a large extent, this is true.  There is a lot of anger towards Israel in the Global South today. Not only in those countries where Islam is the main religion.  Even for example, if I look at South Africa, you will see that South Africa is dominantly a Christian country.  The main religion here is Christianity.  But still these people are the biggest critics of Israel.  Now the question here is what should India do and if we look at India's stand as of now, India has openly said that we have good relations with Iran and we also have good relations with Israel.  But at the same time, the interesting thing is that you must have heard about SCO, Shanghai Corporation Organization, India is a member here.  Pakistan is also a member. Many countries including China are part of SCO. Recently a statement was prepared in SEO where Israel was to be condemned.  India was the only country which abandoned this statement and did not criticize Israel in SEO. The Israeli ambassador to India also praised India regarding this, see, you have done a very good job by supporting Israel here. So again it depends on which perspective you are looking from. As you all know, Sonia Gandhi is a veteran leader of the Congress Party. He recently said that why is India so silent?  Israel is continuously bombing Iran and at the same time it has also criticized Donald Trump and Benjamin Nitin on Yahoo and once again you can ask here that the war between Israel and Iran has been going on for more than a week. This war is going on continuously and recently this article has come out that Israel is warming Iran so heavily that you can say that there are earthquakes in many places. Now what is the reason that perhaps these attacks have happened, some big underground explosion has taken place on the nuclear program of Iran because we are seeing these earthquakes happening one after the other in Iran and it seems that perhaps Iran is trying to do nuclear testing or some of their standard fuses are being destroyed.  But anyway, something very strange is happening in Iran today, about which the world will get more clarity in the coming days. Now at this time, can India criticize Israel or Iran?  See again it really depends on how you see it. See, in Operation Sindhu, Israel will also cooperate with India. Because let me tell you this, Operation Sindhu is not just about evacuating our citizens from Iran.  There is also Operation Sindhu for Indian citizens in Israel who want to return. So, whatever cooperation Iran is doing, Israel will also do it.  Interestingly, Israel did not tell India to condemn Iran. But Iran has a clear expectation here that if in future India wants to advance its diplomacy in the Global South, then in that case it will have to absolutely condemn the aggression of the Israeli military. Otherwise you can understand that in future Global South summits of India, perhaps these people will not show as much involvement as they should because China is standing on the other side.  China is openly criticizing Israel today. So again this is a very difficult geopolitical decision for India.  On one hand, India's dream is to become the leader of the Global South.  On the other hand, if we look at this, the India Middle East Economic Corridor, if we see it literally, it will go through Israel and if suppose Israel changes the regime in Iran, then in that case you will see a big change in the Global South.
