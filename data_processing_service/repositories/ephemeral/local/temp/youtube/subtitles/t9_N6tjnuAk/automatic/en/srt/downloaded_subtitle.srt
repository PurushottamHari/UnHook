00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello Friends.  Friends, sometimes the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,080
truth has to come out.  Even if it takes a little

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,919
time.  You must have noticed that there are

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,639
many things from the time of World War 2

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,040
which are coming to light today.  The truth is coming out today.

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,679
But I did not know that

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
Pakistan would accept things so quickly.

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,960
Here you can see that finally

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,840
Pakistan has admitted that they asked

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,480
for ceasefire.  Pakistan had first asked

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,480
for ceasefire.  And I am

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
not talking about any ordinary deep person.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,559
Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister has

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,800
admitted this.  You can see this news.

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,840
Pakistan Deputy Prime Minister Ishq Dar

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,399
finally admits they asked for ceasefire

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,239
after India struck their air bases.  So there

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,320
is a need to understand this in a little detail as to

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
what exactly has happened?

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,120
What happened suddenly?  In fact, if you see, the

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,520
way Donald Trump used to say earlier with his chest puffed up that

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,840
I got it done,

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,399
I did all the mediation.  I mean, the way

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,239
he was speaking, it seemed as if

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,079
everything was done by him.  But

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
finally here he also took a U-turn,

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,120
I will discuss that also with you.

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
Let's move on.  But before that,

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880
friends, let me tell you all those of you who are

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,280
started.  Look, you

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,159
all already know the background that first of all on 22nd

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,640
April, the terrorists attacked and

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,799
shot at the innocent people in Pahalgam.

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,040
Due to this there was a lot of anger

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
within the country.  And you all know the blame for all this.  The

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
best terror

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,200
groups of Pakistan are Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar Taiba

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
and the Pakistan government and Pakistan

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
army itself.  The way a

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,119
conspiracy has been hatched here.  Well,

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,640
India gave a befitting reply to this,

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,119
you all know it by the name of Operation Sindoor.  The

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,920
night of the sixth and seventh of May.  So at that time

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,720
we carried out a precise air strike.

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,439
Launched a missile strike campaign.  If you look at the Pakistani

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,840
terrorist air launch pads and terrorist

54
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,240
areas, we have carried out

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,079
direct attacks at many places there.

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,640
And this was our attempt; we clearly

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,640
said after this attack that we had

58
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,040
only targeted the terrorists.

59
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,520
We have no intention of going to war or of

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
escalating the war.  But yes,

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
if Pakistan takes any action then we will

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
give a befitting reply.  And the same thing happened.

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
You must have seen in the next three-four days

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,440
what kind of response comes from Pakistan.

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,400
Then India responds to it.  So this is

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,040
how things were going.  But in the

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,680
10th, you must remember the way India

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,080
attacked Pakistan's airbases,

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,640
again you can see this on the map.   There

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,120
are many Airbuses.  From the top,

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,760
from north to south.  So there

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,239
are especially three airbases here.  One is in Rawalpindi which

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
became Noor Khan Airbase.  There is a lot of discussion about him.  A

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,760
video also came out showing

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
how the attack was carried out here.

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,360
Because that becomes very important

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,000
for Pakistan.  The

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
top military fighter jets and VVIP

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
flights are there.  The command

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
infrastructure radar and command

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
infrastructure is there.  And

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
somewhere India caused huge damage

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,280
to Noor Khan Airbase using Brahmos and Play missiles.

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,599
Apart from this,

85
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,519
you can see the Shorkot Airbase in Rafiki.  There was

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
huge damage here too.  Apart from this,

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,319

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,920
you can see the Rahim Yar Khan airbase in South Punjab,

89
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
in the South of Punjab, that is,

90
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,560
in the South of Pakistan's Punjab, a massive

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,280
attack was carried out there also by India, that means in a

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,280
way the backbone of Pakistan was broken by

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,519
attacking their air bases, what will they be

94
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
able to do now if they start getting finished at the air bases itself, so

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,159
see what has happened here,

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
Ishaqdar who is both the deputy prime

97
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,720
minister and foreign minister of Pakistan, the

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,280
candidate admission was done and at

99
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,879
that time during the televised interview,

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,760
I am not talking about any article

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,599
that people can lie.

102
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
I have seen this proper video and then I made this video

103
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,640
on Pakistani news channel.

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,480

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,080
See what those who are in love themselves are saying while talking here.  He

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,439
said first of all yes we asked for cease

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,239
fire.  We ourselves had asked for ceasefire.

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,959
There is no shame in admitting that things were

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,360
escalating beyond our control.  We are

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,400
accepting that things were

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,560
going out of our control.  So, there is no shame in it

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,799
if we say that we had earlier asked for

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,199
ceasefire and see

114
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,919
what they said on the basis of after India struck, I

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,080
mean, as I told you, this

116
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,400
was the turning point for Pakistan, Noor

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,280
Khan Airbase, Shortat Airbase, they themselves named

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,080
these two airbases, when India

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,600
attacked at exactly 2-3:00 in the night.  At that

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,919
time, only 45 minutes later,

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Pakistan receives a call from Saudi Prince Faisal.  This is being

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,880
said by Faisal, the Prince of Saudi Arabia.

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
If you remember, where was the Prime Minister when the

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,040
terrorist attack took place in Pahalgam

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,840
?  He was

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,759
in Saudi Arabia.  So definitely things are not the same as before that if

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,320
Saudi Arabia used to

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,720
support Pakistan then the same thing will happen now.  Things have

129
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,720
changed completely.  As of today,

130
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,360
Saudi Arabia is neutral in the India-Pakistan issue in

131
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
a way.  So in a way it is

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,440
not that Saudi Arabia will

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,120
support Pakistan.  So Prime Minister Modi had also

134
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,199
gone on a visit to Saudi Arabia.  He

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,080
cut short his tour and returned back to India.

136
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,639
So what happens here is that within 45 minutes

137
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,199
Saudi Prince Faisal makes a

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,360
call to Pakistan, and looking at the

139
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,759
kind of loss Pakistan had suffered,

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
Prince Faisal asked

141
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,960
Pakistan that what do you want, that things should be

142
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,160
stopped here.  What I mean to say is, should I

143
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,479
convey your message to India?  In fact,

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,960
he took the name of S Jaishankar and said that should I

145
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,320
call S Jaishankar Sahib and tell him

146
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,120
that Pakistan wants ceasefire, then

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,919
he said yes, we have said yes and

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
said yes, please convey our message.

149
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,400
See what happens,

150
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,240
in the first step two countries do not call directly.

151
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,160
Somewhere or the other a

152
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
call comes through an intermediary that Pakistan wants this.

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
Then after that it is obvious that the

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
DGMO of Pakistan would have called the

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
DGMO of India saying let's do

156
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
the ceasefire.  Then things would have happened.  Meaning,

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,479
its meaning is clear that there has been a

158
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
ceasefire directly between Pakistan and India.

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,800
Here,

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,880
Faisal, the Prince of Saudi Arabia, once said that

161
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
yes, Pakistan wants a ceasefire.

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,680
Then things have progressed.  So I

163
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,840
asked if he could relate to India's

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,039
Foreign Minister that Pakistan wanted to

165
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,600
halt further conflict and I told him

166
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,199
yes.  We also requested US intervention.

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
So they are also saying that there was US

168
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
intervention.  I will come forward on this

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,199
because Pakistan was afraid that this would turn

170
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,800
into a full blown war like you are seeing right now between Israel

171
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,800
and Iran.  So

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,039
what will happen to Pakistan?  So you

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,759
can understand it.  So in a way, what was India's

174
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,280
strategic message?  When India first

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,160
attacked terrorist launchpads on the

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,319
night of 6th and 7th May, we had

177
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,840
clearly told Pakistan that we do

178
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,319
not want to escalate things.  We are

179
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,400
not doing civilian casualties.

180
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
But Pakistan did not agree, it also had to show it

181
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,680
to its audience and ultimately

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,919
Pakistan was surprised.  Its military suffered

183
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,840
a lot of damage and finally, due to international

184
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,080
pressure or even pressure among its audience,

185
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,759
this ceasefire happened.  Well,

186
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
what is its impact on Pakistan?   The

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
impact is that their radar

188
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,039
infrastructure, aircraft shelters and

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,960
logistics points have suffered heavy

190
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,599
damage.  In fact, the latest news that has come is

191
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,560
till 4th June, sorry, from July to

192
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,039
June, your Rahim Yar Khan

193
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,280
base is still under repair.

194
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,520
It hasn't even become operational yet.  Just imagine what was the

195
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,680
condition of the airbase there.

196
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,280
Pakistan has suffered a strategic setback.   The

197
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,039
military doctrine

198
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,599
of Pakistan has been exposed

199
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,599
here as to how weak their air defence system was.

200
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,520
India's missiles were

201
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,360
going directly into them and attacking.

202
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,039
Pakistan tried a lot

203
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
but India's air defense system

204
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,960
remained very strong and

205
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,759
you will also see domestic political pressure.  Why is

206
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
this important?  Why does it matter so much

207
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,160
?  Because the first thing is that for the first

208
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,360
time Pakistan has officially acknowledged that they

209
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,440
ask for peace under military

210
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
pressure.  So, do you understand?  And secondly, here

211
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,240
it confirms India's operational

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
success, which was our objective of without

213
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
war.  In a way, he achieved it.  Here the

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,360
deterrence posture of Pakistan has been

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,919
revealed.  Especially India's

216
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,080
conventional dominance at this time.

217
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,000
Things like nuclear war etc. will happen, that will become a different matter altogether.

218
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,879
But

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,879
everyone knew about India's strength in conventional war,

220
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
but this time India showed it.  Then,

221
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,440
India has had a diplomatic victory somewhere

222
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,360
due to this admission into it.  And here the

223
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
third party mediators, in a

224
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
way the Prince of Saudi Arabia just

225
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
convened the matter.  So it also matters to a great extent

226
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,200
that yes was said from there.  So

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
what is the geopolitical real effect, that the

228
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
ripple effect here is that Saudi Arabia has emerged as a

229
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
credible intermediary or

230
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,919
whatever it is because

231
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,920
Saudi Arabia has good relations with both.

232
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
Secondly, as far as America is concerned,

233
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,240
many questions are now being raised regarding this.  Because

234
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,160
if you see, Donald Trump

235
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
took a U-turn here.  And you never know,

236
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
take a U-turn again on tomorrow's date.

237
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,640
Because look what Donald Trump was saying till now

238
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,120
?  He was repeatedly saying that

239
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,120
he should get personal credit here.  The way the

240
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,600
ceasefire happened was completely

241
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,600
his personal intervention.  In

242
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,240
fact, people had already got suspicious because of him,

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,000
because the Vice President, J.D. Vance, had

244
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
even said,

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
what do we have to do with this?  Meaning that one day

246
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
before you are saying

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
what do we have to do with this India-Pakistan war

248
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,760
and the very next day Donald Trump is saying

249
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,080
that the credit goes to me.  How

250
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,160
can this be possible?  Right?  So you will

251
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
get to see this thing.  So Don Trump was initially making

252
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,240
too many claims that I

253
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
got it done, I got it done, give me the credit.  But

254
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,560
what happened here is that India

255
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,120
completely denied it.  We had a single

256
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,440
stand.  There was only one stand.  And

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
here you can see that finally

258
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,519
Donald Trump has taken a U-turn.  Because just now when

259
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
he met Pakistan's Army Chief Asim

260
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,920
Munir, look at

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,160
what his statement was at that time.  They mean India and

262
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Pakistan are very smart people.  Meaning he

263
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,720
was telling Asim Munir and PM Modi that they are

264
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,440
very smart people.  They decided not to keep

265
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,000
going with that war.  I thank them.

266
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,920
So look, I am not saying that Donald

267
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,839
Trump has completely accepted that

268
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,680
yes, he had no role in it.  He will still

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
say that it was his role.  But

270
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,640
now you will see their stance becoming a bit soft.

271
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
Earlier, I was maintaining a very hard stance.

272
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,320
I have got it done and there is no one else.

273
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,079
So see what is the reason behind this?   The

274
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,959
first thing is obvious.  The

275
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,040
35 minute conversation with PM Modi ji.

276
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,200
It became crystal clear.  After that conversation,

277
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,680
you can see that it has been said very clearly from our side, the

278
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,760
Foreign Secretary has been

279
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,160
told this thing clearly that in the

280
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,399
conversation that happened in the phone call, PM

281
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,640
Modi explained to Donald Trump that it did

282
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
not happen because of you.  India has

283
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
never done mediation here in the past and has not done it now

284
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,360
and will not do it in the future either

285
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,920
because Shimla Agreement clearly states

286
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,160
that there will be

287
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,240
no involvement of third party in Indo-Pak matter.

288
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
So in a way, Trump's statement was facing backlash in India too.

289
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,440
Somewhere, it could be that now Donald Trump is

291
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,519
trying to do damage control

292
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,680
because if you look at the relations between India and US, there has been a

293
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,680
slight turn.  The

294
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,760
way the relationship between the two was getting better at a rapid pace.

295
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Now here

296
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,519
you will see a little up and down.

297
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Especially the meeting which took place after the departure of Asim Munir.

298
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
Well, whatever it is, this

299
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,279
admission of Pakistan

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
matters a lot to us now.  Now there is complete video

301
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,880
proof of this.  That you can't say this now.  They

302
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
say that it is an article, then you will say

303
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
that no, this is a wrong article.  We did

304
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
not say anything.  You can't even say this.

305
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,279
Well whatever, before I leave, can you tell me one interesting

306
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,600
question?  Which of the

307
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,440
following Indian military operations with their

308
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
respective events is correct?  I have to tell you this.

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
