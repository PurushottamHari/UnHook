Hello Friends.  Friends, sometimes the truth has to come out.  Even if it takes a little time.  You must have noticed that there are many things from the time of World War 2 which are coming to light today.  The truth is coming out today. But I did not know that Pakistan would accept things so quickly. Here you can see that finally Pakistan has admitted that they asked for ceasefire.  Pakistan had first asked for ceasefire.  And I am not talking about any ordinary deep person. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister has admitted this.  You can see this news. Pakistan Deputy Prime Minister Ishq Dar finally admits they asked for ceasefire after India struck their air bases.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail as to what exactly has happened? What happened suddenly?  In fact, if you see, the way Donald Trump used to say earlier with his chest puffed up that I got it done, I did all the mediation.  I mean, the way he was speaking, it seemed as if everything was done by him.  But finally here he also took a U-turn, I will discuss that also with you. Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all those of you who are preparing for UPSC.  You can definitely avail our Pratigya batch.  If you need any information related to this batch, please call this phone number. Our team will let you know.  will guide you everything and you can use this code Ankit live so that you can get maximum discount.  Let's get started.  Look, you all already know the background that first of all on 22nd April, the terrorists attacked and shot at the innocent people in Pahalgam. Due to this there was a lot of anger within the country.  And you all know the blame for all this.  The best terror groups of Pakistan are Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar Taiba and the Pakistan government and Pakistan army itself.  The way a conspiracy has been hatched here.  Well, India gave a befitting reply to this, you all know it by the name of Operation Sindoor.  The night of the sixth and seventh of May.  So at that time we carried out a precise air strike. Launched a missile strike campaign.  If you look at the Pakistani terrorist air launch pads and terrorist areas, we have carried out direct attacks at many places there. And this was our attempt; we clearly said after this attack that we had only targeted the terrorists. We have no intention of going to war or of escalating the war.  But yes, if Pakistan takes any action then we will give a befitting reply.  And the same thing happened. You must have seen in the next three-four days what kind of response comes from Pakistan. Then India responds to it.  So this is how things were going.  But in the 10th, you must remember the way India attacked Pakistan's airbases, again you can see this on the map.   There are many Airbuses.  From the top, from north to south.  So there are especially three airbases here.  One is in Rawalpindi which became Noor Khan Airbase.  There is a lot of discussion about him.  A video also came out showing how the attack was carried out here. Because that becomes very important for Pakistan.  The top military fighter jets and VVIP flights are there.  The command infrastructure radar and command infrastructure is there.  And somewhere India caused huge damage to Noor Khan Airbase using Brahmos and Play missiles. Apart from this, you can see the Shorkot Airbase in Rafiki.  There was huge damage here too.  Apart from this, you can see the Rahim Yar Khan airbase in South Punjab, in the South of Punjab, that is, in the South of Pakistan's Punjab, a massive attack was carried out there also by India, that means in a way the backbone of Pakistan was broken by attacking their air bases, what will they be able to do now if they start getting finished at the air bases itself, so see what has happened here, Ishaqdar who is both the deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Pakistan, the candidate admission was done and at that time during the televised interview, I am not talking about any article that people can lie. I have seen this proper video and then I made this video on Pakistani news channel. See what those who are in love themselves are saying while talking here.  He said first of all yes we asked for cease fire.  We ourselves had asked for ceasefire. There is no shame in admitting that things were escalating beyond our control.  We are accepting that things were going out of our control.  So, there is no shame in it if we say that we had earlier asked for ceasefire and see what they said on the basis of after India struck, I mean, as I told you, this was the turning point for Pakistan, Noor Khan Airbase, Shortat Airbase, they themselves named these two airbases, when India attacked at exactly 2-3:00 in the night.  At that time, only 45 minutes later, Pakistan receives a call from Saudi Prince Faisal.  This is being said by Faisal, the Prince of Saudi Arabia. If you remember, where was the Prime Minister when the terrorist attack took place in Pahalgam ?  He was in Saudi Arabia.  So definitely things are not the same as before that if Saudi Arabia used to support Pakistan then the same thing will happen now.  Things have changed completely.  As of today, Saudi Arabia is neutral in the India-Pakistan issue in a way.  So in a way it is not that Saudi Arabia will support Pakistan.  So Prime Minister Modi had also gone on a visit to Saudi Arabia.  He cut short his tour and returned back to India. So what happens here is that within 45 minutes Saudi Prince Faisal makes a call to Pakistan, and looking at the kind of loss Pakistan had suffered, Prince Faisal asked Pakistan that what do you want, that things should be stopped here.  What I mean to say is, should I convey your message to India?  In fact, he took the name of S Jaishankar and said that should I call S Jaishankar Sahib and tell him that Pakistan wants ceasefire, then he said yes, we have said yes and said yes, please convey our message. See what happens, in the first step two countries do not call directly. Somewhere or the other a call comes through an intermediary that Pakistan wants this. Then after that it is obvious that the DGMO of Pakistan would have called the DGMO of India saying let's do the ceasefire.  Then things would have happened.  Meaning, its meaning is clear that there has been a ceasefire directly between Pakistan and India. Here, Faisal, the Prince of Saudi Arabia, once said that yes, Pakistan wants a ceasefire. Then things have progressed.  So I asked if he could relate to India's Foreign Minister that Pakistan wanted to halt further conflict and I told him yes.  We also requested US intervention. So they are also saying that there was US intervention.  I will come forward on this because Pakistan was afraid that this would turn into a full blown war like you are seeing right now between Israel and Iran.  So what will happen to Pakistan?  So you can understand it.  So in a way, what was India's strategic message?  When India first attacked terrorist launchpads on the night of 6th and 7th May, we had clearly told Pakistan that we do not want to escalate things.  We are not doing civilian casualties. But Pakistan did not agree, it also had to show it to its audience and ultimately Pakistan was surprised.  Its military suffered a lot of damage and finally, due to international pressure or even pressure among its audience, this ceasefire happened.  Well, what is its impact on Pakistan?   The impact is that their radar infrastructure, aircraft shelters and logistics points have suffered heavy damage.  In fact, the latest news that has come is till 4th June, sorry, from July to June, your Rahim Yar Khan base is still under repair. It hasn't even become operational yet.  Just imagine what was the condition of the airbase there. Pakistan has suffered a strategic setback.   The military doctrine of Pakistan has been exposed here as to how weak their air defence system was. India's missiles were going directly into them and attacking. Pakistan tried a lot but India's air defense system remained very strong and you will also see domestic political pressure.  Why is this important?  Why does it matter so much ?  Because the first thing is that for the first time Pakistan has officially acknowledged that they ask for peace under military pressure.  So, do you understand?  And secondly, here it confirms India's operational success, which was our objective of without war.  In a way, he achieved it.  Here the deterrence posture of Pakistan has been revealed.  Especially India's conventional dominance at this time. Things like nuclear war etc. will happen, that will become a different matter altogether. But everyone knew about India's strength in conventional war, but this time India showed it.  Then, India has had a diplomatic victory somewhere due to this admission into it.  And here the third party mediators, in a way the Prince of Saudi Arabia just convened the matter.  So it also matters to a great extent that yes was said from there.  So what is the geopolitical real effect, that the ripple effect here is that Saudi Arabia has emerged as a credible intermediary or whatever it is because Saudi Arabia has good relations with both. Secondly, as far as America is concerned, many questions are now being raised regarding this.  Because if you see, Donald Trump took a U-turn here.  And you never know, take a U-turn again on tomorrow's date. Because look what Donald Trump was saying till now ?  He was repeatedly saying that he should get personal credit here.  The way the ceasefire happened was completely his personal intervention.  In fact, people had already got suspicious because of him, because the Vice President, J.D. Vance, had even said, what do we have to do with this?  Meaning that one day before you are saying what do we have to do with this India-Pakistan war and the very next day Donald Trump is saying that the credit goes to me.  How can this be possible?  Right?  So you will get to see this thing.  So Don Trump was initially making too many claims that I got it done, I got it done, give me the credit.  But what happened here is that India completely denied it.  We had a single stand.  There was only one stand.  And here you can see that finally Donald Trump has taken a U-turn.  Because just now when he met Pakistan's Army Chief Asim Munir, look at what his statement was at that time.  They mean India and Pakistan are very smart people.  Meaning he was telling Asim Munir and PM Modi that they are very smart people.  They decided not to keep going with that war.  I thank them. So look, I am not saying that Donald Trump has completely accepted that yes, he had no role in it.  He will still say that it was his role.  But now you will see their stance becoming a bit soft. Earlier, I was maintaining a very hard stance. I have got it done and there is no one else. So see what is the reason behind this?   The first thing is obvious.  The 35 minute conversation with PM Modi ji. It became crystal clear.  After that conversation, you can see that it has been said very clearly from our side, the Foreign Secretary has been told this thing clearly that in the conversation that happened in the phone call, PM Modi explained to Donald Trump that it did not happen because of you.  India has never done mediation here in the past and has not done it now and will not do it in the future either because Shimla Agreement clearly states that there will be no involvement of third party in Indo-Pak matter. So in a way, Trump's statement was facing backlash in India too. Somewhere, it could be that now Donald Trump is trying to do damage control because if you look at the relations between India and US, there has been a slight turn.  The way the relationship between the two was getting better at a rapid pace. Now here you will see a little up and down. Especially the meeting which took place after the departure of Asim Munir. Well, whatever it is, this admission of Pakistan matters a lot to us now.  Now there is complete video proof of this.  That you can't say this now.  They say that it is an article, then you will say that no, this is a wrong article.  We did not say anything.  You can't even say this. Well whatever, before I leave, can you tell me one interesting question?  Which of the following Indian military operations with their respective events is correct?  I have to tell you this.
