1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720

And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

IQ.

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,239
Hello Friends.  Friends, the condition of America at this time is

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,800
such that there is hardly any corner

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,719
left in the country where rights and protests are

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,559
not being seen on a large scale.

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,040
Because of the way Donald Trump

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,440
tried to impose the immigration policy.

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,039
Due to this, protests are taking place on a large scale.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,360
In big cities.  You can see this

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,520
news: Protests spread across

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,600
US despite Trump threats.  So, let us

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
understand this in a bit of detail.  In fact,

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,079
news is also coming that American flags have

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,000
also been burnt in some cities.

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
Well, let me tell you here that

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
some other things are said about the flag in India.

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
If you look in America, there are

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
some different laws regarding the flag.  I will

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,520
tell you that in the video.  Let's move on.

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
But before that friends, let me tell you all that

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
started.  As you must be seeing, for the

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,200
past few days,

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,200
news is coming from America continuously, especially

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
in Los Angeles, you must have seen that

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,759
protests are happening on a large scale here

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,600
because the federal department

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,159
in Donald Trump's administration,

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,960
you must be hearing often about the Immigration and

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,280
Customs Enforcement, a large scale raid was carried out by them

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
in Los Angeles, due to which

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,399
continuous protests were happening, raids were happening

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,719
and vehicles were also being burnt at many places,

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,479
such scenes were coming to the fore and seeing

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,640
this, finally Donald

57
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,960
Trump also deployed the military and

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,200
because of this, its effect is being

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,200

60
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,280
seen in the surrounding states and different cities of America

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
and people are protesting on a large scale.

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
Along with this, it is also being told

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
that people have clashed with the police.

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040
100s of people are being arrested.

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,560
Chemical irritants are being used by the

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,560
police and the military

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,959
to disperse the crowd.

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
Well, what is the reason behind all this?

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,560
What is a trigger?  I will tell you that quickly.

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
Look, this current wave of

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,120
protests that is going on right now, it is mainly because

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,599
Donald Trump's administration's

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,599
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICU)

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,840
started a crackdown,

75
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,840
especially in Los Angeles. The

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,319
Department of Homeland Security there

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,640
instructed that no

78
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,879
person who is undocumented and has a

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,599
past record should be spared.

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,680
Basically, efforts were being made to deport them.

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,840
And that is why, if you see,

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,400
continuous raids were started here since early morning

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,720
last week and raids were being conducted by the federal department in many

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,720
immigrant-heavy areas.  Keep in

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,920

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
mind that

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,519
when I say Federal Department, just like

88
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
in India we call it Centre, or Central Government, in the same

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,519
way the Trump Administration is also called Central Government.

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,519
Apart from this, families were also being detained.  The

91
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,680
children were also being

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,000
included in this.  Those who were

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
residents in America for a very long time were also being

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,400
arrested.  Then

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,560
along with this, militarization was also used.

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,800
And somewhere this made people even

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,280
more angry.  Apart from this, attempts were being made to

98
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,200
deport people without any legal council.  At the same

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
time,

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,959
reports were coming that racial

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,799
profiling was being done here, meaning that if you

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
belonged to this particular race then

103
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
you were being specifically targeted here.

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
For example, Latinos, Muslims,

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
South Asians, Africans were all being

106
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,200
specifically targeted.  And

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,120
that became the trigger point due to which

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,440
you got to see this entire protest.   In

109
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,760
fact, the matter escalated when

110
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,159
Donald Trump first used the National Guard

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,080
, used the military, and

112
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,400
what's more, Donald Trump did this: the

113
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,360
US Marines, that is, the elite

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,439
force that operates

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
in foreign countries, it is very rare that

116
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,840
you are used for domestic purposes.

117
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,200
So the US Marines were also

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
called inside Los Angeles.  In fact, the

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,840
Governor of California

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
even said that

121
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,000
you were seeing things like democracy under assault.

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
And that is why you will see this wide spread

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,479
outrage in many cities.

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
And what are the major hotspots?  One thing is

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
Los Angeles, where this whole thing

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
started, that still exists.  Apart from this, in

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,880
fact, if you look in Los Angeles,

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,639
such scenes were coming to the fore.

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,400
People were protesting.  In fact,

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,960
there was also New York City

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,720
where tens of thousands of people began

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,479
gathering at Times Square in Brooklyn.  The

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
protesters had

134
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,560
started climbing the federal building.

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,880
And keeping this in mind, pepper spray and

136
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
mass detention were also reported.

137
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,000
Along with this, Chicago in fact, if I

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,560
show you this entire map, if you see it, then in

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
fact what happens in almost every city of the US, not only this, but

140
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,120
most of the cities, if you

141
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,720
look at the states, they belong to the Democratic Party.

142
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,280

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,520
Saying Democratic Party means that for a long time they have been

144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,840
choosing the Democratic Party.

145
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
They mostly vote for him.  So

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,440
you will mostly

147
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,360
see this entire protest in those cities and states only.  For

148
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
example, if you look from here, there is Seattle

149
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
, San Francisco, especially

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,479
California, this entire state of

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
California, there are many cities here.  There's Los

152
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,800
Angeles, there's Santana, there's San Francisco.  A

153
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,479
protest was going on here on a large scale.

154
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,759
Apart from this,

155
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,160
this entire protest started on the Eastern Side also.   There's

156
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
Boston, there's New York City, there's Washington

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,520
, there's Atlanta, down on the Southern Side there's

158
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,520
Dallas, Houston, San Antonio.  So

159
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,280

160
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,800
you are seeing such protests in many such cities including Chicago.

161
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,960
And people were protesting in different ways.

162
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,639
But here, if

163
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,759
you see, while protesting, the

164
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,720
protesters

165
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,400
also started burning the American flag, which is the US flag.  There are

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,120
many cities here, like

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, where the

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,960
federal buildings, that is, the

169
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
buildings related to the central government,

170
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,120

171
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,280
they first started taking down the flags that were hoisted there.

172
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
After that, videos and images started coming out

173
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,360
where you can see how the

174
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
American flag was being burnt

175
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,199
and their demand was to

176
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,840

177
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,240
abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  No Human is Illegal

178
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,919
Shame on America.  They were raising slogans like this.

179
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,919
But specifically the news that came here was

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,600
from Seattle.  Again, let me show you the map.

181
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,520

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,400
If you look at the upper North Western side, this is

183
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,319
Seattle.  So it was told there that

184
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,319
this happened from morning till yesterday.

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,520
From early morning

186
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,039
people started gathering at the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building.

187
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,199

188
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
Started doing demonstrations.  Then in the evening,

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,600
around 9:30 pm, it is being said that the

190
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,720
protesters removed the US flag

191
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,039
from the building and set it on fire.

192
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Then after 15 minutes it was revealed that the second

193
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,280
US flag was also taken down and set on

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
fire

195
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,440
by the protesters.  So, somewhere or the other, you will witness this very emotional

196
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
peak during the entire demonstration.

197
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,479
Well, the question here is,

198
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,800

199
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,039
to what extent is flag burning allowed in America?

200
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
Because obviously, in India and many such

201
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,280
countries, you cannot even imagine this.   I

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,880
mean it's an obvious thing how

203
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,120
can you burn the flag.  You have to protest,

204
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,599
do it up to a certain level.  So that thing is allowed.

205
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,000
But if you look in America, flag

206
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,880
burning in the US is

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,039
constitutionally protected free speech

208
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,639
under the First Amendment.  So under the

209
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,919
First Amendment of the US Constitution,

210
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,319
flag burning is

211
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,720
considered as free speech.  Meaning it

212
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,720
is protected under free speech.

213
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,120
No one will harm you.  The court will not send you to jail

214
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,000
because you burnt the American flag.

215
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,240
And this was also accepted by the Supreme Court

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,560
here in the entire case of Texas versus Johnson which took place in 1989.  So

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,479
even though this is legal in America,

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,319
you can show it as a protest.   You

220
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,319
can burn the flag.  But

221
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,800
obviously this is very controversial and

222
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,759
emotionally charged.  Especially for those people who are

223
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,000
very patriotic

224
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,919
about America, the vets, the army personnel,

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,400
they don't like this thing.  But what the

226
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,720
protesters are burning in a way

227
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,160
symbolises that they are rejecting the crackdown being carried out by the state.

228
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280

229
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,440

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,280

231
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,919
They are protesting against the authoritarianism being adopted by Trump.

232
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,919
And they are

233
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,400
showing solidarity with undocumented immigrants and saying that in

234
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,639

235
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
a way we want to stop Trump era nationalism.  So

236
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
he is in a way symbolizing that

237
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,919
through flag burning we are

238
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
not against America.  But here in the

239
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,640
state, we are against Trump.  Well,

240
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,560
here the question arises about legal and political

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,399
dimensions.  Look, if you

242
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,720
look at it from the Constitution's perspective, here

243
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,880
in America, the special states have a lot of power.

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Wherever this crackdown has been done, the

245
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,440
states have

246
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,000
invoked the 10th Amendment and said that

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,399
under this amendment we are

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,720
not obligated to accept the federal immigration losses.   It is

249
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,640
not necessary that we enforce it.

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,640
But on the other hand, the Trump Administration

251
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,600
cites the Supremacy Clause.   She

252
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,240
says that no, according to this clause,

253
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
our power is dominant in your state.

254
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,680
So see, most

255
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,440
likely this entire matter will now

256
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
go to the Supreme Court of America and it will be

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,640
heard there and it will be decided

258
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,279
who has more power because

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,200
there you will get to see something like true federalism,

260
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
in America the states have a

261
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,839
lot of power, not like in India, here in

262
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,000
India there is more inclination of power towards the centre,

263
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
if you see, so specifically let

264
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,760
me tell you about the century cities, there are

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,440
many cities in America

266
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
which are called century cities and this is

267
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
coming in the news a lot, so century cities

268
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,519
are those cities like Los Angeles,

269
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,320
New York, San Francisco, what they do is that they

270
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,640

271
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720

272
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,720
reject the laws of the federal government of America related to immigration.  And that

273
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,959
is why most of the immigrants

274
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,200
go there.  Let's

275
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
go inside these cities.  And those cities say, the

276
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880
mayors there say that local autonomy

277
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,640
matters more to us.

278
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,360
We focus more on community trust

279
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,440
rather than immigration status.

280
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
So the federal government is threatening

281
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
that if you do this then we will

282
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,560
stop your funding etc.  So

283
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,560
you will get to see this kind of thing.  Is there a good

284
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
political reaction coming?

285
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,519
This statement has been given by Trump.  He says

286
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,839
he defends ICE's operations

287
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,600
and upholds the rule of law.

288
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,160
He says that in the century

289
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,320
cities like New York and Los Angeles,

290
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,079
there are lots of criminals.  So this is a

291
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
threat to national security.   In

292
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,399
fact, 70% of the people we detained have a

293
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,480
previous

294
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,640
criminal record.  So that is why it

295
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
is necessary to remove them.  On the other hand, there are

296
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,160
Democratic governors and mayors, whether it is the

297
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,399
governor of California or the mayor of New York.

298
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,640
So he said that he has condemned the

299
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,720
entire rate and said that

300
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,880
this is a kind of federal overreach

301
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,040
and terror tactics are being adopted against immigrants.  The

302
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,880
things that you

303
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,720
use against terror and terrorism, you are

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
using the same against them, which is not right.  So

305
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,880
they ultimately said that we will take action against this

306
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,800
and will

307
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,480
file a case in the US Supreme Court.  So we will

308
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
have to see what happens in that.  But let me

309
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,399
also give you a little historical context.

310
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,640
This is not the first time you are

311
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,560
seeing such a protest.

312
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,519
In 2018, when Donald Trump was in power, he had

313
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,680
implemented a zero tolerance policy and at the US-

314
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,160
Mexico border, there were thousands of

315
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,720
children who were separated from their parents.  A

316
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,720
raid was also conducted in Mississippi in 2019.

317
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,040
More than 600 people were

318
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,279
arrested simultaneously.  The largest single

319
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,600
state immigration raid was conducted.  In fact,

320
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,640
even if you look at the time of Barack Obama,

321
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,360
around 2.5 million people were

322
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,360
deported.  But at that time it was said

323
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,320
that the deportation was basically

324
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,640
focused on felons and not on families.  I

325
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,480
mean felons, I mean people who were

326
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
involved in serious crimes, have committed murders and

327
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
such things.  So we are deporting them and

328
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
not their families.  So you will

329
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
get to see this historical context.

330
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,240
Now let's see in which direction America

331
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,079
goes from here.  What happens in America and

332
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,480
how are protests ultimately stopped

333
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,839
?  A lot is going to happen.  Look and

334
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,600
before you go I have a very interesting question for all of you.

335
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
Can you tell

336
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,120
which of these features will be

337
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,440
found in the Indian Constitution but is

338
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,680

339
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,880
not explicitly mentioned in the US Constitution?  I have to tell you this.  This

340
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
is a very interesting question.

341
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,079

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,279
