Friends, the condition of America at this time is such that there is hardly any corner left in the country where rights and protests are not being seen on a large scale. Because of the way Donald Trump tried to impose the immigration policy. Due to this, protests are taking place on a large scale. In big cities.  You can see this news: Protests spread across US despite Trump threats.  So, let us understand this in a bit of detail.  In fact, news is also coming that American flags have also been burnt in some cities. Well, let me tell you here that some other things are said about the flag in India. If you look in America, there are some different laws regarding the flag.  I will tell you that in the video.  Let's move on. But before that friends, let me tell you all that Study IQ's Great Learning Festival is going on at this time.  Under which you can avail extra discount on our pledge batch.  And this is special because as soon as you clear the prelims, your entire fee is refunded. Preparation is done for everything: prelims, mains and interview.  All you have to do is use this code AnkitLive so that you can get maximum discount and its link is given in the comment section.  Let's get started.  As you must be seeing, for the past few days, news is coming from America continuously, especially in Los Angeles, you must have seen that protests are happening on a large scale here because the federal department in Donald Trump's administration, you must be hearing often about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a large scale raid was carried out by them in Los Angeles, due to which continuous protests were happening, raids were happening and vehicles were also being burnt at many places, such scenes were coming to the fore and seeing this, finally Donald Trump also deployed the military and because of this, its effect is being seen in the surrounding states and different cities of America and people are protesting on a large scale. Along with this, it is also being told that people have clashed with the police. 100s of people are being arrested. Chemical irritants are being used by the police and the military to disperse the crowd. Well, what is the reason behind all this? What is a trigger?  I will tell you that quickly. Look, this current wave of protests that is going on right now, it is mainly because Donald Trump's administration's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICU) started a crackdown, especially in Los Angeles. The Department of Homeland Security there instructed that no person who is undocumented and has a past record should be spared. Basically, efforts were being made to deport them. And that is why, if you see, continuous raids were started here since early morning last week and raids were being conducted by the federal department in many immigrant-heavy areas.  Keep in mind that when I say Federal Department, just like in India we call it Centre, or Central Government, in the same way the Trump Administration is also called Central Government. Apart from this, families were also being detained.  The children were also being included in this.  Those who were residents in America for a very long time were also being arrested.  Then along with this, militarization was also used. And somewhere this made people even more angry.  Apart from this, attempts were being made to deport people without any legal council.  At the same time, reports were coming that racial profiling was being done here, meaning that if you belonged to this particular race then you were being specifically targeted here. For example, Latinos, Muslims, South Asians, Africans were all being specifically targeted.  And that became the trigger point due to which you got to see this entire protest.   In fact, the matter escalated when Donald Trump first used the National Guard , used the military, and what's more, Donald Trump did this: the US Marines, that is, the elite force that operates in foreign countries, it is very rare that you are used for domestic purposes. So the US Marines were also called inside Los Angeles.  In fact, the Governor of California even said that you were seeing things like democracy under assault. And that is why you will see this wide spread outrage in many cities. And what are the major hotspots?  One thing is Los Angeles, where this whole thing started, that still exists.  Apart from this, in fact, if you look in Los Angeles, such scenes were coming to the fore. People were protesting.  In fact, there was also New York City where tens of thousands of people began gathering at Times Square in Brooklyn.  The protesters had started climbing the federal building. And keeping this in mind, pepper spray and mass detention were also reported. Along with this, Chicago in fact, if I show you this entire map, if you see it, then in fact what happens in almost every city of the US, not only this, but most of the cities, if you look at the states, they belong to the Democratic Party. Saying Democratic Party means that for a long time they have been choosing the Democratic Party. They mostly vote for him.  So you will mostly see this entire protest in those cities and states only.  For example, if you look from here, there is Seattle , San Francisco, especially California, this entire state of California, there are many cities here.  There's Los Angeles, there's Santana, there's San Francisco.  A protest was going on here on a large scale. Apart from this, this entire protest started on the Eastern Side also.   There's Boston, there's New York City, there's Washington , there's Atlanta, down on the Southern Side there's Dallas, Houston, San Antonio.  So you are seeing such protests in many such cities including Chicago. And people were protesting in different ways. But here, if you see, while protesting, the protesters also started burning the American flag, which is the US flag.  There are many cities here, like Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, where the federal buildings, that is, the buildings related to the central government, they first started taking down the flags that were hoisted there. After that, videos and images started coming out where you can see how the American flag was being burnt and their demand was to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  No Human is Illegal Shame on America.  They were raising slogans like this. But specifically the news that came here was from Seattle.  Again, let me show you the map. If you look at the upper North Western side, this is Seattle.  So it was told there that this happened from morning till yesterday. From early morning people started gathering at the Henry M. Jackson Federal Building. Started doing demonstrations.  Then in the evening, around 9:30 pm, it is being said that the protesters removed the US flag from the building and set it on fire. Then after 15 minutes it was revealed that the second US flag was also taken down and set on fire by the protesters.  So, somewhere or the other, you will witness this very emotional peak during the entire demonstration. Well, the question here is, to what extent is flag burning allowed in America? Because obviously, in India and many such countries, you cannot even imagine this.   I mean it's an obvious thing how can you burn the flag.  You have to protest, do it up to a certain level.  So that thing is allowed. But if you look in America, flag burning in the US is constitutionally protected free speech under the First Amendment.  So under the First Amendment of the US Constitution, flag burning is considered as free speech.  Meaning it is protected under free speech. No one will harm you.  The court will not send you to jail because you burnt the American flag. And this was also accepted by the Supreme Court here in the entire case of Texas versus Johnson which took place in 1989.  So even though this is legal in America, you can show it as a protest.   You can burn the flag.  But obviously this is very controversial and emotionally charged.  Especially for those people who are very patriotic about America, the vets, the army personnel, they don't like this thing.  But what the protesters are burning in a way symbolises that they are rejecting the crackdown being carried out by the state. They are protesting against the authoritarianism being adopted by Trump. And they are showing solidarity with undocumented immigrants and saying that in a way we want to stop Trump era nationalism.  So he is in a way symbolizing that through flag burning we are not against America.  But here in the state, we are against Trump.  Well, here the question arises about legal and political dimensions.  Look, if you look at it from the Constitution's perspective, here in America, the special states have a lot of power. Wherever this crackdown has been done, the states have invoked the 10th Amendment and said that under this amendment we are not obligated to accept the federal immigration losses.   It is not necessary that we enforce it. But on the other hand, the Trump Administration cites the Supremacy Clause.   She says that no, according to this clause, our power is dominant in your state. So see, most likely this entire matter will now go to the Supreme Court of America and it will be heard there and it will be decided who has more power because there you will get to see something like true federalism, in America the states have a lot of power, not like in India, here in India there is more inclination of power towards the centre, if you see, so specifically let me tell you about the century cities, there are many cities in America which are called century cities and this is coming in the news a lot, so century cities are those cities like Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, what they do is that they reject the laws of the federal government of America related to immigration.  And that is why most of the immigrants go there.  Let's go inside these cities.  And those cities say, the mayors there say that local autonomy matters more to us. We focus more on community trust rather than immigration status. So the federal government is threatening that if you do this then we will stop your funding etc.  So you will get to see this kind of thing.  Is there a good political reaction coming? This statement has been given by Trump.  He says he defends ICE's operations and upholds the rule of law. He says that in the century cities like New York and Los Angeles, there are lots of criminals.  So this is a threat to national security.   In fact, 70% of the people we detained have a previous criminal record.  So that is why it is necessary to remove them.  On the other hand, there are Democratic governors and mayors, whether it is the governor of California or the mayor of New York. So he said that he has condemned the entire rate and said that this is a kind of federal overreach and terror tactics are being adopted against immigrants.  The things that you use against terror and terrorism, you are using the same against them, which is not right.  So they ultimately said that we will take action against this and will file a case in the US Supreme Court.  So we will have to see what happens in that.  But let me also give you a little historical context. This is not the first time you are seeing such a protest. In 2018, when Donald Trump was in power, he had implemented a zero tolerance policy and at the US- Mexico border, there were thousands of children who were separated from their parents.  A raid was also conducted in Mississippi in 2019. More than 600 people were arrested simultaneously.  The largest single state immigration raid was conducted.  In fact, even if you look at the time of Barack Obama, around 2.5 million people were deported.  But at that time it was said that the deportation was basically focused on felons and not on families.  I mean felons, I mean people who were involved in serious crimes, have committed murders and such things.  So we are deporting them and not their families.  So you will get to see this historical context. Now let's see in which direction America goes from here.  What happens in America and how are protests ultimately stopped ?  A lot is going to happen.  Look and before you go I have a very interesting question for all of you. Can you tell which of these features will be found in the Indian Constitution but is not explicitly mentioned in the US Constitution?  I have to tell you this.  This is a very interesting question.
