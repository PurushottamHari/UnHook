1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,200
Welcome to Study Close.  So

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,040
friends, in what way has Pakistan

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,880
betrayed Iran?  Let's talk.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,520
But the combo of Personality Development plus Chanakya

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,000
Niti, this lecture, i.e. this

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,840
course, the link of the description is given in the comment box.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,359
You can cancel this course.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,840
We have launched an offer for one day.

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,560
This course costs only ₹500.  Use coupon code SUMMER.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,200
So look friend,

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,719
Iran will take 110% revenge for whatever Pakistan did.  Is it

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,600
a balancing act?  Now Pakistan is

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,480
becoming India, okay it's okay.  We will take help from America as well

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,360
as from China and the

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,760
work will be done.  But friends, it is

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,840
not working like this because the real

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,199
war is going on at this time.  This is not a proxy war

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,360
that Pakistan can escape by taking a narrow path.

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,719
Now they have given strong rhetorical support

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,600
to Iran that no, no, we are

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,239
with you.  Shabaz Sharif had said that you should

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,159
say that we did not carry out the Palgaon attack

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,320
and we will also give you nuclear missiles.

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,479
And when one of his IRGC

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,799
members spoke about this, he backed off and changed the party.

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,920
So whatever rules this civilized

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,200
behavior and international humanitarian law

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,759
says, he is valeting them all.  So, in a

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,000
way, Israel is making a big mess.   He is

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,240
doing something very wrong.  But during the same time, Asim

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,960
Munir has lunch with Donald Trump.

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
Scratch the chicken.  So basically what

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,799
you are seeing, this double standard, this

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,840
duplicity is what Pakistan has been

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:41,200
doing since always.  Now Iran will remember this betrayal.

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,799
Ok?  Ishqdar, their Foreign

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
Minister immediately said that no

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,720
such statement has

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,320
come from our side.  Immediately means without even thinking for a second.

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,880

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,560
So brother, now Asim Munir has

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,040
gone and sat right in the lap of America

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
and Iran can see this clearly.  By the way, let

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,320
me tell you that Iran has opened its airspace for India for

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
some time because thousands of

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,799
more students are to be evacuated.

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,840
So this balancing act is going to be so

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,239
dangerous.  Let's talk.

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
First of all, you know that the

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,840
relationship between Pakistan and Iran is quite

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
complex.  You can see it, this

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,040
shaded area is called entire

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,360
Balochistan and the Baloch say

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
that the entire area is ours.  Now this is

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,520
Balochistan of Pakistan where Balochistan Liberation

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
Army is there, this is Jaish al Adl, this is Shistan

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Balochistan.  This is an area of ​​Iran.  You may

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,519
remember that

61
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,080
last year both countries

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,920
fired missiles at each other.  Both Iran and Pakistan

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
clashed with each other.  And since then the relationship had become

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
very bad.  Now that is a lie

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
that no, the relationships are good.

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
But the terrorists here

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
attack here and the terrorists here, that is the

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,680
militants, attack here.

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,840
So both of them keep blaming each other

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
that what you have is

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
making ours unstable and what yours has is making ours

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
unstable.  But the truth is

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,000
friends that they want a whole United

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Balochistan and if Iran goes then

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
you can assume that this area will be

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,360
occupied by Jaish-e-Mohammed and after that

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,440
Pakistan's Balochistan will be in danger.

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
So the relationship which is between the two Islamic countries and the

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,040
Islamic Republic,

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,440
I will tell you

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,840
what Iran has done for Pakistan and okay

82
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
friends you will reap what you sow

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,599
but we also supported Iran in 1979

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
because

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,840
see Pakistan had begged from everyone, so Pakistan

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
knew that we would not be able to do anything on our own, so

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
we immediately

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,680
chose America and said that we will go with America.

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,239
India remained non-aligned but Pakistan

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,799
immediately chose the US.  Now

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
because Iran was also a stooge of America at that time.

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,360
Iran did whatever America said.

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
Reza Shah Pahlavi was the one who was

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,080
put in power by America.  So it is obvious that

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Pakistan will definitely support Iran

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
and Iran will do everything that makes

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,840
both Pakistan and America happy.   The

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,280
location of Pakistan is very strategic.

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,239
That's why every country needs that country.  So what

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,080
happened now is that Iran became the first country to

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,640
immediately recognise Pakistan

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
in 1947.  Nothing happens by creating a country.   On

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,360
the other hand, Nityananda is also roaming around the country.

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,360
You can also make your own country but unless you get recognition, it makes

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,400
no sense.

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Taiwan is so developed but it has

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
not yet received recognition.  Are you understanding?  The

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,799
day I got recognition.  Countries have started

109
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,199
recognizing and now recognition means

110
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,520
membership of the United Nations.  Then the

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,840
embassy had to be opened and many other relations were also

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,360
established.  So unless that

113
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,440
happens, no country gets recognised.

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
So Iran immediately said that yes, we

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,120
recognize you in 1947 and

116
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
Pakistan still has

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,120
very bad relations with Israel.  Has not been recognised.

118
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,560
In those 1965 and 1971 wars, Iran

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,639
gave full support to Pakistan and

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
why not, brother?

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,680
America completely supported whatever it said.

122
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
America was preparing to launch a nuclear attack on India.

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280

125
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
Brother, we had signed a friendship treaty with the USSR enterprise and

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
they

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,680
sent their war fleet.  900 Km  This

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,160
is the border, friends.  Which is of Iran and Pakistan's

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,320
Balochistan.  Do you understand?  And

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,280
so far there have been 15 border clashes in the last 10

131
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,160
years.  And then Iran and

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,039
Pakistan, historically they have been

133
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,160
deferred regarding Afghanistan.  Now Iran

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,880
is a Shia majority country.  Now when the Taliban

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,400
came and when the Taliban was fighting, when there was civil

136
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,080
war in Afghanistan from 1991 to 1996, the

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,840
Taliban would always be

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,080
against the Shias.  We also get to see the persecution of Shia.

139
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,759
Iran supports the

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,199
Northern Alliance which

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,000
fights against the Taliban.  Anti-Taliban

142
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,680
forces.  From here the relations between both Pakistan and Iran

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
started to crack.

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,360
Because Pakistan was supporting the Taliban.

145
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,080
After that, the

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,560
relationship that Pakistan has with Saudi Arabia is that

147
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,960
all the Sunni madrasas and the network are

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,320
funded by Saudi Arabia, somewhere or the other.

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
Does Saudi Arabia

150
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,240
fund him somewhere?  So the Sunni sectarian

151
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,960
groups in Pakistan

152
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,360
study in these madrasas and persecute the Shia minority.  Are

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,280

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
you understanding?  So it has been a very complex relationship.

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,600
But definitely Iran does

156
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,600
not consider Pakistan a very good friend.  Ok.

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Now you will say, Sir, his support is visible.  It is

158
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,840
definitely visible because Pakistan has

159
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,840
promised everyone that our

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
nuclear bomb is a Muslim bomb.  If there is

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,440
any problem we will come.  But friends,

162
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,759
this doesn't belong to anyone.  These are only worth America's

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,680
money.  They will come for money.  Now if

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,039
we talk about the American angle, then the

165
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,520
condition of Iran after America in 1979.  Is it

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,520
okay?  Which is their military and

167
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,479
financial dependency on Washington,

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,639
especially of Pakistan.  So that is the current

169
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,280
situation because Pakistan knows that it

170
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,039
is on the verge of economic collapse and if

171
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,800
America does not support us then

172
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,199
we are going to be finished.  Right?  After 91,

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,680
Pakistan had a very big base.

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,600
All the airplanes and

175
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,600
fighter jets of the American military used to fly from Pakistan

176
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
and they also raised the Mujahideen.

177
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,520
Well, everybody knows that.

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,759
Under Operation Cyclone,

179
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,880
they get billions and billions of dollars.

180
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,840
So in a way America also has

181
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,840
reliance on them.  Let me tell you this as well.  America

182
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,599
also knows that if we have to control this region of

183
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,520
West Asia, then either

184
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,360
we need the support of Afghanistan or we

185
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
need the support of Pakistan.

186
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
We want one of these two countries.  India will

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,000
never give away its airbase.  India itself is

188
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,759
a very powerful country.  What to do?  So,

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,800
in 2011-91, that is to say, the attacks of 2000 and September 11, 2001,

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,960
America welcomed them.

191
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,720
In 2021, Neto pulled out.  That

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,759
means all the NATO forces have

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,400
left.  Now Afghanistan's war on terror is

194
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,039
over.  Then the Pakistan band

195
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,800
started playing.  And if you see, during that time

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,120
Pakistan had also done ceasefire with India.

197
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,280
China-centric Indo-Pacific

198
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,440
objectives became

199
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,360
increasingly important for Pakistan.  In fact friends,

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,960
when Joe Biden came, now you will call him useless,

201
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,280
but brother Donald Trump was

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,199
very right, in his last

203
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,360
tenure of four years, he did

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,280
not meet even one Pakistani leader and kept

205
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,639
his relations at the lowest level.

206
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,360
Pakistan also came to FATF.  Now Iran is

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,840
in danger at this time and Pakistan has

208
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,759
not fulfilled the promise it made.

209
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,240
Nothing happens with retolic support.

210
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,680
Asim Munir is such a crazy man that after going to America, he is

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
saying that we will

212
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,120
give whatever support to Iran.  He

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,599
condemns Israel and is sitting there eating lunch.

214
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,879
Friends, let me tell you that these

215
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,800
spy planes have been

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,360
given shelter by Pakistan.  Pakistan has

217
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
given its airspace to American planes and is

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,839
saying that we will help Iran.  So

219
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,479
forget it, it's never going to happen.  Are

220
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
you understanding?  Trump is now telling the Pakistanis

221
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
that Pakistanis

222
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,120
know a lot about Iran.  I know everything about them.

223
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,440
Right?

224
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,279
Well, what should India do?  Look, the

225
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,360
view point of India is that the first thing that

226
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,680
India has said about isolating Pakistan should be done

227
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,760
diplomatically.  The

228
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
manner in which America has shown bragging after Operation Sindoor has been

229
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,839

230
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,440
completely discredited by India saying that it is nonsense.

231
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
We did not say anything like that.  Is it okay

232
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
?  This Don Trump is like that and

233
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,680
Narendra Modi told him straight on his face.   In

234
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,480
fact, he even rejected the invitation.

235
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,399
So Pakistan will always do this through American mediation

236
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,320
and

237
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,839
it has even nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Why did you nominate?  Because he knows

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,480
that we won't be able to do it.  We

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,000
cannot kill India on our own.  It will become very difficult.

241
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,920
We need four to five countries that can at

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,480
least counter India, and anyway,

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,519
forget about the military side, do it diplomatically.  Ok

244
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,279
?  Iran has been a very important element in

245
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
India's strategy.  Ok?

246
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,880
See, even now he gave us space.

247
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,320
Now whatever regime comes there, we have had

248
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,320
very good relations and we have been

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,720
buying oil from Iran.  There are cultural ties.

250
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
And we have made investments and India has

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,399
also told Israel

252
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,519
not to attack Chabarhar Port.

253
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,200
After our IASTC, we had to make the IAC.

254
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,200
Ok?  The Indian Middle East Economic

255
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,360
Corridor was going to pass through Gwadar.  Well,

256
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,320
that has been put on the back burner.  So

257
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,320
Pakistan has reasons that at this time

258
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,800
we have a huge opportunity to

259
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,120
separate Tehran from New Delhi.  But

260
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,160
this is not happening because you are supporting and

261
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
just showing it but you know, well

262
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,640
New Delhi can catch this very well.

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
India can say what it is

264
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,800
and can tell this to Iran.  See

265
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,600
who is your real friend?  Your real brother

266
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,200
China, at least, is coming forward in Iran and saying

267
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,200
yes, we are with you.  So

268
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,360
this India can definitely do leverage

269
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,680
and after that preemptive strikes have

270
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,839
happened.  Pakistan says that the Israeli

271
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,160
actions are very wrong and

272
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,720
should not happen. And if we talk about Pakistan, then the

273
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,079
actions are in

274
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,640
a way a protocol so that

275
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,560
India can also act in this manner in the future.

276
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,720
That is why Pakistan is condemning Israel.

277
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,399
Right?  Because brother, Pakistan was afraid

278
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,560
that India might

279
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,519
blow up its nuclear site and I think that maybe

280
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,079
work might be going on in this too.  So this

281
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,880
is the accounting.  If this is their balancing act then it is fine.

282
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,440
That let's do a balancing act.

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
But this did not work.  And let me tell you another thing

284
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,200
that Pakistan is very boastful that

285
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,040
we have got the nuclear bomb. Do you think

286
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
their minister says that

287
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,519
why have we kept Shaheen and these missiles?

288
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
Shaheen Shah Faridi Missile I am joking.

289
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,920
We have kept it for India but they are

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
very afraid that any day India and Israel

291
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
together may destroy our nuclear

292
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,360
program.

293
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,680
So the conclusion is that Pakistan is in danger.

294
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
