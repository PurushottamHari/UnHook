I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Close.  So friends, in what way has Pakistan betrayed Iran?  Let's talk. But the combo of Personality Development plus Chanakya Niti, this lecture, i.e. this course, the link of the description is given in the comment box. You can cancel this course. We have launched an offer for one day. This course costs only ₹500.  Use coupon code SUMMER. So look friend, Iran will take 110% revenge for whatever Pakistan did.  Is it a balancing act?  Now Pakistan is becoming India, okay it's okay.  We will take help from America as well as from China and the work will be done.  But friends, it is not working like this because the real war is going on at this time.  This is not a proxy war that Pakistan can escape by taking a narrow path. Now they have given strong rhetorical support to Iran that no, no, we are with you.  Shabaz Sharif had said that you should say that we did not carry out the Palgaon attack and we will also give you nuclear missiles. And when one of his IRGC members spoke about this, he backed off and changed the party. So whatever rules this civilized behavior and international humanitarian law says, he is valeting them all.  So, in a way, Israel is making a big mess.   He is doing something very wrong.  But during the same time, Asim Munir has lunch with Donald Trump. Scratch the chicken.  So basically what you are seeing, this double standard, this duplicity is what Pakistan has been doing since always.  Now Iran will remember this betrayal. Ok?  Ishqdar, their Foreign Minister immediately said that no such statement has come from our side.  Immediately means without even thinking for a second. So brother, now Asim Munir has gone and sat right in the lap of America and Iran can see this clearly.  By the way, let me tell you that Iran has opened its airspace for India for some time because thousands of more students are to be evacuated. So this balancing act is going to be so dangerous.  Let's talk. First of all, you know that the relationship between Pakistan and Iran is quite complex.  You can see it, this shaded area is called entire Balochistan and the Baloch say that the entire area is ours.  Now this is Balochistan of Pakistan where Balochistan Liberation Army is there, this is Jaish al Adl, this is Shistan Balochistan.  This is an area of ​​Iran.  You may remember that last year both countries fired missiles at each other.  Both Iran and Pakistan clashed with each other.  And since then the relationship had become very bad.  Now that is a lie that no, the relationships are good. But the terrorists here attack here and the terrorists here, that is the militants, attack here. So both of them keep blaming each other that what you have is making ours unstable and what yours has is making ours unstable.  But the truth is friends that they want a whole United Balochistan and if Iran goes then you can assume that this area will be occupied by Jaish-e-Mohammed and after that Pakistan's Balochistan will be in danger. So the relationship which is between the two Islamic countries and the Islamic Republic, I will tell you what Iran has done for Pakistan and okay friends you will reap what you sow but we also supported Iran in 1979 because see Pakistan had begged from everyone, so Pakistan knew that we would not be able to do anything on our own, so we immediately chose America and said that we will go with America. India remained non-aligned but Pakistan immediately chose the US.  Now because Iran was also a stooge of America at that time. Iran did whatever America said. Reza Shah Pahlavi was the one who was put in power by America.  So it is obvious that Pakistan will definitely support Iran and Iran will do everything that makes both Pakistan and America happy.   The location of Pakistan is very strategic. That's why every country needs that country.  So what happened now is that Iran became the first country to immediately recognise Pakistan in 1947.  Nothing happens by creating a country.   On the other hand, Nityananda is also roaming around the country. You can also make your own country but unless you get recognition, it makes no sense. Taiwan is so developed but it has not yet received recognition.  Are you understanding?  The day I got recognition.  Countries have started recognizing and now recognition means membership of the United Nations.  Then the embassy had to be opened and many other relations were also established.  So unless that happens, no country gets recognised. So Iran immediately said that yes, we recognize you in 1947 and Pakistan still has very bad relations with Israel.  Has not been recognised. In those 1965 and 1971 wars, Iran gave full support to Pakistan and why not, brother? America completely supported whatever it said. America was preparing to launch a nuclear attack on India. Brother, we had signed a friendship treaty with the USSR enterprise and they sent their war fleet.  900 Km  This is the border, friends.  Which is of Iran and Pakistan's Balochistan.  Do you understand?  And so far there have been 15 border clashes in the last 10 years.  And then Iran and Pakistan, historically they have been deferred regarding Afghanistan.  Now Iran is a Shia majority country.  Now when the Taliban came and when the Taliban was fighting, when there was civil war in Afghanistan from 1991 to 1996, the Taliban would always be against the Shias.  We also get to see the persecution of Shia. Iran supports the Northern Alliance which fights against the Taliban.  Anti-Taliban forces.  From here the relations between both Pakistan and Iran started to crack. Because Pakistan was supporting the Taliban. After that, the relationship that Pakistan has with Saudi Arabia is that all the Sunni madrasas and the network are funded by Saudi Arabia, somewhere or the other. Does Saudi Arabia fund him somewhere?  So the Sunni sectarian groups in Pakistan study in these madrasas and persecute the Shia minority.  Are you understanding?  So it has been a very complex relationship. But definitely Iran does not consider Pakistan a very good friend.  Ok. Now you will say, Sir, his support is visible.  It is definitely visible because Pakistan has promised everyone that our nuclear bomb is a Muslim bomb.  If there is any problem we will come.  But friends, this doesn't belong to anyone.  These are only worth America's money.  They will come for money.  Now if we talk about the American angle, then the condition of Iran after America in 1979.  Is it okay?  Which is their military and financial dependency on Washington, especially of Pakistan.  So that is the current situation because Pakistan knows that it is on the verge of economic collapse and if America does not support us then we are going to be finished.  Right?  After 91, Pakistan had a very big base. All the airplanes and fighter jets of the American military used to fly from Pakistan and they also raised the Mujahideen. Well, everybody knows that. Under Operation Cyclone, they get billions and billions of dollars. So in a way America also has reliance on them.  Let me tell you this as well.  America also knows that if we have to control this region of West Asia, then either we need the support of Afghanistan or we need the support of Pakistan. We want one of these two countries.  India will never give away its airbase.  India itself is a very powerful country.  What to do?  So, in 2011-91, that is to say, the attacks of 2000 and September 11, 2001, America welcomed them. In 2021, Neto pulled out.  That means all the NATO forces have left.  Now Afghanistan's war on terror is over.  Then the Pakistan band started playing.  And if you see, during that time Pakistan had also done ceasefire with India. China-centric Indo-Pacific objectives became increasingly important for Pakistan.  In fact friends, when Joe Biden came, now you will call him useless, but brother Donald Trump was very right, in his last tenure of four years, he did not meet even one Pakistani leader and kept his relations at the lowest level. Pakistan also came to FATF.  Now Iran is in danger at this time and Pakistan has not fulfilled the promise it made. Nothing happens with retolic support. Asim Munir is such a crazy man that after going to America, he is saying that we will give whatever support to Iran.  He condemns Israel and is sitting there eating lunch. Friends, let me tell you that these spy planes have been given shelter by Pakistan.  Pakistan has given its airspace to American planes and is saying that we will help Iran.  So forget it, it's never going to happen.  Are you understanding?  Trump is now telling the Pakistanis that Pakistanis know a lot about Iran.  I know everything about them. Right? Well, what should India do?  Look, the view point of India is that the first thing that India has said about isolating Pakistan should be done diplomatically.  The manner in which America has shown bragging after Operation Sindoor has been completely discredited by India saying that it is nonsense. We did not say anything like that.  Is it okay ?  This Don Trump is like that and Narendra Modi told him straight on his face.   In fact, he even rejected the invitation. So Pakistan will always do this through American mediation and it has even nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Why did you nominate?  Because he knows that we won't be able to do it.  We cannot kill India on our own.  It will become very difficult. We need four to five countries that can at least counter India, and anyway, forget about the military side, do it diplomatically.  Ok ?  Iran has been a very important element in India's strategy.  Ok? See, even now he gave us space. Now whatever regime comes there, we have had very good relations and we have been buying oil from Iran.  There are cultural ties. And we have made investments and India has also told Israel not to attack Chabarhar Port. After our IASTC, we had to make the IAC. Ok?  The Indian Middle East Economic Corridor was going to pass through Gwadar.  Well, that has been put on the back burner.  So Pakistan has reasons that at this time we have a huge opportunity to separate Tehran from New Delhi.  But this is not happening because you are supporting and just showing it but you know, well New Delhi can catch this very well. India can say what it is and can tell this to Iran.  See who is your real friend?  Your real brother China, at least, is coming forward in Iran and saying yes, we are with you.  So this India can definitely do leverage and after that preemptive strikes have happened.  Pakistan says that the Israeli actions are very wrong and should not happen. And if we talk about Pakistan, then the actions are in a way a protocol so that India can also act in this manner in the future. That is why Pakistan is condemning Israel. Right?  Because brother, Pakistan was afraid that India might blow up its nuclear site and I think that maybe work might be going on in this too.  So this is the accounting.  If this is their balancing act then it is fine. That let's do a balancing act. But this did not work.  And let me tell you another thing that Pakistan is very boastful that we have got the nuclear bomb. Do you think their minister says that why have we kept Shaheen and these missiles? Shaheen Shah Faridi Missile I am joking. We have kept it for India but they are very afraid that any day India and Israel together may destroy our nuclear program. So the conclusion is that Pakistan is in danger.
