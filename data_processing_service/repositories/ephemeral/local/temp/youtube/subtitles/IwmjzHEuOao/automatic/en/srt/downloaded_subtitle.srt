1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,440
Hello Friends.  Friends, finally the thing that

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,840
many people were waiting for

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,920
in India has been announced.  The Ministry of

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,040
Road Transport has announced how the

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,120
annual pass for Fast Tag will be

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,879
implemented and how you can get it.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Keep this in mind, let me tell you one thing.

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,079
Earlier there was another talk that

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,760
lifetime pass, meaning the pass for 15 years, will

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,680
also be announced.  But it has been

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,199
rejected now.  Right now, there is only

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,719
annual pass, which means you can get the pass on yearly basis

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,920
and you can see in this news,

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,840
Nitin Gadkari announces tag annual pass.  So there

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,159
is a need to understand this in a little detail,

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
what is this thing?  Meaning,

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,640
what charges will be levied under this pass?  How many trips will

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,640
you be able to make?  What is the criticism regarding this

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,400
?  And how will the number of trips be counted

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,560
?  I will tell you all that in detail.

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
Let's move on.  Look,

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
first of all the question here is

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,960
what is this Fast Tag based annual toll pass

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
?  It's a simple thing.  You will see today's date,

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,680
I am sure that all your vehicles will have

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
Fast Tag.  That means, as

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,759
you all know, there is a fast tag installed on the windshield of the vehicle

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,079
and whenever you

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,320
cross a toll, money is automatically deducted from your bank

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,000
account or your wallet.

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,360
But the

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
main purpose of getting annual toll pass is that you pay one-time fee

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,640
and after that you are free for the whole year.  This

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,960
means that

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,280
whenever you cross any toll on any National Highway,

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,119
you will not have to make payment again and again.

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,000
Payments should not be deducted from your account repeatedly.

50
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,520
Annual charges will only be applicable.  This kind of

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
concept has been brought here.  And the

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,360
effort here is to

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,680
simplify things.  The toll payments should be

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,680
streamlined so that at

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
times,

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
you might have seen videos of toll plazas on highways, which keep

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,440
coming up.  People fight over

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,760
small amounts of money.  So all those things should

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,640
not happen.  Congestion should be reduced.  At the same time there should be

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,879
predictability here.  I mean,

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,200
you know, many times people travel a lot in a year and sometimes

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,120
they spend a lot of money i.e. ₹30, 40,

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,680
50,000 sometimes just

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,840
in paying the toll.  So that situation should not arise here.

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,440
Well now the first question here is

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,760
what are its features?  Please understand it carefully.  The

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,680
first question that comes is

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,239
who can use it?  Please take care.

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,160
This is not for commercial vehicles.

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,400
Not at all.  Which are yellow number

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
plates.  This is only for private non-

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
commercial vehicles.  It

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
is for four wheelers.  It is for cars.   It

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,879
is for Jeeps and Vais.  So this

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,120
is for four wheeler.  This is not even for two wheelers.

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,200
And this is only for private vehicles.

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,239
First things first.  Second,

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,280
what will be its price?  Its price will be ₹3000

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,400
annually.  Meaning you can take it every year

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,159
and you will have to pay ₹3000.  Since when is this being

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,360
implemented?  It is becoming operational

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,200
from 15 August 2025.  So this will start from Independence Day.

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,519
Then the next

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,400
question which is most important is

85
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,440
that can you go on the highways any number of times in 12 months or in a year, for example,

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,000
suppose you took this pass on 15th August, then

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,480
till 15th August 2026?

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,480
Meaning you can cross the toll

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,640
and no money will be deducted from your account.

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,159
Look, this is not an unlimited pass.  A

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,959
limit has been imposed here.  That means you

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,280
can cross the toll plaza maximum 200 times and

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,000
you will not have to pay any money if

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,239
you have taken annual pass.  So this is a very

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,120
important thing that suppose you

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,120

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,680
cross 200 toll plazas within 100 days, then it will

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,400
expire there itself.  And then whatever your normal

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
payment is, the same will be applicable here.  So this is a

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,239
very important thing because

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
people might not be aware about it because in the

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,720
things that were coming earlier, it was being said

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,120
that this will be an annual pass and

104
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,959
you can cross things here unlimited times as much as you want, you

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,599
can cross the toll, so this is an important thing.   The

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,760
second question here is what will be the mode of

108
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,599
use?  Will you have to get a separate pass

109
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,160
for this?  No, not at all.   This is

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,239
your Fast Tag account which is already

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,000
attached to your vehicle.  It will be

112
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,600
linked to that.  And I will tell you further

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,520
how you can apply this.

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,919
Basically here is a highway travel app.

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
NHAI website is done.  So

116
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,000
you can take it through all of this.  I will tell you that later.

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,800
And what are the eligible roads here

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,520
?

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,680
Understand carefully all the national highways in the country.  It is valid only on all the National

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,560
Highways in the country, not state highways,

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,440
where Fast Tag enabled toll

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,280
plazas are installed on National Highways.

123
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,720
Well, why was this scheme introduced

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,520
?  It is a simple thing that

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
private vehicle users, especially those who

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,600
live in satellite towns, have to travel up and down on a daily basis,

128
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,840
especially in Gurgaon,

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
Noida, Ghaziabad or Delhi, one has to

130
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
cross multiple tolls and make

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,680
payment

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,840
in short stretches, efforts are being made to avoid this

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
and this scheme provides

134
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,720
a cost effective flat rate

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,199
option for those travellers. Apart from this, there are

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,120

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
toll plazas every 60 to 70 kms,

138
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
due to which a lot of complaints come that

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,360
unfair toll collection is being done,

140
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,600
this should not happen, so that will also end

141
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
and because of the fixed pass system, the

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,520
arguments that you often see at toll plazas,

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,280
people quarrel over small amounts of money,

144
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
efforts are also being made to reduce that somewhere.

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,039
Apart from this, the digital infrastructure present here will

147
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,120
also be encouraged.  People will adopt Fast Tag

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,600
more and the efficiency will

149
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,080
increase here and the cashless transaction

150
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,320
mechanism will be implemented.  Well

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,479
here is another interesting thing which will

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,280
come to your mind that suppose

153
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,919
if you complete 200 trips in 100 days,

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,080
suppose in this case within 100 days,

155
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,160
you still know that there are 265 days left,

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,800
so what do you have to do here now, the very

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,039
next day after 100 days when your

158
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,759
200 trips are completed, can you

159
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,520
renew it again the next day and it is

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,039
interesting that it is said here that

161
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,080
no, this pass can be renewed only annually,

162
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,840
meaning if

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,720
you took this pass on 15th August, 2025, then you will be able to renew it next time

164
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,560
only in 2026 on 15th August.  So a

165
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
limitation has also been imposed on this that

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
annual pass means only annual.  It is

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,199
not possible that you can renew it every 150 or 200 days.

168
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520
Once your 200

169
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,160
trips are over, it is over.  Yes, this will happen

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,400
many times to people that a whole

171
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
year has passed.  He has made only 50

172
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
trips.  So in that case also it will end

173
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,919
within a year, whichever comes first.

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
Then now the question arises that

175
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,319
how can you purchase it?  Meaning,

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,240
how can you link the past tag that you already have

177
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
?  As soon as it gets activated

178
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,120
from 15th August onwards, you can see this

179
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,280
Highway Travel App, basically

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,360
this app has been developed by NHAI.

181
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,919
Simply download this app.  When you

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,479
go there, you can link your caste tag and your vehicle

183
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,880
number.  And then

184
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,199
after that it will ask you for payment for ₹3000.

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,840
You can make payment as per your wish

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,560
and once you get the confirmation,

187
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,360
you can make 200 trips in the entire year.

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,039
You won't have to spend any money anywhere.  So

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,599
either you download this app or it will be

190
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,080

191
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,240
activated through the NHUI website.  So you

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,639
can link it whichever way you want.  The next

193
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,319
question here is what are its conditions

194
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,800
?  Because many people will ask the

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,280
question that Sir, many times it happens that at a

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,280
toll plaza, ₹150 is charged there

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,360
and somewhere, suppose there is a toll plaza

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,599
where only ₹50 is charged.  Will the

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,880
same trip be counted at both the places?

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,440
It does not matter at all here

201
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,759
how much cost is being incurred at which toll plaza.  What matters is

202
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,160
if you

203
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,800
crossed the toll plaza cost.  Even if it

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,360
costs ₹200, even if it costs ₹50

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,319
, even if it costs ₹10, it doesn't matter.  If

206
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,560
you cross a toll plaza, it will

207
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
count as one point for you.  Whatever is in those 200 trips will be

208
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,319
counted.  And

209
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,720
I have already told you about the commercial use.  And also it has

210
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,759
pan India coverage.  Meaning it is

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,919
valid across all Fastag enabled National

212
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
Highways.  Well here another

213
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,840
question came to my mind and I tried to know

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
whether this will be applicable on expressways as well?

215
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,400
Because many people have questions, as

216
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
of today you see,

217
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,560
a lot of expressways have been built in the country.

218
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,479
So people prefer the expressways instead of going on the national highways which are normal highways

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,400

220
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,080
and the cost there is also

221
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
higher.  So will this apply there as well

222
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,320
?  So, look, as per my knowledge, according to the

223
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,519
things that have come in the report,

224
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,320
yes,

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,959
this will be applicable on the expressways and high speed corridors.

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,279
But the only condition should be that it should

227
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,279
come under NHAI.  And there should be a

228
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,519
fast tag enabled toll plaza, which is a must.

229
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,360
For example, Delhi Meerut

230
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,959
Expressway, Eastern Peripheral

231
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,399
Expressway, Mumbai Pune Expressway,

232
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,040
Delhi Mumbai Expressway, Bengaluru

233
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,279
Mysore, Ganga Expressway, that is, all the

234
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,519
expressways that

235
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,519
come under the jurisdiction of NHAI.  The

236
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,240
simple meaning is that

237
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,040
this annual pass will be applicable on any road which is under NHAI.

238
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,839
You do

239
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,760
n't have to pay any extra money.  Well,

240
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
what is its significance?  The first one is that, as I

241
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,440
told you, it is part of broader Digital India and

242
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,600
along with that a program was brought

243
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
by the government called Logistics Efficiency

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Enhancement Program,

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,320
you must have

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,160
heard that the government wants to bring ease of doing travel, ease of doing business, it wants to

247
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
improve your experience on highways

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,760
because many times the mood gets spoilt

249
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
when you are going somewhere,

250
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
going on a trip and when you see that the

251
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,560
road is good, it is a good thing, but the

252
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,720
way the cost is incurred, if you go from Delhi to

253
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Chandigarh, I mean in even the smallest distance of

254
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,680
250 kilometers, you end up spending Rs 5-500 to Rs 6600.

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,760
So because of this, the

256
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,839
government wants to bring ease of travelling

257
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,000
and wants to bring uniform toll practices

258
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,160
across the country and

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
wants to end the dependency on physical toll booths.   Apart from this,

260
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,640
India's

261
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,480
shift is also going towards automated tolling.

262
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,880
But yes, the question is whether the

263
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
government is also moving towards GPS based toll system

264
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,560
?  The ministry has

265
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,880
refused regarding this.  It has been said that currently we do

266
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,959
not have any such plan to move to GPS based tolling

267
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
system.  Right now, only the Fast Tag

268
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,959
system which is in place will be used.

269
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,640
What is its overall benefit?  Look, the

270
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,959
benefit here for drivers is that

271
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,360
they will save more money.  There used to be

272
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,360
long queues for the government.  The

273
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,279
amount of manpower required at toll plazas will be reduced.  It is

274
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
also good for the environment

275
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,680
as there will be fewer vehicles parked

276
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,839
at toll plazas and hence lower emissions.  Highway

277
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,600
operations will be better.  Traffic flow will improve.

278
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,600
Here I will give you an example as to

279
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,279
how you can benefit from this.  For

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,880
example, if you are in Delhi, especially

281
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
Gurgaon, and travel from Delhi to Gurgaon.

282
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
Many times people live in Gurgaon,

283
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,959
in the outskirts of Gurgaon, then the

284
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,200
people living there would know about Khidki Daula Toll

285
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,120
Plaza that means nowadays

286
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,360
Gurgaon has also expanded a lot.  So even

287
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
when you are travelling from one place to another from Gurgaon,

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,839
you

289
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,600
have to pay this cost.  When you are living in Manesar side

290
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,920
and when you are coming to interior Gurgaon then

291
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,720
you have to pay ₹60

292
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,880
one way and people do it on daily basis.

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,279
So if you look at the annual trip, suppose there are

294
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,160
250 working days, then

295
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,040
two days each means you have two trips,

296
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,800
you will cross the toll plaza twice, which

297
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,200
means you make 500 trips in a year, so

298
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,079
in that case normally, suppose

299
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,880
you go without a pass, then you will have to pay 60 * 500, i.e.

300
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,360
₹00. Now what happens with the pass is

301
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,200
that you have to pay only 3000 for 200 trips,

302
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,200
so it is the same for you, means out of 500 trips,

303
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,760
you will have to pay only 3000 for 200 trips

304
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,000
and then here for the remaining 300

305
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,480
trips, you will have to pay ₹60, which comes to

306
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,959
₹18,000.  That means

307
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,200
you are saving around ₹9,000 here.

308
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,360
Suppose, for those whose trip is not of 500 trips or

309
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
who have only 150-200 trips, then there is

310
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
a lot of benefit in this for them.   There

311
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,560
are lots of benefits.  You can easily do it for ₹3000

312
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,560
and I am talking about a toll of just ₹60.  At some

313
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,720
places the cost is ₹100,

314
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,320
so you can save even more in that.

315
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,240
But yes, it is obvious that there

316
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,079
is criticism regarding this.  There

317
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
are limitations because a limit has been imposed on two short trips,

318
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
which was not thought of earlier,

319
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
this is being

320
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
criticized somewhere, especially

321
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,880
by daily commuters.  Those who do

322
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,360
not have a daily commute are enjoying themselves and thinking that it is a

323
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,600
good thing.  But in Noida, Gurgaon, those who

324
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,279
work specifically on computers, they

325
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
trip on a daily basis.  In

326
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,519
a way, theirs will be finished in 100 days only.   There

327
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,639
is no flexibility.  Meaning if you use

328
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,240
only 50 in a year, suppose your users are

329
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,560
using it very less.  Used it only 10 times

330
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,480
, used it 20 times.  Your 180 trip is

331
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,880
over.  Went west.  Now that will

332
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,040
not be carried forward to next year.  So these

333
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,440
are all the things.  Well, whatever it is, what do you think

334
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,440
?  Is this Fast Tag Annual Tag

335
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,760
Pass introduced by the government?  is this

336
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
better?  No C I would like to know your opinion.  Please do

337
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,720
tell us in the comments.  And

338
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
before I go, a very interesting

339
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
question.  Can you tell me

340
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,600

341
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,760
what is the share of National Highways in the total road network in our country?  What

342
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,360
percentage is national highways?  And

343
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,040
you all know that the right answer to this will be found on my Instagram.

344
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,320

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,000
problem, you can get the

346
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
correct answer from Telegram.  And friends, as you all
