And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, finally the thing that many people were waiting for in India has been announced.  The Ministry of Road Transport has announced how the annual pass for Fast Tag will be implemented and how you can get it. Keep this in mind, let me tell you one thing. Earlier there was another talk that lifetime pass, meaning the pass for 15 years, will also be announced.  But it has been rejected now.  Right now, there is only annual pass, which means you can get the pass on yearly basis and you can see in this news, Nitin Gadkari announces tag annual pass.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail, what is this thing?  Meaning, what charges will be levied under this pass?  How many trips will you be able to make?  What is the criticism regarding this ?  And how will the number of trips be counted ?  I will tell you all that in detail. Let's move on.  Look, first of all the question here is what is this Fast Tag based annual toll pass ?  It's a simple thing.  You will see today's date, I am sure that all your vehicles will have Fast Tag.  That means, as you all know, there is a fast tag installed on the windshield of the vehicle and whenever you cross a toll, money is automatically deducted from your bank account or your wallet. But the main purpose of getting annual toll pass is that you pay one-time fee and after that you are free for the whole year.  This means that whenever you cross any toll on any National Highway, you will not have to make payment again and again. Payments should not be deducted from your account repeatedly. Annual charges will only be applicable.  This kind of concept has been brought here.  And the effort here is to simplify things.  The toll payments should be streamlined so that at times, you might have seen videos of toll plazas on highways, which keep coming up.  People fight over small amounts of money.  So all those things should not happen.  Congestion should be reduced.  At the same time there should be predictability here.  I mean, you know, many times people travel a lot in a year and sometimes they spend a lot of money i.e. ₹30, 40, 50,000 sometimes just in paying the toll.  So that situation should not arise here. Well now the first question here is what are its features?  Please understand it carefully.  The first question that comes is who can use it?  Please take care. This is not for commercial vehicles. Not at all.  Which are yellow number plates.  This is only for private non- commercial vehicles.  It is for four wheelers.  It is for cars.   It is for Jeeps and Vais.  So this is for four wheeler.  This is not even for two wheelers. And this is only for private vehicles. First things first.  Second, what will be its price?  Its price will be ₹3000 annually.  Meaning you can take it every year and you will have to pay ₹3000.  Since when is this being implemented?  It is becoming operational from 15 August 2025.  So this will start from Independence Day. Then the next question which is most important is that can you go on the highways any number of times in 12 months or in a year, for example, suppose you took this pass on 15th August, then till 15th August 2026? Meaning you can cross the toll and no money will be deducted from your account. Look, this is not an unlimited pass.  A limit has been imposed here.  That means you can cross the toll plaza maximum 200 times and you will not have to pay any money if you have taken annual pass.  So this is a very important thing that suppose you cross 200 toll plazas within 100 days, then it will expire there itself.  And then whatever your normal payment is, the same will be applicable here.  So this is a very important thing because people might not be aware about it because in the things that were coming earlier, it was being said that this will be an annual pass and you can cross things here unlimited times as much as you want, you can cross the toll, so this is an important thing.   The second question here is what will be the mode of use?  Will you have to get a separate pass for this?  No, not at all.   This is your Fast Tag account which is already attached to your vehicle.  It will be linked to that.  And I will tell you further how you can apply this. Basically here is a highway travel app. NHAI website is done.  So you can take it through all of this.  I will tell you that later. And what are the eligible roads here ? Understand carefully all the national highways in the country.  It is valid only on all the National Highways in the country, not state highways, where Fast Tag enabled toll plazas are installed on National Highways. Well, why was this scheme introduced ?  It is a simple thing that private vehicle users, especially those who live in satellite towns, have to travel up and down on a daily basis, especially in Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad or Delhi, one has to cross multiple tolls and make payment in short stretches, efforts are being made to avoid this and this scheme provides a cost effective flat rate option for those travellers. Apart from this, there are toll plazas every 60 to 70 kms, due to which a lot of complaints come that unfair toll collection is being done, this should not happen, so that will also end and because of the fixed pass system, the arguments that you often see at toll plazas, people quarrel over small amounts of money, efforts are also being made to reduce that somewhere. Apart from this, the digital infrastructure present here will also be encouraged.  People will adopt Fast Tag more and the efficiency will increase here and the cashless transaction mechanism will be implemented.  Well here is another interesting thing which will come to your mind that suppose if you complete 200 trips in 100 days, suppose in this case within 100 days, you still know that there are 265 days left, so what do you have to do here now, the very next day after 100 days when your 200 trips are completed, can you renew it again the next day and it is interesting that it is said here that no, this pass can be renewed only annually, meaning if you took this pass on 15th August, 2025, then you will be able to renew it next time only in 2026 on 15th August.  So a limitation has also been imposed on this that annual pass means only annual.  It is not possible that you can renew it every 150 or 200 days. Once your 200 trips are over, it is over.  Yes, this will happen many times to people that a whole year has passed.  He has made only 50 trips.  So in that case also it will end within a year, whichever comes first. Then now the question arises that how can you purchase it?  Meaning, how can you link the past tag that you already have ?  As soon as it gets activated from 15th August onwards, you can see this Highway Travel App, basically this app has been developed by NHAI. Simply download this app.  When you go there, you can link your caste tag and your vehicle number.  And then after that it will ask you for payment for ₹3000. You can make payment as per your wish and once you get the confirmation, you can make 200 trips in the entire year. You won't have to spend any money anywhere.  So either you download this app or it will be activated through the NHUI website.  So you can link it whichever way you want.  The next question here is what are its conditions ?  Because many people will ask the question that Sir, many times it happens that at a toll plaza, ₹150 is charged there and somewhere, suppose there is a toll plaza where only ₹50 is charged.  Will the same trip be counted at both the places? It does not matter at all here how much cost is being incurred at which toll plaza.  What matters is if you crossed the toll plaza cost.  Even if it costs ₹200, even if it costs ₹50 , even if it costs ₹10, it doesn't matter.  If you cross a toll plaza, it will count as one point for you.  Whatever is in those 200 trips will be counted.  And I have already told you about the commercial use.  And also it has pan India coverage.  Meaning it is valid across all Fastag enabled National Highways.  Well here another question came to my mind and I tried to know whether this will be applicable on expressways as well? Because many people have questions, as of today you see, a lot of expressways have been built in the country. So people prefer the expressways instead of going on the national highways which are normal highways and the cost there is also higher.  So will this apply there as well ?  So, look, as per my knowledge, according to the things that have come in the report, yes, this will be applicable on the expressways and high speed corridors. But the only condition should be that it should come under NHAI.  And there should be a fast tag enabled toll plaza, which is a must. For example, Delhi Meerut Expressway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway, Mumbai Pune Expressway, Delhi Mumbai Expressway, Bengaluru Mysore, Ganga Expressway, that is, all the expressways that come under the jurisdiction of NHAI.  The simple meaning is that this annual pass will be applicable on any road which is under NHAI. You do n't have to pay any extra money.  Well, what is its significance?  The first one is that, as I told you, it is part of broader Digital India and along with that a program was brought by the government called Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program, you must have heard that the government wants to bring ease of doing travel, ease of doing business, it wants to improve your experience on highways because many times the mood gets spoilt when you are going somewhere, going on a trip and when you see that the road is good, it is a good thing, but the way the cost is incurred, if you go from Delhi to Chandigarh, I mean in even the smallest distance of 250 kilometers, you end up spending Rs 5-500 to Rs 6600. So because of this, the government wants to bring ease of travelling and wants to bring uniform toll practices across the country and wants to end the dependency on physical toll booths.   Apart from this, India's shift is also going towards automated tolling. But yes, the question is whether the government is also moving towards GPS based toll system ?  The ministry has refused regarding this.  It has been said that currently we do not have any such plan to move to GPS based tolling system.  Right now, only the Fast Tag system which is in place will be used. What is its overall benefit?  Look, the benefit here for drivers is that they will save more money.  There used to be long queues for the government.  The amount of manpower required at toll plazas will be reduced.  It is also good for the environment as there will be fewer vehicles parked at toll plazas and hence lower emissions.  Highway operations will be better.  Traffic flow will improve. Here I will give you an example as to how you can benefit from this.  For example, if you are in Delhi, especially Gurgaon, and travel from Delhi to Gurgaon. Many times people live in Gurgaon, in the outskirts of Gurgaon, then the people living there would know about Khidki Daula Toll Plaza that means nowadays Gurgaon has also expanded a lot.  So even when you are travelling from one place to another from Gurgaon, you have to pay this cost.  When you are living in Manesar side and when you are coming to interior Gurgaon then you have to pay ₹60 one way and people do it on daily basis. So if you look at the annual trip, suppose there are 250 working days, then two days each means you have two trips, you will cross the toll plaza twice, which means you make 500 trips in a year, so in that case normally, suppose you go without a pass, then you will have to pay 60 * 500, i.e. ₹00. Now what happens with the pass is that you have to pay only 3000 for 200 trips, so it is the same for you, means out of 500 trips, you will have to pay only 3000 for 200 trips and then here for the remaining 300 trips, you will have to pay ₹60, which comes to ₹18,000.  That means you are saving around ₹9,000 here. Suppose, for those whose trip is not of 500 trips or who have only 150-200 trips, then there is a lot of benefit in this for them.   There are lots of benefits.  You can easily do it for ₹3000 and I am talking about a toll of just ₹60.  At some places the cost is ₹100, so you can save even more in that. But yes, it is obvious that there is criticism regarding this.  There are limitations because a limit has been imposed on two short trips, which was not thought of earlier, this is being criticized somewhere, especially by daily commuters.  Those who do not have a daily commute are enjoying themselves and thinking that it is a good thing.  But in Noida, Gurgaon, those who work specifically on computers, they trip on a daily basis.  In a way, theirs will be finished in 100 days only.   There is no flexibility.  Meaning if you use only 50 in a year, suppose your users are using it very less.  Used it only 10 times , used it 20 times.  Your 180 trip is over.  Went west.  Now that will not be carried forward to next year.  So these are all the things.  Well, whatever it is, what do you think ?  Is this Fast Tag Annual Tag Pass introduced by the government?  is this better?  No C I would like to know your opinion.
