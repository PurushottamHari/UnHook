Hello Friends.  Friends, yesterday Netan Yahoo made a statement which revealed what is the unstated objective of Israel which has jumped into this war?  See, what happens is that in any war, every country has its objective and its goal. So here it shows the whole world that yes, this is our goal.  We want to achieve this.  For example, Operation Sindoor was conducted by India.  What was our goal?   It was simple, we wanted to destroy the terror launch pads. And for the first time, we entered inside Pakistan and fired missiles there.  So here Israel has started this war with Iran, so here the stated objective is known to all but the unstated objective has been revealed somewhere by Netan Yahoo and because of this it becomes clear here that how Israel wants that the entire regime in Iran should be changed.  But is this possible because you see there is a lot of discussion going on about it. Israel's End Game May Be Regime Change in Iran But It's a Gamble. Can this be possible? I will tell you about this in a little detail.  You will get to know a lot.

You all know the context that Israel here started Operation Rising Line under which it carried out several attacks inside Iran and obviously this caused a stir in the whole of Iran. More than 200 sites were targeted. All the important commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed here, and in view of this, Iran has also done re-taliation on a very large scale, and here Netan Yahoo has said that he will also re-taliate.  So all these things will keep going on.  You know all this. But the question here is what is Israel's goal?  See what is the stated goal ?  Israel has said it clearly.  Netan Yahoo has clearly said that we have carried out this attack on Iran so that we can completely eliminate the nuclear threat that Iran is posing and the way it is developing nuclear weapons. Because once Iran makes nuclear weapons, it will become an existential threat to Israel.  Then it is not known whether Israel will survive or not.  So this is why Nathan Yahoo wants to destroy Iran before that.  But the question is what is the unstated goal here?  And you will see this when Nathan Yau made a statement which I will tell you about later. But it shows that Israel wants the regime inside Iran to be changed.  If you look at this time, Iran is an Islamic Republic and Israel wants to change it.  Now before I tell you about it, you need to know a little about how it became an Islamic Republic?  You all must be aware of the Revolution of 1979, under which the dynasty of Shah Mohammad Reza Pallavi, which was the monarchy, was uprooted and thrown away and then the Islamic Republic was formed in 1979. And let us understand this in a little detail. See, what happened was that in 1925, Reza Shah, with the help of western countries, brought the rule of Pahlavi Monarchy in Iran and after that his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ruled. So it was ruled by both of them since 1925.  So the Shah here was basically a Western-backed autocrat.  And he also brought modernization and secular reforms.  In 1963, a wide revolution took place in Iran under which land reforms were brought about.  Women's right to vote, these things were brought in.  A literacy campaign was launched. Industrialization was brought in.  It is said that the Iran that you see today was not like this earlier.  There was a lot of freedom there.  So this credit is given to Reza Shah in a way.  Then the problem that arises after this is that because of the arrival of all these things, the traditional land owners will obviously be very upset. He will not like land reforms. Inequality gradually started increasing. Apart from this, it was seen that all these things were being imposed on Iran by the Western countries and somewhere the religious conservatives got alienated.  They did not like these things and because of that, if you observe, you will see a lot of discontent in Iran in the 1960s and 1970s.  The political parties here were banned.   It was tightly controlled.  There was a secret police after learning lessons.  They used to brutally suppress dissent.  Apart from this, as modernization came to Iran, due to it, inflation, unemployment, rural urban migration, all these things started occurring.  The traditional and religious groups here started to oppose it in a way that Persian culture and Islamic culture are getting eroded.  So it shouldn't be like this.  Apart from this, the Shah and his inner circle were extremely corrupt and they had become detached from the Iranian people. So people were not liking it. So it is obvious that if such things start happening then an opposition will arise here and that opposition was basically the Shia religious leadership and their leader was Ayatollah Khomeini.  Now keep in mind, if we talk about Ayatollah Khamenei, in today's date, Ali Khamenei is the supreme leader, he is Khamenei KHA.  Ok? You have to take care.  I am talking about that time of 1960. So Ayatollah Khomeini in a way became the leader of the voice of resistance here. You can see that in 1963 Ayatollah Khomeini publicly opposed the secular policies of the Shah and publicly said that we do not believe in this and finally what was done to him, he was arrested, he was put in jail, finally he was exiled from Iraq and he went to France and later on, from there, from exile, these people became the spiritual and ideological leaders of the entire revolution, so it started from 1963 itself and somewhere or the other, he used to give the anti-Shah message through his speeches from Iraq and later on from France.  So here finally the question arises that how did this Iranian revolution happen?  This happened in 1978 and 79. It started in January 1978. What happened at that time was that the newspaper of the government under Shah, that is to say, within the Pallavi Dynasty, insulted Khamenei here. Now you think for yourself, the Khawani is a spiritual and ideological leader. Very close to the people.  You are insulting them, so ultimately this leads to mass protests throughout 1978. Strikes happen.  Violent crackdown takes place whatever happened inside Iran. And in September 1978 there is a so-called Black Friday massacre.  Where the military openly opened fire on protesters in Tehran, resulting in the death of 100s of people. In December 1978, more than 10 million people protested in anti-Shah demonstrations. You can see that on January 16, 1979, the Shah Mohammad Reza Shah fled from Iran and finally on February 1st, Khamenei returns and comes back to Iran. So it starts from here.  In fact, when Mohammad Shah left this place and fled to Iran, he asked his Prime Minister Shafoor Bakhtiar to control this place but obviously he could not control it.  And finally on February 11, 1979, the military declared neutrality and said that yes, this entire revolution was successful and Khamenei became the leader of the whole thing. Infact, let me show you how to become a leader. A referendum is held on the 38th of March and 31st of March 1979.  The people of Iran are asked whether they want an Islamic Republic?  So the answer of 98% of them was yes.  And finally on April 1, 1979, Iran was officially declared the Islamic Republic of Iran.  So I hope you have understood how the Islamic Republic of Iran was formed?  And you can see a new constitution approved through referendum.  And here Islamic theocracy with republicanism is merged. And here comes the concept of Wilayat-e- Faqi, meaning Guardianship of Islamic Juri, in which the entire power, religious and political authority is given to the leader. Who is the leader?  Basically the supreme leader. So, as of today, we see who is the biggest leader in the Islamic Republic of Iran?  Meaning in fact whatever he says happens.  There is no one in front of him.  And that is Supreme Leader Khamenei.  Ali Khamenei is the highest authority as of today.  So he was actually Ayatollah Khomeini at that time.  Now, Ali Khamani is the President here.  Alldo elections are held within Iran.   The President is elected but again there you will see very controlled things and he is under the supreme leader. Even though they are elected.  Then apart from this there is the Guardian Council. Then below that there is Majlis, which is the elected parliament but has very little power and IRGC was also formed basically to protect the revolution in a way. Iran must be protected.  What we have seen today, the IRGC Revolutionary Guard, it is completely their responsibility to protect Iran. Many of their commanders have been killed.  But see what effect it had?  This Islamic Republic of Iran became a Shia theocratic state in a way.  And the foreign policy here has completely changed.  Earlier it used to be a pro-western, pro-Israel, pro-Islamic movement, anti-Islamic movement. Now it has converted into anti-Western, anti-Israel and pro- Islamic movement.  And because of this, you can see that between 1980 to 1988, there was a war between Iran and Iraq.  This battle lasts a very long time. And Iraq started it but ultimately it did not yield any results. But Iran in a way became a regional power and through its proxy forces like Hezbollah, Hotej, from there you can see that this also started, how Iran placed its proxies in different places.  Now the question arises that what is its link with now.  Because yesterday Netanya Yahoo has given a message to the Iranian people.  Yes, there is a war going on here between Israel and Iran. But Netan Yahoo is here to give a message to Iranians saying Stand Up for Your Freedom from the Evil and Oppressive Regime.  This means that an oppressive regime currently exists in your country. You remove your leader.  Your leaders do not want your well being.  So this statement is not rhetoric.  This shows the intent of how Netanya and Israel want to exploit domestic dissatisfaction and bring about a regime change within Iran so that a permanent solution can be found.  Do you understand here?  Because who is the main threat to Iran?  Sorry from Iran, the main threat to Israel is from Iran.  So in a way, if everything changes within Iran, then Israel will no longer have any worries there. So this is a main thing.  Now look, the question is, what is the domestic discontent inside Iran?  Absolutely.   If you see here then Iranians are very frustrated.  Because of economic hardship.  GDP is not growing that much.   There is a lot of unemployment.  There is a constant separation on free speech. Women's Rights Valuation: You saw how fierce the Hijab protest was.  There is a lot of discussion about how hijabs were being burnt by women.  The way minorities are treated, the underlying unrest becomes a fertile ground for rebellion and somewhere Nathan Yau wants that the anger that is inside the people should come out on the streets so that when we attack Iran, people should get so upset that they start coming out on the streets and remove their own leader.  So here in fact, as you saw, Israel killed the Commander and Chief of IRGC.  The Chief of Staff of Iran Armed Forces killed him. Many senior officers of IRGC have been killed here.  So through this also the effort was being made to weaken the entire regime of Israel and when the protesters came on the streets, there should be no one to control them.  So, IRGC people have already been killed here.  But the question is, is this achievable? Will Israel be able to achieve what it wants?  Because Nathan Yahoo wants a chain reaction. Attack Iran. Create instability inside Iran. Because of that there will be uprising.  People will come out on the streets and ultimately this will lead to the collapse of the regime.  But it is also a huge gamble.  You have to understand.  There is no evidence yet inside Iran that shows people are going to come out on the streets. And even if we assume that a huge protest takes place, what will be its outcome ?  That is very unpredictable. How will you be able to think that yes, such things are going to happen.  Because now look let me tell you the reason. What is the power structure like inside Iran?  I just told you about the Supreme Leader and everything. But here are the basic things that you need to understand, that the hard liners and the unaided institutions of the IRGC are the ones who have real power.  Meaning, there is no one there to stage a coup. Because the one who is going to carry out the coup is himself in power.  For example, if we talk about Pakistan, what is shown externally in Pakistan is that the elected government, the Prime Minister , the press elected leaders are in power in a way.  Those people take the decision.  But we all know, the whole world knows who has the real power in Pakistan?  The army has it.  So this is the reason why there have been so many coups in Pakistan over the years. Till now no Prime Minister has been able to complete 5 years because the real power is with the army.  Whenever they feel that the civilian government is creating problems here, they change them. Now look at the recent example of Imran Khan, how he was replaced.  So inside Iran, they don't need to stage a collective control of the state.  So, the response may be more aggressive due to this step of Israel and what could be its possible outcome?  One way is that the whole regime in Iran might collapse.  This means that situations like Iraq and Syria can arise inside Iran.  A whole case can be filed.  There will be no leader left.  Or the second possibility could be that Iran becomes even more emboldened.  They started repressing their own people.  The regional aggression should increase further.  Then apart from this, last one could be the control transition. Meaning, the regime there should change gradually. But its chances are very nil.   It is very little.  Look at the reason behind this, there are two-three things. Because there is no single credible alternative here within Iran.  There had to be some alternative to bring in someone else.  The opposition is disjointed.   There is no agreement on leadership or on the type of future regime. Apart from this, let us talk about some notable figures here. Reza Pallavi, who was removed from power in 1967 by Shah, is his son Reza Pallavi, he advocates monarchy or democracy, secular democracy and he has also gone to Israel, he is quite popular but his internal base is not very strong, apart from this there is another one, Mujahideen e Khalq of ME, if you see, it supported Saddam here so that it could fight against Iran, so what happens is that there is a lot of opposition against him in his own country, Iran, he is unpopular. So because of this, the point of saying this is also an alternative here, I hope you have understood through this video that the chances of Israel 's unstated objective of changing the regime seem to be very low and it would be very difficult to do so.  We have to see whether this is possible or not.  But I hope you have learned a lot here and before leaving, a very interesting question: can you tell me which of the following countries Iran shares its longest border with?
