00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello Friends.  Friends, yesterday Netan Yahoo made

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,720
a statement which revealed

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,720

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,960
what is the unstated objective of Israel which has jumped into this war?  See, what

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,040
happens is that in any war, every country has

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,960
its objective and its goal.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,960
So here it shows the whole world

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,279
that yes, this is our goal.  We

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,039
want to achieve this.  For example, Operation Sindoor was

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,279
conducted by India.  What was our goal?   It was

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
simple, we wanted to destroy the terror launch pads.

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,439
And for the first time, we

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,240
entered inside Pakistan and

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,120
fired missiles there.  So here Israel has

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,040
started this war with Iran, so

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
here the stated objective is

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
known to all but the unstated

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,920
objective has been revealed somewhere by

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
Netan Yahoo and because of this it becomes clear here that

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,960
how Israel wants that the

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,120
entire regime in Iran should be

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
changed.  But is this possible

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
because you see there is a lot of discussion going on about it.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,680
Israel's End Game May

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,520
Be Regime Change in Iran But It's a Gamble.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,120
Can this be possible?

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
I will tell you about this in a little detail.  You will

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
get to know a lot.  But friends, let me

given in the comment section.  Let's get

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
started.  You all

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,680
know the context that Israel here

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,400
started Operation Rising Line

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
under which it carried out several attacks

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,799
inside Iran and obviously this caused a

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
stir in the whole of Iran.

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
More than 200 sites were targeted.

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,040
All the important commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
killed here, and in view of this, Iran has

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,600
also done re-taliation on a very large scale,

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,680
and here Netan Yahoo has said that

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
he will also re-taliate.  So all these

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
things will keep going on.  You know all this.

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,479
But the question here is

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,640
what is Israel's goal?  See what is the stated goal

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,360
?  Israel has said it clearly.  Netan Yahoo has

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
clearly said that we have carried out this attack on Iran

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,479
so that

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,479

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
we can completely eliminate the nuclear threat that Iran is posing and the way it is developing nuclear weapons.

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
Because once Iran makes nuclear weapons,

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,959
it will become an

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,360
existential threat to Israel.  Then

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,120
it is not known whether Israel will survive or not.  So

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
this is why Nathan Yahoo wants to

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,560
destroy Iran before that.  But the

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,959
question is

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,200
what is the unstated goal here?  And you will see this

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
when Nathan Yau made a statement which

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,440
I will tell you about later.

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,840
But it shows that Israel

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,480
wants the regime inside Iran to be

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,519
changed.  If you look at this time,

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,319
Iran is an Islamic Republic and

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,239
Israel wants to change it.  Now

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
before I tell you about it,

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,239
you need to know a little about

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,280
how it became an Islamic Republic?  You all must be aware

80
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,760
of the Revolution of 1979,

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,720
under which the dynasty of Shah Mohammad Reza

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,200
Pallavi, which was the monarchy, was

83
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,000
uprooted and thrown away and

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,519
then the Islamic Republic was formed in 1979.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,959
And let us understand this in a little detail.

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,440
See, what happened was that in 1925, Reza Shah, with the

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,159
help of western countries,

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
brought the rule of Pahlavi Monarchy in

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,040
Iran and after that his

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,720
son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ruled.

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,680
So it was ruled by both of them

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,640
since 1925.  So the Shah here was

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,720
basically a Western-backed autocrat.  And

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,280
he also brought modernization and secular

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,599
reforms.  In 1963, a wide

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
revolution took place in Iran under which

97
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,239
land reforms were brought about.  Women's right to

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,159
vote, these things were brought in.  A literacy campaign was launched.

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
Industrialization was brought in.  It is said

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,239
that the Iran that you

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
see today was not like this earlier.  There was a lot of

102
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,640
freedom there.  So this

103
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,959
credit is given to Reza Shah in a way.  Then the

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,360
problem that arises after this is that

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
because of the arrival of all these things, the traditional land

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799
owners will obviously be very upset.

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,120
He will not like land reforms.

108
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
Inequality gradually started increasing.

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
Apart from this, it was seen that all these

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
things were being imposed on Iran by the Western countries

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,680
and somewhere the religious

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,159
conservatives got alienated.  They did

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,919
not like these things and

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,160
because of that, if you observe,

115
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,079
you will see a lot of discontent in Iran in the 1960s and 1970s.  The

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
political

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,000
parties here were banned.   It was

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
tightly controlled.  There was a secret

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,600
police after learning lessons.  They used to brutally

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,759
suppress dissent.  Apart from this,

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
as modernization

122
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
came to Iran, due to it, inflation,

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
unemployment, rural urban migration,

124
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,840
all these things started occurring.  The

125
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,080
traditional and religious groups here

126
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000
started to oppose it in a way that

127
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,160
Persian culture and Islamic culture are getting

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,800
eroded.  So it shouldn't be like this.  Apart from

129
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,680
this, the Shah and his inner

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
circle were extremely corrupt and they had become

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
detached from the Iranian people.

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
So people were not liking it.

133
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,960
So it is obvious that if such things

134
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,680
start happening then an opposition will arise here

135
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,560
and that opposition was basically the Shia

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,199
religious leadership and their leader

137
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,840
was Ayatollah Khomeini.  Now keep in mind, if

138
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,880
we talk about Ayatollah Khamenei, in today's date,

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,120
Ali Khamenei is the supreme leader, he is Khamenei

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,520
KHA.  Ok?

141
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,240
You have to take care.  I am talking about that time of 1960.

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,440
So Ayatollah Khomeini in a way

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,160
became the leader of the voice of resistance here.

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,520
You can see that in 1963 Ayatollah Khomeini

145
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,919
publicly opposed the secular

146
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,080
policies of the Shah and publicly said that we do

147
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,479
not believe in this and finally what was

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
done to him, he was arrested, he was put in jail,

149
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,880
finally he was exiled from

150
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,160
Iraq and he went to France and

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,120
later on, from there, from exile,

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,919
these people became the spiritual and ideological leaders of the

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
entire revolution, so it

154
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,400
started from 1963 itself and somewhere or the

155
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,240
other, he used to give the anti-Shah message

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,039
through his speeches from

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,800
Iraq and later on from France.  So here

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,160
finally the question arises that how did this Iranian

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,880
revolution happen?  This happened in 1978 and 79.

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
It started in January 1978.

161
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,919
What happened at that time was that the newspaper of the government under Shah, that is to say,

162
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,800
within the Pallavi Dynasty,

163
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,960

164
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,919
insulted Khamenei here.

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,000
Now you think for yourself, the Khawani is a

166
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,680
spiritual and ideological leader.

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,440
Very close to the people.  You are

168
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
insulting them, so ultimately this

169
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
leads to mass protests throughout 1978.

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,240
Strikes happen.  Violent

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,280
crackdown takes place whatever happened inside Iran.

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,759
And in September 1978 there is a so-called Black Friday

173
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,759
massacre.  Where the military

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
openly opened fire on protesters

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,520
in Tehran, resulting in the death of 100s of people.

176
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,199
In December 1978, more than 10 million

177
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,000
people protested in anti-Shah

178
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,639
demonstrations.

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,919
You can see that on January 16, 1979, the

180
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,479
Shah Mohammad Reza Shah

181
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,280
fled from Iran and finally on February 1st,

182
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,039
Khamenei returns and comes back to Iran.

183
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,520
So it starts from here.  In

184
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,000
fact, when Mohammad Shah left this place and fled to

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,680
Iran, he

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,479

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,759
asked his Prime Minister Shafoor Bakhtiar to control this place but obviously he

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,960
could not control it.  And finally on

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,440
February 11, 1979, the military

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,840
declared neutrality and said that yes, this entire

192
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,240
revolution was successful and Khamenei

193
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,160
became the leader of the whole thing.

194
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,840
Infact, let me show you how to become a leader.

195
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,000
A referendum is held on the 38th of March and 31st of March 1979.  The

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
people of Iran are

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,360
asked whether they

198
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,039
want an Islamic Republic?  So the answer of 98% of them

199
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,680
was yes.  And finally on April 1, 1979,

200
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,680
Iran was officially declared the Islamic

201
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,520
Republic of Iran.  So I hope you have understood

202
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,520

203
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,599
how the Islamic Republic of Iran was formed?  And you can see a new

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,479
constitution approved through

205
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,120
referendum.  And here Islamic theocracy

206
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,440
with republicanism is merged.

207
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,319
And here comes the concept of Wilayat-e-

208
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,560
Faqi, meaning Guardianship of Islamic Juri,

209
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,800
in which the entire power, religious

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,360
and political authority is given to the leader.

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,960
Who is the leader?  Basically the supreme leader.

212
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
So, as of today, we see

213
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,960

214
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
who is the biggest leader in the Islamic Republic of Iran?  Meaning in

215
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,199
fact whatever he says happens.  There

216
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,680
is no one in front of him.  And that is Supreme

217
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,800
Leader Khamenei.  Ali Khamenei is the

218
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,839
highest authority as of today.  So he was actually

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,479
Ayatollah Khomeini at that time.  Now, Ali

220
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,080
Khamani is the President here.  Alldo

221
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,320
elections are held within Iran.   The

222
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,640
President is elected but again

223
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
there you will see very controlled

224
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,480
things and he is under the supreme leader.

225
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
Even though they

226
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,000
are elected.  Then apart from this there is the Guardian Council.

227
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,600
Then below that

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,240
there is Majlis, which is the elected parliament

229
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,240
but has very little power and IRGC was

230
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,839
also formed basically to

231
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
protect the revolution in a way.

232
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,519
Iran must be protected.  What we have

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,000
seen today, the IRGC

234
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,440
Revolutionary Guard, it is completely their

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,279
responsibility to protect Iran.

236
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,279
Many of their commanders have been

237
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
killed.  But see what effect it

238
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,279
had?  This Islamic Republic of Iran

239
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,440
became a Shia theocratic state in

240
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,120
a way.  And the foreign policy here has

241
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,200
completely changed.  Earlier it used to be a

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600
pro-western, pro-Israel, pro-Islamic

243
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,240
movement, anti-Islamic movement.

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,320
Now it has converted into anti-Western, anti-Israel and pro-

245
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,640
Islamic movement.  And

246
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
because of this, you can see that

247
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,120
between 1980 to 1988, there was a

248
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,120
war between Iran and Iraq.  This battle lasts a very long time.

249
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,640
And Iraq started it

250
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
but ultimately it did not yield any results.

251
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,360
But Iran in a way became a regional power

252
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,360
and through its proxy forces like

253
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,440
Hezbollah, Hotej, from there

254
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,440
you can see that this also started,

255
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,080
how Iran placed its proxies in

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,399
different places.  Now the question arises

257
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,320
that what is its link with now.  Because

258
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,480
yesterday Netanya Yahoo has given a message

259
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
to the Iranian people.  Yes, there is a

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,880
war going on here between Israel and Iran.

261
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,120
But Netan Yahoo is here to

262
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,240
give a message to Iranians saying Stand Up

263
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,200
for Your Freedom from the Evil and Oppressive

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,320
Regime.  This means that an oppressive regime currently exists in your country.

265
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,360
You

266
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,839
remove your leader.  Your leaders do

267
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,760
not want your well being.  So this statement is

268
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,640
not rhetoric.  This shows the

269
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,600
intent of how Netanya and

270
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,000
Israel

271
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,480
want to exploit domestic dissatisfaction and

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
bring about a regime change within Iran so that a

273
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
permanent solution can be found.  Do you

274
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,640
understand here?  Because

275
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,200
who is the main threat to Iran?  Sorry from Iran, the

276
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,279
main threat to Israel is from Iran.  So in a way, if

277
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
everything changes within Iran, then

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,360
Israel will no longer have any worries there.

279
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,880
So this is a main thing.  Now look, the

280
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,880
question is, what is the

281
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
domestic discontent inside Iran?  Absolutely.   If

282
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
you see here then Iranians are very

283
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,720
frustrated.  Because of economic

284
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,959
hardship.  GDP is not growing that much.   There

285
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,800
is a lot of unemployment.  There is a constant separation on free speech.

286
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,959
Women's Rights

287
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,680
Valuation: You saw how

288
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,519
fierce the Hijab protest was.  There is a lot of discussion about how hijabs were being burnt

289
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
by women.  The

290
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,680

291
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,440
way minorities are treated, the underlying

292
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,519
unrest becomes a fertile

293
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,519
ground for rebellion and

294
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,600
somewhere Nathan Yau wants that the

295
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,640
anger that is inside the people should come out on the streets so that

296
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,800
when we attack Iran, people should get so

297
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,600
upset that they start coming out on the streets

298
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,240
and remove their own leader.  So here in

299
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,560
fact, as

300
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,120
you saw, Israel

301
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,279
killed the Commander and Chief of IRGC.  The Chief of Staff

302
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
of Iran Armed Forces killed him.

303
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,160
Many senior officers of IRGC have been

304
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,079
killed here.  So through this also the

305
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,640
effort was being made to weaken the

306
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,800
entire regime of Israel

307
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,640
and when the protesters

308
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,880
came on the streets, there should be

309
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,800
no one to control them.  So, IRGC

310
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,760
people have already been killed here.  But the

311
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,839
question is, is this achievable?

312
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,079
Will Israel be

313
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,480
able to achieve what it wants?  Because Nathan Yahoo wants a chain reaction.

314
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,720
Attack Iran.

315
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,560
Create instability inside Iran.

316
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
Because of that there will be uprising.  People will

317
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,800
come out on the streets and ultimately this will lead to the

318
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,880
collapse of the regime.  But it is

319
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,639
also a huge gamble.  You have to understand.  There is no

320
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,959
evidence yet inside Iran that

321
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,800
shows people are going to come out on the streets.

322
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,279
And even if we assume that a huge

323
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,040
protest takes place, what will be its outcome

324
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,200
?  That is very unpredictable.

325
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,279
How will you be able to think that yes, such

326
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,360
things are going to happen.  Because now look let

327
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,040
me tell you the reason.

328
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,200
What is the power structure like inside Iran?  I just

329
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
told you about the Supreme Leader and everything.

330
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,600
But here are the basic things that

331
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,800
you need to understand, that the hard liners and the

332
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,800
unaided institutions of the IRGC are the ones who have

333
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,639
real power.  Meaning, there is

334
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,399
no one there to stage a coup.

335
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,160
Because the one who is going to carry out the coup is himself

336
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,560
in power.  For example, if we

337
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,920
talk about Pakistan,

338
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,360
what is shown externally in Pakistan is that the

339
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,399
elected government, the Prime Minister

340
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,160
, the press elected leaders are

341
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,519
in power in a way.  Those people

342
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,279
take the decision.  But we all know, the whole

343
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,839
world knows who has the real power

344
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,000
in Pakistan?  The army has it.  So

345
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,399
this is the reason why there have been so many coups in Pakistan over the years.

346
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,480
Till now no

347
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,399
Prime Minister has been able to complete 5 years

348
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,240
because the real power is with the army.  Whenever

349
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079
they feel that the civilian government is creating problems here, they

350
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,320
change them.

351
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,279
Now look at the recent example

352
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,120
of Imran Khan, how he was replaced.  So

353
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,360
inside Iran, they don't need to stage a collective

354
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,680
control of the state.  So, the

355
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,480
response may be more aggressive due

356
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,240
to this step of Israel and

357
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,240
what could be its possible outcome?  One way is

358
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,200
that the whole regime

359
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,519
in Iran might collapse.  This means that situations like Iraq and Syria can arise inside Iran.  A

360
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,920
whole case

361
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
can be filed.  There will be no leader left.  Or the

362
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,120
second possibility could be that Iran becomes

363
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,360
even more emboldened.  They

364
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,279
started repressing their own people.  The regional aggression should

365
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
increase further.  Then apart from this,

366
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,199
last one could be the control transition.

367
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,839
Meaning, the regime there should change gradually.

368
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,160
But its chances are very nil.   It

369
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,480
is very little.  Look at the reason behind this, there are two-three things.

370
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,880
Because there is no single credible alternative here within Iran.  There had to

371
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,880

372
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,199
be some alternative to bring in someone else.  The

373
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,959
opposition is disjointed.   There

374
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
is no agreement on leadership or on the

375
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,720
type of future regime.

376
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,839
Apart from this, let us talk about some notable figures here.

377
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,440
Reza Pallavi, who was removed from power

378
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,160
in 1967 by Shah,

379
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,959
is his son Reza Pallavi, he advocates

380
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,600
monarchy or democracy, secular

381
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,920
democracy and he has also gone to Israel, he is quite

382
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,839
popular but his internal base is

383
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,120
not very strong, apart from this there

384
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,440
is another one, Mujahideen e Khalq of ME,

385
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,440
if you see, it supported Saddam here

386
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,680
so that it could fight against Iran, so

387
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
what happens is that there is a lot of opposition against him in his own country, Iran, he is

388
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,000
unpopular.

389
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
So because of this, the

390
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
point of saying this is also an alternative here, I hope you have understood

391
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,399
through this video that the chances of Israel

392
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,279
's unstated objective of

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,079
changing the regime seem to be very low and it would be

394
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,600
very difficult to do so.  We

395
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,360
have to see whether this is possible or

396
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
not.  But I hope you have learned a lot here

397
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
and before leaving, a

398
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,480
very interesting question: can you tell me which of

399
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,720
