Rajashi Nandi is back on TRS. They say that this is the era where Scand the Hindu god of war returns to the mainstream across India and across the whole globe. The deity called Scando Kartaka is waking up once again. It's a very misunderstood and misrepresented subject from the realms of Sanatan Dharm. And that's the gap that we hope to bridge alongside India's premier tantra expert Rajasi Nandi who returns on the Radi show. [Music] Jaba Jakam Jaba Jakatara Jat going to begin this conversation straight up. I have this one doubt which I've not been able to understand completely or been able to explain it to people who've asked me the same doubt. When we talk about the concept of Shiv Shaki most M Sanad visualize Shiv Gi married to Parvatima and then they have two children Gpati and Scand correct uh this whole question is going to lead itself to Scand okay but first I'd like to know about Shiv Shaki a little bit I think most sanatanis at this point know the story of Sati right uh and then Parvatima right that that is shown to us in television shows etc. Now before the birth of Gpati when they they were just living as husband and wife Shiv and Parvati can I look at Kalima being equivalent of the Parvati that was married to Shiv G before Gpati was created or how am I supposed to look at Kalima with respect to Shiv Shaki? Is she even related? Okay. Or is it a whole other dity? So very good question actually. uh Shiva and Shaki are the primordial beings of the universe the way and I will explain this not just from whatever is the texts and all but more from the way I look at it so it's easier to explain to me what is my reality or how do I equate with them so Shiva and Shi fundamentally are the uh everything in the universe is either Shiva or Shaki or sometimes a mix of both also right and the easiest way to understand this is there is one ultimate reality call it Brahman whatever else. So that reality has two uh segments or two two divisions. One division is static okay static means it does not move. It is in absolute knowledge. Okay. It sees everything the allseeing eye sort of and is attached to nothing. Okay. It is in deep wisdom and knowledge but it is nonattached to anything else. Let us say that this specific aspect of the Brahman we call it as Shiva. And then there is the other aspect which is the executive power. The ability to do things. Okay. Not just wisdom. Along with that there is karma. There's ka activity. There is something there's a force. There's an agency to cause events to happen creation to come into existence. That creative force that executive power is shy. Together these two have formed it's one being in two different poises. Poises means two ways of looking at the same two different activities attributes it's doing. So if there was only the static aspect of the Brahman of only Shiva was there then there would be no need for a creation. In fact that is what the stories tell us in the puranas. For a long time there was no creation at all because he was in deep samadi. And then there was assuras and they were troubling and things like that. And the god said that only a son born from Shiva or a child born from him can uh you know defeat this negative thing. So basically Shiva is in samadhi. He's not interested in the world anyway. He's beyond the world. He's completely transcendental. But there is a part of Shiva his own projection for example which is his creative power his shi which creates the world which has made the world from the highest gods to the to the most inscentient the most uh say the stone on the road that is also a product of the shi the human being is a product of shy everything is a product of shaky and this shi is a projection of shiva so this is the two ultimate polarities of the universe we you me everybody we are in a world of shy completely everything is shaky. Okay. However, there are all types of shakis. There is vidya shaky, there's aidy shaky, there is positive shaky, there's negative shaky. Assuras are shakis. Whereas gods are shakis. Good qualities are shakis. Bad qualities are also shakis. So we have to be discrim. We have to discriminate between all this. What is it we want? What is it we don't want which helps us accordingly? We do spiritual practices that helps us to choose the things that will help us to grow further because if you if somebody pursues the avid shakis they will fall down and fall down and eventually be completely destroyed and in more painful conditions larger periods of time. So these are the two main fundamental aspects of reality. Shi has created the whole world and this shi we call as parvati at the initial stages when she's married to Shiva. Okay. Where the shi is very pliant to Shiva. like a very faithful wife, okay, who's uh looking after the all that is needed for the husband and things like that. So that is a very shy which is more demure in nature and highly dedicated to the very static transcendental lord Shiva that Kali is also shaky but slightly different. She is a very dynamic outpouring from Parvati. Let's put it this way. There's one shaky sometimes she's Parvati. Sometimes she's Kali. Sometimes from Kali she becomes all the 10 mahavidyas. She can be various things as Kali she is her story is different. So she is a out andout goddess for destruction of negatives in Assuras and not just negatives in the world outside sometimes negatives within us. Okay. So that aspect of Kali is so fierce and so powerful that she's uh when she comes into a battle she's almost unstoppable even by the gods. To summarize what you said and please correct me where you think I've understood it wrong. When we talk about reality of the universe around us, it can be understood as being of two parts. There is pure stillness, right? Which can be understood to be Shiva and then there's the other side which is all the energy, all the power of the universe which can be understood to be shy. Correct? And together as Shiva and Parvati or Shiv Shaki, they constitute the universe. That is what the fabric of reality is made of. Right. Right. Now simply that shy because it's raw energy, it can mold itself into many different kinds of energy. Correct. Absolutely. And those different kinds of energy are what we call the different types of shaki. So all the divine feminine aspects of energy that we worship in sanata. Correct. Now out of all these versions of shi there are certain ones that we worship as a goddess. So it can be understood from this whole paragraph that uh shi or parvatima can take up different roles in the universe for different purposes. Right? And one of those highly ferocious roles is the role of kali. Correct? And then eventually she goes back to being bati. No. So the beauty the play of the gods we call it leela. Okay. Leela is a play. Uh play of the gods is that once so maali is herself like an independent deity. Okay. So not just her all the dust mahavidas are independent deities independent forms of shi and once they come into existence they will remain there they will always be there interacting with upasakas or doing some things in the world of creation etc. But my point is all this anybody who has movement shi is movement and nothing else. When you move there is always a change. So basic idea is there's a change of pressure there's a change of force that happens right there's a momentum. Right? Now think about it this way. We are sitting in this room, right? This room is on placed on planet earth. Earth is moving around the sun. The earth and sun are moving around something else. Okay? That something is moving around another greater circle. So there is constant movement going on layers and layers inter layers of movement. This whole movement is shy. And the point and this is a very interesting thing. All shy revolves around the point of stillness relative to itself. It's very important to understand that. So Shiva is like the earth for example is moving around the sun. So sun is for uh let's approximately saying not scientifically saying so approximately let's say that the sun is the center of the solar system right so sun becomes relatively like shiva and the grahas are different forms of shakis moving around earth is one shaky the moon is one shaky like that okay so wherever there's movement there is also a point of stillness relative to that movement now this whole arrangement of the sun and the solar system is also moving around some other center that center is the Shiva of this whole movement. So Shiva is that stillness is not a point it is a depth of stillness. What degree of stillness? If you if you take a man into a position where absolute stillness we don't have stillness inside us. Why? That's because there's sound. There's you are sitting here there's some ambient noise something like that. Your senses give you an idea of the approximate location of other things. There's some vibration that you are catching. Right? If you were to cut off everything absolutely still, it can cause a lot of disorientation in the mind. That is stillness because your mind is not able to fathom what is there. In absolute stillness, a person can go absolutely mad also unless the Aadhaar the mind and the body has the capacity to take it. That is why sadha has to be done. So yes, Parvati Garvati is a is the devoted shi of Shiva whereas the form of Kali and others, she has different functions in the universe. She's also the upasia dvata of tantra in in in sadhana in tantra sadhana or even without tandra sadha also she is a ishta devi of many people across India especially eastern India and also other parts of India. Okay now we have to move to the actual core of the topic I'm trying to get to which is what we planned for this episode which is kartika or scand. Yes the dity that I feel a deep connection with. It's a dity that you feel a deep connection with. It's a dity that many people in Tamil Nadu feel a deep connection with. Why not Bengal and New Delhi and Punjab and Maharashtra? So not just Tamil Nadu I think even Kerala and many other in the southern states also there are some influence of Scandanda or Subramani or Kartik. Coming to this question why not Bengal? So at least till the time of say the 8th 9th century uh there is good evidence from sculptures and other things that scandha upasana was very popular across India not just Tamil Nadu it was he was a primary deity who used to worship uh at that time India extended earlier India extended to include central Asia Afghanistan those areas so from that area till Bengal there used to be many various sculptures and things related to scandha that we have disced covered. So we can very safely conclude that he was a panindia deity. We used to worship everybody used to worship in Bengal in north Bengal there are areas right now though it's that area is nothing but where uh there was a reference to a huge kanda temple and that references is found in texts in Kashmir Kashmir uh you know scholars and not today's scholars scholars of the you know that 9th 10th century they referred to a great scanda temple in north Bengal there is uh in south Bengal also there were the trader communities who used to worship scanda there were places where tribals used to worship scanda We used to call him Kartika. This same dity. The iconography are slight differences but otherwise same effectively represented by holding a spear. Huh. So I in Bengal side when we worship Kartika he's even now Kartik puja happens in Bengal by the way in the village areas and all that. It's quite popular in certain cities it's popular. It's a remnant from that time. Uh he holds a bow and arrow in in Bengal. Bengal. Yeah. Uh he holds a bow and arrow but the peacock is there as the vahana. And uh see there are two similarities between the weapons. He holds a bow and arrow. And in South India he holds what is called the veil. Okay? Like a spear. Both of them are weapons that are to be shot. They they work from a distance right? You don't have to shoot come close to somebody to shoot. You can shoot from a distance. So basically the indication is that his power is so swift that it will work. Distance doesn't matter. So he need not uh be physically right next to you when he's protecting an upasa even before the problem actually comes from a distance he can actually neutralize that that is his power and this knowledge by the way I will not go details into it but this knowledge of the the iconography of the astras the weapons of the deities and their consecutive consequent mantras in the upasana is the peak of mantra sadena there are ways in which the astras of dvatas can be activated Whether it's maali, whether it's tara, whether it's kanda, whether it's the trishula, there are ways to activate that. There mantra sadas, a complicated process. It's not so easy and it's not meant for everybody. What do you mean activate? Uh then the astra is the ultimate of mantra shastra means basically it is just like I had mentioned before also that we consider the dvata as same as the mantra. So each of these weapons also have their own mantras and there's a process to activate that. And the third thing about the mantras of the dvatas of the of the astras is that they are very sharp. That's why they called astras. So they are weapons. Once you activate them, they will show a result. Now if the person who activated that astra is not steady enough, it can cause some damage to the person also who is trying to act. Yes. Because it's a weapon at the end of the day. So who can control the weapon? Only the dity can control the weapon. Nobody else can control an astra. So this concept is there in the mandra shastras. Even today there are people who worship the veil of scandal specifically. In fact the veil that is there of scand in south is considered to be equivalent to scand himself. You mean the spear right? Spear. So you can have the sphere and you can do puja of this sphere and that is as good as having kartika with you. Okay. There a lot of people do that. In fact, I myself uh have a veil which I carry wherever I'm going and suppose I have to go to see for any work. I'm staying in a hotel or something. First thing I'll do is that I'll place this the veil there and do a little bit namaskcara with certain mantras. Basically, it clears the area of all negatives. The veil has that kind of power. So Kartika the beautiful thing about Lord Kartika is that first of all he was popular across India and uh in some references uh long back it's again I'm talking about 8 9th century those time he was very popular in the areas that we have today like hana and those places extremely popular okay uh that uh and the worship of kartika does another thing it brings a steady power of Mars in fact the brihyat parasa horastra which is a text on jotisha very old text mentions that when there are problems of Mars you worship Kartika okay you mean energy levels energy levels so he is more he's a dity you can control Mars okay so any issues with Mars can be controlled by Kartika what are issues with Mars like anything for example injuries are happening blood related problems land related issues fights conflicts so Mars is also known as mongal mongal means good right so when mars is positive It will make somebody feel good about the environment. Mars is very important in say relationships for example fights or the lack of fights whatever uh injuries any kind of warfare. So Kartika is a deity who Kartika is the general of the gods. Remember that his birth is very beautiful. When the gods could not find a way to destroy an assura they worshiped Shiva and it was the prophecy was that only Shiva has a child. there and only that child will be able to destroy that assura and then from Shiva came birth of Kartika happens and the story is like this that uh the ura the the vidya of Shiva the seaman of Shiva it it's believed that when the vira of Shiva uh came out it was taken by it it fell because it was there was so much power in it was it was like a burning hot thing because remember that the daties do not have physical body these are stories to tell you a a lesson deeper lesson. A dity doesn't have physical body like you and me. So you may ask that what exactly does it mean? We come to that part later. But the story goes that the vidya was so powerful that it fell in the waters. The water could not carry it. It fell into fire. Fire could not carry it. It's so hot so powerful. And then it was taken up by a it fell in a reed in in a forest small forest of bushes of bushy leaves and all that. Those leaves that forested area that's called the sharavana. Saravana means somebody who's born out of those leaves in that and then at that time there were six matrias very fierce deities in the sky which are connected to the nakshhatra called kitika. Kitika is a nakhatra in the zodiac. Then nakshhatra has six stars. These six stars are like six matrias very fierce women. Okay. They came down and nursed that baby. So each of them nursed. So there were like six parts of that vidya and they uh it started growing growing growing and it had six heads. Eventually when it grew up then Parvati came and hold all of them together and those six come together. So therefore the number six has a strong connection to Kartika and in jotica six is the house of conflicts of war. So he here is a being who a god of war and in this story he's born entirely from the vir of Shiva. So he doesn't pass through the womb. There is no point where he's passing through the womb and developing. So there's a moral to this story and then once he goes up grows up he becomes so powerful that first of all Indra gets scared because he's able to defeat anybody there's nobody who can defeat him so powerful and then he goes into fight with the gods and as he's fighting with the daties at the assuras multiple times he's fighting different times at the end there's a six- day war that happens and before the last day Parvati gives him the veil the astra using that he's able to defeat the assuras okay that veil So here is a deity whose whole body is of the entire masculine energy. There is no other god in our pantheon whose whole formation has only masculine energy. It's only gartika. Okay. Absolutely raw power of Mars. Raw power of Mars from top to bottom. Only shi that he carries is the ve through which he destroys the assuras. Okay. And he's the general of the gods. What does a general mean? So we can say that um uh there are so many warrior gods in our we worship right? Hanumanji is a warrior god. So many other gods are there. Vera is also warrior in some sense. But the interesting thing about kartika is that we call in the general of the gods. Being a general means you have the ability to strategize various things. You can use multiple astras. You can use multiple things to attack. That is the that is the beauty of the general. Okay. Whereas a specific dity will have its say Mali has her direct contact of attack and I'm just as a way of explaining I'm saying okay not to take it literally in that sense but it gives a spiritual insight of what it meant whereas a general means that he has in his uh disposal at his disposal the weapons of all the gods because he's the leader of the army okay and then uh there are there's another aspect of scand which is that when he is not carrying the veil or the bow and arrow that he has in Bengal side that we do. So that time he's an entirely a deity as I said as completely uh purusha purusha is the masculine energy when we use the word masculine we automatically in the western sense of the word is somebody who's like you know maybe six pack abs and doing this and that no it's not masculine in that that sense because remember they don't have a physical body it's masculine in the head okay in that strength and the determination so once is determined that this has to be done it will be done nobody in the in the 14 universes can stop him. That strength and determination is considered to be a masculine quality in the spiritual sense. Second thing is uh as I mentioned right now Shiva and Shaki. So he is the son of Shiva who is it's as if literally he is the son of only Shiva. The purusha is so prominent in him. So he enters without the veil he becomes a guru. Okay. He becomes a guru means he enters into the state of samadhi and he becomes known as gua. Guha is the cave dweller. The cave is where inside the human heart. So he goes inside his states enters into a state of adwam. Adwatam is the when all realization of the brahman becomes prevalent to the person and the static force of the universe which I called Shiva right now that he realizes very quickly and he enters into that state and he can give up. He goes so high so deepish means he he acquires the ability to give the advice of the prava even to lord Shiva who is his father okay but just to complete this when he holds the veil that is when he goes out and fights so either he's a guru when he's sitting in the depth of the heart when he's become gua or he's the warrior per excellence how is he different from Shiva if it was only Shiva's masculine energy that created Yes, that's because Shiva is vast. Okay, Shiva encompasses everything. Shiva encompasses even those states which are not uh uh let's say that those states of spirituality which is inaccessible to human beings even that is Shiva. There's a vastness about Shiva. Okay, absolute subtle, very subtle, very vast and also transcendental. Remember that a large part of Shiva is transcendental. Paramasha or Parasa which is not even in creation. He's not interested in the creation. He's beyond the creation. We cannot even imagine what he is. Forget about any mantras all that comes later. We can't imagine what this being is. Okay. But Kartika is a child of Sha which means a portion of his energy who has that masculine energies directly come down here. He is inside creation. The second thing about Kartika just like Bhava is that his energy is very easy to access. Shiva is very difficult to access relatively speaking. Of course if somebody has purja samscara may get to shiva quickly that's one of cases can happen but Shiva is so subtle that's not easy kartika on the other hand is very connected to the earth to this physical manifestation plane that is in corresponding to kartika look at it so beautifully done is gpati gapati's creation story is that it is he is made entirely from parvati and only the head is that what shiva puts o okay that was going to be a question I was going to ask what's The difference between the two brothers. Let's expand this. Yeah. So this this is fundamentally at the end of the day these are two paths of spirituality. Okay. One is the path of scand and one is the path of gpati. The path of gpati uh is a little bit more intuitive because he is fully made of shaky data. Only the head was put of Shiva. Okay. It gives a certain direction because remember in shakti basana everything is shy. It's very easy to ex experience shy. What is difficult is discrimination, self-control and to follow only the vidya shaky and not get diverted by aidya shaky because everything is shaky. Even the assuras are shaky. But you are not to follow that path. You have to follow the path that will take that will take the human soul to higher states. That is why the head of GPati is changed into the head by Shiva. So gives direction. But Gpati is very intuitive. He's extremely intelligent. He has the knowledge of all the 64 arts. So all these things 64 arts, these etc things are manifestation of shi. He has mastered he knows all that and he's also the Brahman of course because he's a god at the end of the day. So we worship Gpati as the beginning of all things because with his superior intelligence he will get the thing done. Even what you cannot imagine there's a problem you're stuck somewhere. He knows how to get you out of it. Gpati is of course there's much more to Gpati than that. I'm saying in a very brief line. So he gpati represents the path of shi and historically though interestingly we'll see that um uh while gapati was popular uh even in the vic times but the major focus of gpatiasa started about uh 1200 or 1300 years from earlier it's like the focus means there's a whole the whole um the sect of gapati ganapatayas who worship exclusively gpati that came in very prominently a little later according to scholars it wasn't as popular in the vic times little later. Uh so so basically as the world progresses there is a reason for this. The vic scriptures are very oriented towards the purusha. So when you study the Vedas the most important thing is absolute discipline. So there are people you'll see practicing the vic chanting to get the correct sara for 20 30 years continuously practicing continuous you perfection discipline consistency perfection. These are qualities of the purusha data. Perfection, perfection, perfection. Practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. Masculine energy within spiritual guru. Yes, that is the path of the purusha. Whereas a little later towards say the post upanishadik era the puranas came in the tantras became prominent. There the energy is more feminine. Feminine energy is organic and intuitive. More intuitive. Okay. So Gpati that story comes to us now when Shiva and Parvati says that who can cross cover up the you know and go around the world. So what Gpati does is that he goes down Shiva and Shaki says it's done the whole world is here. Okay. So that's a very intuitive and intelligent way of getting the problem solved. Whereas Kartika goes in his vahana across the world because he follows the straight path and he follows the path of determination. There's strong determination that whatever when his blessings come. See uh it's not a comparison of the two. So they are doing a leela leela means they demonstrating to the world that these are different paths through which you can go depending on the individual. So GPA's path is very intelligent organic. That's that that intelligence automatically comes and that is why one of the reasons why it is recommended for people who practice jotic astrology to get some blessings of Gandati because he will help you to see the combinations very quickly of the grahas. What does this mean? So expands your uh quick intelligent power and also puts it in the service of spirituality. That is his beautiful blessing. Whereas kanda is that warrior sense that uh you'll also see in south India for example especially in Tamil Nadu and also in the some of the Hindus who live outside of Tamil Nadu in other uh south Asian countries. So when scand festivals happen they you'll see them piercing their bodies with veils here or hanging themselves walking on fire and doing various kinds of very fierce practices. So those are aligned to the burusha. Okay. They're very much aligned to the bush masculine practice. Yes. So you you do you torture yourself a bit. Okay. That brings about a terrific concentration. You concentrate on one thing like the veil. So once he releases the veil towards the target, nothing can stop it. Even if it's a mountain or break through the mountain and go and hit the target. Same way his his veil represents determination, concentration and victory. Once that veil or blessing of the veil comes to an upasa or to a scandu basa that furious energy to succeed comes in nothing can stop that person some surface level questions now yes um I think this is a concept we've discussed on multiple episodes with yourself as well as other speakers on sanatan um often when you pray to a particular dity or when you're involved in a particular opasa you do pick up characteristics of that dity correct Absolutely. I see this with so many of the Krishna opas who come on the show. They are blissed out more than normal. Uh there's certain sense of contentment. With the Shiva, it's usually for lack of better word some kind of detachment or there's a little withdrawn. Um with shaktias, it's a lot of intensity. So what would be the adjective associated with scandupasa? I find scandupasana to bring about a tremendous intensity in an upasa. Shakti upasana is not just intensity. It could depends on the shi. If it's tripur sunundi it's very different. It's very there's a that bliss that you talk about in vaynava krishna opasakas that equal amount of bliss comes in even with triurundi terrific amount of bliss. Scand's beauty is that that determination comes in the uppasaka that determination and that uh to for lack of better words people around may find even that person to be a little arrogant but it's not arrogance it's the power of Mars that works that way because once you set in your mind you will get it done and there's no amount of opposition that can stop you nothing it's like that fixed energy he grips the soul and the body and he gives floods the upasa with so much energy so energy that you feel that you can there's nothing that can stop you success is guaranteed in fact very interestingly uh I mentioned it once earlier somewhere there are old texts in Nepal and other areas and somebody had sent a copy of that text to me uh where till again 7th 8th century when scandupasana was popular across India scanda was considered as the vic equivalent of vata vata is a small child form of varandha was also considered as the son of Shiva and Parvati as a small child and scandupasana by the way is very old. It comes from the Vedas the Atarva itself there is a whole uh section of you know mentions about scandupasa the other thing about scandupasana even see in the uh in Bihar and other regions there's a chhattpuja that is so popular right to shashi devi is woripped the sixth day chhat ppuja uh sixth day shashi dev is also worshiped in Bengal site when a child is born the sixth day there's a puja done so protection of children was also a domain that scand used to take care of protecting from serpas nagas. So there is a iconography of scandha where scandha is there the vahana which is the peacock is there and that peacock is actually biting into a snake because peacocks are enemies of snakes bites into a snake and with a with the talons of the peacock with the it's only gripping another snake like that. So this is a very popular iconography and in a temple like uh in south it's a temple called kukes subrain in Bangalore where people go to do various pujas for serposha serpent related problems and all that socandha becomes the lord who can control surplus it's very powerful thing very very powerful thing and it has got tremendous implications in spirituality that he has the ability to control serpus serpas are of serpas are basically you can look at it as you know these um lower emotions, envy, jealousy, anger, these are all representative by his karpas, serpas. Okay. So that things he can he can his vahana and his upasana can grip that uh negative feeling or energy and protect upasa from that. You gain discipline over your own mind. Absolutely. And discipline over your life. Okay. Do you see reflections of scandopasa in Tamil friends that you have? Because I I see it a little bit. I have a friend called Madan Gowi. Okay. He's the one of the biggest Tamil YouTubers in our country. Whenever I speak to him, everything that you again very masculine guy, disciplined, consistency, stillness, very relaxed, never heard him say a negative word about another YouTuber, self assured. Um and he's one of my Tamil friends. I have many other Tamil friends who are scandas. Same as Muruga. Yeah, same Murugan Muruga. Same date. Anything you'd like to say about Tamil identity because it's also the most successful state in our country's independent history. I love Tamil. I've been there. I've stayed there for some time. I go there often and I visit uh for specifically for the Scanda temples. I visit Parani which is a one of the six main temples of Scandanda. Many are there. That's one of the primary and powerful temples and there are other temples also of Scandanda. So in order to uh take a dash of Bhagavan Scandanda I do visit uh Tamil Nadu very often and in fact last year we had gone me and two of my people had gone on a road trip uh across Tamil Nadu looking for a land for temple. U so yeah I I like Tamil Nadu very much. In fact, it is here in Tamil Nadu only which where I had bought my first Vikrahov scand in Chennai and I had kept it in my home for no specific reason. If somebody used to tell me why why have you kept it give it to somebody and my answer would be that I'm going to worship him but I don't know when and then things certain things happened and I was forced into the worship of scand and then I started enjoying it and it's absolutely terrific and I've had people come to me help me out in times of crisis and difficulty who have some of the other links to scanda and I've seen that many times happening many times people born on scandi or worshiping scand out of the blue coming and you know helping me out in a difficult situation situation a crisis situation. So Scanda is a terrific dity and I believe that we will come to a time when the worship of Scanda will again become pan India. Okay, great you brought this up. I have to bring in some alternative angles here. Yeah, my entire time period of last year was about interreligious studies, going abroad, understanding different cultures etc. did a lot of episodes on British occult with the occultists there. Uh what they told me is that when Europeans kind of set out to conquer the world, it was actually very good for Europe's financial trajectory. Okay, perhaps that was one of the intentions behind going out and conquering different countries. There's a life experience I recommend to anyone who has a spiritual bent of mine, which is go to the um British Museum in London. Okay, it's important to go there because what they've done is they've collected statues vigor of deities from every possible ancient culture right from Byzantine to uh ours they have a whole India section to Chinese culture to New Zealand culture to African countries like it's extremely stimulating an experience. One of the things you notice there is that many of the statues almost all of them have broken noses including the sphinx in Egypt which is still you can't take the whole sphinx away but you can break its nose. So one of the British occultists that I spoke to said that this is an ancient technique to remove what we call chetana from a statue. Basically the pran of the statue goes away. It's like you're kind of killing off the statue's energy. And this basically the statues that were collected, all of them almost had broken noses. So there's clearly something might be there. Yeah, I went a little deeper into this study. And uh what many modern researchers on these subjects believe is that uh imperialists from that period which is 500 600 years ago knew how polytheistic societies work and knew these little elements like hey break the nose to remove the pran shaky of the statue. Uh take away the war gods from cultures um create divide and rule mentality within a culture. We had a nihangik leader recently on the show who was a specialist in chhatraya which is another kind of martial art that came out of India other than kaleri paiu and they believe that it's the extension of the same martial art which was used in the mahabharat. So they look at themselves as descendants of the sanatanis from back then. These are six nihang six who call themselves sanatanis. They said that we were categorically um stripped away from a vidya as in siki sikism was stripped away from chhatravidya because nihangik were becoming a big problem for British. Yeah in the 1800s and I think roughly in about 1870 something I can't remember the exact date. um the British applied divide and rule on the six to create one pro-sanati school which was headed by the Nihang six and the other one was anti-sanati which tried creating a drift between Hindus and six um all this is coming to the forefront now now in this whole essay that I said my conjecture is that I believe that scandupasa has been removed from our country very systematically to remove that little bit of war element to take out the edge from our land. That's my reading. And I might be wrong, but this is why in my heart, especially after going closer to Skull, I thank Tamil Nadu a lot. You've kept it alive and now it has its chance at regrowing throughout the country. Uh this whole essay is nothing to do with being anti-European, anti-imperialist, but it has everything to do with taking Bat back to its original culture of having a god of war which is very much needed in the current geopolitical scenario of our times. Do you agree with me, disagree with me about anything I said? Broadly agree with you. though I don't know uh because I have not uh I can't say I don't know because I can't say whether they were systematically removed or whether it was the uh you know the the way of time of Mahakala that it got removed for various reasons I don't know I can't say uh but yes of course there are when whenever there's a monotheistic culture that comes in contact with a polytheistic culture it causes a lot of damage to the vigraas and mortis we have seen that right from ancient times attacks on sumnat to other places and all that But leaving that aside, scandupasana is going to increase. There is no doubt about it. We need that energy. We need so bava first creates the base. Okay. Bava is the first dity. So that is precisely why uh the bhavadna the way it is picking up. For example, the next stage of the bhav sadhana comes di sadna and scandupasana. These are all parallel movements in sadena. What can you explain this? So first is there is a whole lot of people who are doing bavasana right and this is going to increase with time. It's not going to decrease. It's bavuasana also relegated itself to a sort of a you know a secondary position for the last thousand years at least. Uh before that he was a very prominent tantric deity across India. Uh and I would say that many of the practices related to Shiva that were there in specifically in parts of North India and Bengal were actually basically of Bhava and Mahakala rather than of Shiva specifically. Okay. So sometimes the difference is very thin. Even Bhava can be called as Shiva. But when you see the intensity of the practice when the data is being taken out in procession and the people the way they are behaving that that raw energy is there in Vava. Shiva is more milder when when he is Shiva same being is very mild. When is Vavva that aggressive energy is there. So we are seeing an upsurge of vavasana across India and it is going to increase automatically it will lead to dyasa. Automatically that will also lead to scandupasa. Scandupasana is set to come back again very strongly across India I feel and which is why the eight temples that I uh you know sort of plan to uh if Barava will sit of course Baba's with his with his consent and with his blessings it will have each of these will have a scandigraha apart from bhava there will be a dvi vigraha multiple bavas will be there there will be a dvi vigraha and there will also be a scandra inside it is absolutely important. There's a specific configuration in which this will come and that becomes a very very powerp packed center of energy. Okay. So, Scandanda is that clean warrior who immediately goes into battle straight. He's like that arrow quick. So, he's not going to wait for the enemy to come front and all that. Moment there's a threat, there's a battle, he will go straight into the war. That is that is the nature of the weapons he carries also. And in fact people would be very amazed to know that some of the old texts of uh Hinduism actually mentions that Mahisasura was some old texts in some versions of the story Misasura was killed by Scandanda. We know that Madura kills Mahisasura right but in some old text it's mentioned Scandinasura. So basically here is a deity who is chief purpose of birth was to defeat Assura's and enemies. is the absolute god of war and it takes the person into a frenzy frenzy scand even bava to some degree but scand more than that if you keep as one keeps doing scandupasana mantra sadana deeper goes deeper into sadhana it's like a possession of the soul that happens you'll feel that tremendous energy and you will have it's like the blinkers of a horse you will not think of anything just one singleointed aim whatever is that aim and it will get done and in higher upasana uh scandupasana happens in my opinion very well if one goes a little away from society sometimes very intense sadhana not saying everybody should do it most of the scandopasana that happens today large part of it is more of bi oriented scandopasa which is also good but the hardcore bantraasa scand it's good to do if someone is a little away from society in a forested area it's in seclusion okay and the six is so crucial there are certain priyoggas and sadhanavadascanda six days one has to do it completely cut off from people and it takes hours to sit and do if it's correctly done by the sixth day you'll see results and unfailing results he is that I I remember once I was doing a scandup and out of the blue this peacock started coming there in that area so he literally is the god who goes he's the general so he will lead from the front he doesn't wait till the battle has come to him he just leads from the front and um the other thing about scandupasana that happens is that it increases uh it makes a very sharp mind in the sense that strong ability for arguments it gives to noasa person if you put a scandop basa genuine one see a lot of people have bias on scand I'm talking somebody who has attained the blessing of scanda properly his mind will become so sharp put him into an argument that same ferocity same ability to attack same ability to uh you know fight comes even in that mind also so any argument that is putt. Tand is a master of logic. is a master of logic and he can give such terrific logical mind to an individual that whatever you put he will be able to do kandana which is he will be able to deconstruct that argument very easily with the least effort if he has blessings of scandal that's another thing scand is very good for children by the way protection of children in tamil he's the the god for everything but I'm saying that not just tamil people I mean for other people also and you're right that I'm I'm we all should be grateful to people from tamiladu that scandup in whatever format. Maybe the ancient ways in which kandopasana used to happen with hardcore practices that has reduced more into a bacti based upasana today which is also okay at least there is the the the trend of the upasana is still there which is very wonderful but a time will come I feel when scand will become panindia god and not just panindia god he will a primary dity because we are also entering in very tough times from uh from this year to the next few years is going to be wars and lot of things will happen. You will need the blessings of very aggressive daties. You will need the blessings of VA. You'll need the blessings of Scandanda. You'll need the blessings of some very fierce feminine daties. They are again going to awaken and reactivate and reactivate and they give you the power to pass through difficult times. Felt it. Yes. But difficult times means that you also have the that's what I say then when a when a god gives you a difficult time it means that he thinks that you have potential. Um your video on behaviors is one of the most iconic videos that's ever come out of Indian YouTube when it comes to rebooting tantra in our culture. Are we even allowed to give out a very basic scandasa? Yes. So I I asked the people who follow me I asked them to do on shashi titis uh on the on the on the bright fourth night of the moon shuklabaka shashi sixth dity of that is specifically dedicated to scandha so so after full moon after full so when there's the bright phase of the moon there's the dark phase of the moon krishna waning and wax yes so you can these list you can find on the online Google or any of the panchchang will tell you that so sixth of that is specifically dedicated to scand okay. So on that day I tell people those who follow my spiritual advices to light at least one dya have a picture of scanda or light oney and then sit and do this kand ashtarama ashtra means 108 names of scand it's very easily available these days on the internet again thanks to Google see these are easier in a way technology has made some things easier 100 years ago these things were not available to people it is only available to the specific gurus or the temples or the sradas and in order to know These 108 names also you have to go to them take initiation and things like that. But nature has created a system whether we like it or not is irrelevant and it's not going to go back. All the texts are in the open today. Everybody can read and this is it's not going to go back. It's going to be from here. This is the reality. Nature has caused this reality to happen. So there must be some reason for it. So let's make the best use of it. That's my way of looking at it. Of course not everything can be done from text but there are a lot of things that can be done. There's no problem in it. So the ashtoama the 108 names of scand read that read that six times read that 10 times just light wanda put some nayam or some food or bh we call it or some offering of food little bit something sweet is very good to give offer to him some fruits some sweet something like that in front oney and that chant that if if somebody is serious about it then start chanting it at least 12 times okay the 108 names you keep doing that for some period few months you will start experiencing the impact of scandopasana and this is like the beginning stages higher stages so there are things like uh you know there are priogas of scandanda which is the satu samahara prioga they call it destruction of enemies six day pyoga that happens there are specific pujas that can happen but all that is more later stage what about people who have a rudra mala at home and are doing bhav upasana in the same way that omhavayama is a mantra that we can give out to people. Is there anything? There is a mantra but uh I will not give it out until I've actually I mean of course in the internet you can find lot of mantras but uh until I have contemplated a bit more on that uh but at this moment see if you want to connect to scanda then the astra nama is very good. Ashtra is nothing but the names of scand which is also there you'll find scandai like this. Okay, various names are there. Okay. What if you just pick up one and start doing? You can you can but you have to be a little careful that you choose the right name. Some guidance may be required in that. That is why whereas if you do the whole 108 names that creates a more uh comprehensive energy. Okay. Okay. One more extended question. Okay. because we've done so many episodes on Dvi upasa and behava. The way I explain in upasna and tantra to any of my friends who are not aware of these subjects is that I tell them that think that you're doing chemistry with reality. You're doing some kind of chemical reactions with reality through mantras. That's how powerful mantras are. But you need to be guided in terms of which mantras mix with which other mantras and which ones you shouldn't do and uh the different proportions of each one. I believe that it's not wise to jump from one dity to another completely etc. Is that a correct pattern of thinking or maybe I want to reframe my question in terms of how do you know whether you should do bhraasa? So that is to find out which dity upasana you have to do there are two three methods one is that first the basic is that if you have a uh if you have a liking for a specific deity you can start off that way or if there's a specific deity who's woripped uh in your family you can start of that dity or if you have a guru who specifically tells you you worship this dity or the last is if you look at the horoscope of an individual you can get some idea about what dity is suitable for the individual and the last is if there is a problem going on in life and you want a solution to that problem then it can be some dity that may or may not be a primary dity. It could be something you have to do temporarily for 6 months or a year or something like that. That's also possible. So all in all uh first thing is that can multiple daties be woripped? Yes, it can be woripped. There's no problem in that. Uh you may have ba as your primary dity along with it you can worship some form of Dvi, you can worship worship scand gpati. It depends on what is it that you want. Finally why are you woriing these daties. So there is yeah how about creating a sad which is effectively the whole shivshaki family. Yes. So that's precisely what I ask people to do in the uh through the telegram groups that my team runs. So we there's a vavas we do on okay there is a daasana we do onashtami that is the bright fortnite oft we do on the dark fortnite. Okay. On shashi there's a scanduana. On chhaturup dashi we do a matarasana. These are the four daties I ask people to carry on doing every month. four days a month specific intense more intense sadena of these daties and otherwise on the on an average nity upasana which is daily upasana a little less amount of these daties are done but this creates a very comprehensive force and given and for anybody who follows what I am saying these are the daties who have had a central role in my own sadhana and the uh in the driving of the organization that I'm leading right now so therefore anybody who wants to connect to me has also to connect to these datas So there it already becomes a very comprehensive force. There's kandanda, there is bhava even bava there is a ka in which stages. So you start with bhavva then after a point um you go to vahava you go to kala like this various things scanda is there matara is there madura is there so this becomes a very comprehensive sort of a package but in general uh uh the idea is that there is no harm in worshiing multiple daties. By the way in polytheistic cultures everybody worships multiple daties but you have one central dity you like more. Say you like bhava more. So what you do is that your sadhana may suppose bhav is a central dity it starts with bhava first. Okay. And you do a substantial amount of the bav mantra japa or whatever then you go do a little bit of dyu basana suppose then suppose you're doing gpati depends on the person to person and some amount of scand and once the whole thing is completed for the day when you're doing nityasana the last tupasana also last end of the day you again do a little bit of pranam suppose he's the main dity end the day with the pranam and say that actually all the daties are your own consciousness M one has become many many has become one. Would you like to end the episode by talking about the upcoming 5 years? It's going to be tough for everybody and uh lot of things that we imagined or taken for granted will change. We might go through crisis situations in India specifically. There could be wars but look at it as a stage of deep cleaning that will be done by the daties and people we may also lose lot of people by the way that is another possibility I see that people you have things you have taken for granted or people you have taken for granted suddenly some things happen that is also one chance is there there's a possibility of there but fundamentally this is a time when spiritually you can grow much faster see it's the whole uh common knowledge in history is that only in times of crisis you make the fastest progress spiritually. When things are very good, you will not make progress. Even the the whole point why the gods the great gods the mortis and the shivas shaki and others they have created the assuras. What was the need of assuras in the first place? Just the gods would have been enough. But if the gods were only there, they would never change. They would be static where they are. You would be static where you are. Without change means friction. First there has to be friction. Friction will cause change. Movement. Otherwise everything remains static means you are permanently fixed in wherever you are. You have no chance of growing beyond the human condition. It's because there is conflict. There is going to be stress. So you have the chance to apply yourself more strongly and through that redeem yourself and grow higher faster. It's been a tough five years already. It's it may become tougher financially uh in terms of uh there could be some kind of crisis that may happen. there could be natural calamities and definitely there will be wars and uh even in our neighborhoods. So basically at the end of the day what I am very sanguin about is that people plus India itself will undergo a change in the graas in this year itself and that will make things more tougher in some senses. So for people do more sadena of fierce forms like bava do more sadhana of di do more sadha of scandanda but behav definitely he's his time is here right now he's the most active of all the forms would you say for vashnavites that they should dive into nursing yeah I mean that's up to them what their is but uh upasan is very good he's in fact considered as is is almost like a rdra in some of the interestingly one of the ashtra namas of Narasima 108 names of Lord Narasima describes him as bhava-ike sometimes okay that ferocity is there that extreme amount of power and aggression and there is a corresponding form of bhava that's also linked to narma which is the survwara which is the the story goes that when he could not calm down then Shiva first sent vidadra to calm Narasima down but nar calm down then there was the uh there's a form of Shiva very peculiar form with eight legs okay and wings and the body of a a bird and a animal uh who's known as survveshwara is one of the akash bava is very fierce from a bhava extremely fierce his mantras are for destruction of enemies and removing black magic very good and very potent in that sense along with him comes the force of pratanga and shuli nidorga two very fierce forms of dvi. So basically again in south India his zupasana is there are temples where zupasana happens and his mantra sadnas are there for removal of negatives and things like that. So basically yeah for a vishnava if he wants to do more aggressive form of sadena I guess nar sadha will be good but I don't want so it's not about just doing an aggressive form there are certain deities who are going to awaken very strongly as we have seen like vava it's already there it's going to happen it's already happening it's not going to change it's not about uh just randomly picking something no it doesn't work that way it is what they will it if they if it has been willed has decided that he's going to awaken reawake himself spring up everywhere in India and reawaken consciousness of the people then it is his will he will come so I have seen and I've had cases where I have males from Vishnavas also have started doing varad I mean they have tried experimented a few times with a few malas and then it gelled with them so automatically it went up they may not be telling people but I get males so that's why I know in the old world from the last thousand years or before that as I think conversations about omens were much more prevalent than they are now likely. Yes. You know, in just the last month, uh I don't know if you've read about all these deep sea creatures coming to the surface and now fish washed up on the shores of Kerala. Right. Right. There was a blood moon in I think the last few weeks. Um these were all the signs that would count as omens in the old world. Is there any heed one should pay to this? Uh perhaps perhaps we will pass through some difficult times. Perhaps we must find and it has already started off but it will go on for a few years at least but this is also a period of churning through this lot of strength inner strength will be found. It's like India will pass through a phase of crisis. Okay. Maybe the whole world but India definitely and in that phase the amount of faith and the amount of strength you have in your upasa is what is going to see you through. You means you me everybody all of us through. So yeah these omens can very well indicate uh that maybe we'll have a massive natural calamity. In any case, there's a shift of grahas that are happening uh for the next two months in fact two two and a half months where there will be six grahas or and Saturn and Rahu will enter into Mina Rashi and just even basic commerce somebody who has basic understanding of jotisha will agree Mina is a rashi related to water signs. So there could be some water related natural calamity possible maybe a tsunami maybe an earthquake under sea that causes a terrific effect outside something like that it's possible. Yeah.
