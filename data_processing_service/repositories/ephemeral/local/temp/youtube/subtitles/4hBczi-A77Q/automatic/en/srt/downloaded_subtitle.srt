1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,120
Rajashi Nandi is back on TRS. They say

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,760
that this is the era where Scand the

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,040
Hindu god of war returns to the

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,160
mainstream across India and across the

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,640
whole globe. The deity called Scando

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,119
Kartaka is waking up once again. It's a

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,519
very misunderstood and misrepresented

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,320
subject from the realms of Sanatan

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,199
Dharm. And that's the gap that we hope

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,239
to bridge alongside India's premier

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,870
tantra expert Rajasi Nandi who returns

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:49,459
on the Radi show.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:49,459
[Music]

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,760
Jaba

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,440
Jakam Jaba Jakatara Jat

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,799
going to begin this conversation

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,720
straight up. I have this one doubt which

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,479
I've not been able to understand

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,200
completely or been able to explain it to

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,720
people who've asked me the same doubt.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
When we talk about the concept of Shiv

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,479
Shaki

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,280
most M Sanad visualize Shiv Gi married

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,320
to Parvatima and then they have two

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,159
children Gpati and Scand correct uh

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,560
this whole question is going to lead

27
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,640
itself to Scand okay but first I'd like

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
to know about Shiv Shaki a little bit I

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,200
think most sanatanis at this point know

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,720
the story of Sati right uh and then

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,479
Parvatima right that that is shown to us

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,439
in television shows etc.

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,880
Now before the birth of Gpati when they

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,360
they were just living as husband and

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,479
wife Shiv and Parvati

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,479
can I look at Kalima

37
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,960
being equivalent of the Parvati that was

38
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,960
married to Shiv G before Gpati was

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,119
created or how am I supposed to look at

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
Kalima with respect to Shiv Shaki? Is

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,799
she even related? Okay. Or is it a whole

42
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,080
other dity?

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,480
So very good question actually. uh Shiva

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,720
and Shaki are the primordial

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,440
beings of the universe the way and I

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,480
will explain this not just from whatever

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,239
is the texts and all but more from the

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,400
way I look at it so it's easier to

49
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,800
explain to me what is my reality or how

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,160
do I equate with them so Shiva and Shi

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,920
fundamentally are the uh everything in

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,879
the universe is either Shiva or Shaki or

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,120
sometimes a mix of both also right and

54
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,840
the easiest way to understand this is

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,319
there is one ultimate reality call it

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,879
Brahman whatever else. So that reality

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:49,680
has two uh segments or two two

58
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,800
divisions. One division is static okay

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,879
static means it does not move. It is in

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
absolute knowledge. Okay. It sees

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,360
everything the allseeing eye sort of and

62
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,680
is attached to nothing. Okay. It is in

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,000
deep wisdom and knowledge but it is

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,720
nonattached to anything else. Let us say

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,200
that this specific aspect of the Brahman

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,360
we call it as Shiva. And then there is

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,319
the other aspect which is the executive

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,319
power. The ability to do things. Okay.

69
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,280
Not just wisdom. Along with that there

70
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,959
is karma. There's ka activity. There is

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,760
something there's a force. There's an

72
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,640
agency to cause events to happen

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,680
creation to come into existence. That

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,000
creative force that executive power is

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,319
shy. Together these two have formed it's

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,239
one being in two different poises.

77
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,400
Poises means two ways of looking at the

78
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,879
same two different activities attributes

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,799
it's doing. So if there was only the

80
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,799
static aspect of the Brahman of only

81
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,480
Shiva was there then there would be no

82
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
need for a creation. In fact that is

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,000
what the stories tell us in the puranas.

84
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,920
For a long time there was no creation at

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
all because he was in deep samadi. And

86
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,120
then there was assuras and they were

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
troubling and things like that. And the

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,480
god said that only a son born from Shiva

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,120
or a child born from him can uh you know

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,959
defeat this negative thing. So basically

91
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,799
Shiva is in samadhi. He's not interested

92
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,560
in the world anyway. He's beyond the

93
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,799
world. He's completely transcendental.

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,199
But there is a part of Shiva his own

95
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,079
projection for example which is his

96
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,479
creative power his shi

97
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,639
which creates the world which has made

98
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,360
the world from the highest gods to the

99
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,360
to the most inscentient the most uh say

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,880
the stone on the road that is also a

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,720
product of the shi the human being is a

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,560
product of shy everything is a product

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,600
of shaky and this shi is a projection of

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,360
shiva so this is the two ultimate

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,479
polarities of the universe we you me

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,120
everybody we are in a world of shy

107
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,960
completely everything is shaky. Okay.

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
However, there are all types of shakis.

109
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,400
There is vidya shaky, there's aidy

110
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,400
shaky, there is positive shaky, there's

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,960
negative shaky. Assuras are shakis.

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,720
Whereas gods are shakis. Good qualities

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,360
are shakis. Bad qualities are also

114
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
shakis. So we have to be discrim. We

115
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,880
have to discriminate between all this.

116
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,440
What is it we want? What is it we don't

117
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,680
want which helps us accordingly? We do

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
spiritual practices that helps us to

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,160
choose the things that will help us to

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,919
grow further because if you if somebody

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
pursues the avid shakis they will fall

122
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,919
down and fall down and eventually be

123
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,560
completely destroyed and in more painful

124
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,960
conditions larger periods of time. So

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,759
these are the two main fundamental

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,320
aspects of reality. Shi has created the

127
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,800
whole world and this shi we call as

128
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,960
parvati at the initial stages when she's

129
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,720
married to Shiva. Okay. Where the shi is

130
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,440
very pliant to Shiva. like a very

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
faithful wife, okay, who's uh looking

132
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,759
after the all that is needed for the

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,479
husband and things like that. So that is

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,000
a very shy which is more demure in

135
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,960
nature and highly dedicated to the very

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,280
static transcendental lord Shiva that

137
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,600
Kali is also shaky but slightly

138
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,840
different. She is a very dynamic

139
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
outpouring from Parvati. Let's put it

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
this way. There's one shaky sometimes

141
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
she's Parvati. Sometimes she's Kali.

142
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,600
Sometimes from Kali she becomes all the

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,560
10 mahavidyas. She can be various things

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,960
as Kali she is her story is different.

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,120
So she is a out andout goddess for

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
destruction of negatives in Assuras and

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
not just negatives in the world outside

148
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,560
sometimes negatives within us. Okay. So

149
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,240
that aspect of Kali is so fierce and so

150
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
powerful that she's uh when she comes

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
into a battle she's almost unstoppable

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,039
even by the gods.

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,160
To summarize what you said and please

154
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,479
correct me where you think I've

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
understood it wrong. When we talk about

156
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,479
reality of the universe around us, it

157
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,880
can be understood as being of two parts.

158
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,360
There is pure stillness, right? Which

159
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,680
can be understood to be Shiva and then

160
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,440
there's the other side which is all the

161
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,960
energy, all the power of the universe

162
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,840
which can be understood to be shy.

163
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,319
Correct? And together as Shiva and

164
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,000
Parvati or Shiv Shaki, they constitute

165
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,479
the universe. That is what the fabric of

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,240
reality is made of. Right. Right. Now

167
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,479
simply that shy because it's raw energy,

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,520
it can mold itself into many different

169
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,360
kinds of energy. Correct. Absolutely.

170
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,560
And those different kinds of energy are

171
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
what we call the different types of

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,199
shaki. So all the divine feminine

173
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
aspects of energy that we worship in

174
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,400
sanata. Correct.

175
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,840
Now out of all these versions of shi

176
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,280
there are certain ones that we worship

177
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:32,080
as a goddess. So it can be understood

178
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:35,280
from this whole paragraph that uh shi or

179
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,039
parvatima can take up different roles in

180
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,039
the universe for different purposes.

181
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,440
Right? And one of those highly ferocious

182
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,720
roles is the role of kali. Correct? And

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,520
then eventually she goes back to being

184
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
bati. No. So the beauty the play of the

185
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,720
gods we call it leela. Okay. Leela is a

186
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,680
play. Uh play of the gods is that once

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,080
so maali is herself like an independent

188
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,319
deity. Okay. So not just her all the

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,000
dust mahavidas are independent deities

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,599
independent forms of shi and once they

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,120
come into existence they will remain

192
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,280
there they will always be there

193
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,840
interacting with upasakas or doing some

194
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,319
things in the world of creation etc. But

195
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,560
my point is all this anybody who has

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,800
movement shi is movement and nothing

197
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
else. When you move there is always a

198
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
change. So basic idea is there's a

199
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,680
change of pressure there's a change of

200
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,080
force that happens right there's a

201
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,759
momentum. Right? Now think about it this

202
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,479
way. We are sitting in this room, right?

203
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,080
This room is on placed on planet earth.

204
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,280
Earth is moving around the sun. The

205
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,039
earth and sun are moving around

206
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,440
something else. Okay? That something is

207
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,279
moving around another greater circle. So

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
there is constant movement going on

209
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,440
layers and layers inter layers of

210
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,519
movement. This whole movement is shy.

211
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,680
And the point and this is a very

212
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,080
interesting thing. All shy revolves

213
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,160
around the point of stillness relative

214
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,240
to itself. It's very important to

215
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,000
understand that. So Shiva is like the

216
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
earth for example is moving around the

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,920
sun. So sun is

218
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,399
for uh let's approximately saying not

219
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,240
scientifically saying so approximately

220
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,720
let's say that the sun is the center of

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,000
the solar system right so sun becomes

222
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,600
relatively like shiva and the grahas are

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,760
different forms of shakis moving around

224
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,519
earth is one shaky the moon is one shaky

225
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,040
like that okay so wherever there's

226
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
movement there is also a point of

227
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
stillness relative to that movement now

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,760
this whole arrangement of the sun and

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,240
the solar system is also moving around

230
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,519
some other center that center is the

231
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,320
Shiva of this whole movement. So Shiva

232
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,240
is that stillness is not a point it is a

233
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
depth of stillness. What degree of

234
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,040
stillness? If you if you take a man into

235
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,560
a position where absolute stillness we

236
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
don't have stillness inside us. Why?

237
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,519
That's because there's sound. There's

238
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,680
you are sitting here there's some

239
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,640
ambient noise something like that. Your

240
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,040
senses give you an idea of the

241
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,320
approximate location of other things.

242
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,800
There's some vibration that you are

243
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,120
catching. Right? If you were to cut off

244
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,959
everything absolutely still, it can

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,880
cause a lot of disorientation in the

246
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,720
mind. That is stillness because your

247
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,040
mind is not able to fathom what is

248
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,200
there. In absolute stillness, a person

249
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,800
can go absolutely mad also unless the

250
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,560
Aadhaar the mind and the body has the

251
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,920
capacity to take it. That is why sadha

252
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,040
has to be done. So yes, Parvati Garvati

253
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,600
is a is the devoted shi of Shiva whereas

254
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,839
the form of Kali and others, she has

255
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,399
different functions in the universe.

256
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,200
She's also the upasia dvata of tantra in

257
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,519
in in sadhana in tantra sadhana or even

258
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,760
without tandra sadha also she is a ishta

259
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,600
devi of many people across India

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,880
especially eastern India and also other

261
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,880
parts of India. Okay now we have to move

262
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
to the actual core of the topic I'm

263
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,519
trying to get to which is what we

264
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,800
planned for this episode which is

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,320
kartika or scand. Yes the dity that I

266
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,160
feel a deep connection with. It's a dity

267
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
that you feel a deep connection with.

268
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
It's a dity that many people in Tamil

269
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,720
Nadu feel a deep connection with. Why

270
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,399
not Bengal and New Delhi and Punjab and

271
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
Maharashtra?

272
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
So not just Tamil Nadu I think even

273
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,519
Kerala and many other in the southern

274
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
states also there are some influence of

275
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,200
Scandanda or Subramani or Kartik. Coming

276
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,800
to this question why not Bengal? So at

277
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,440
least till the time of say the 8th 9th

278
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,519
century uh there is good evidence from

279
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,000
sculptures and other things that scandha

280
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,240
upasana was very popular across India

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,720
not just Tamil Nadu it was he was a

282
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,959
primary deity who used to worship uh at

283
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,640
that time India extended earlier India

284
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,680
extended to include central Asia

285
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,720
Afghanistan those areas so from that

286
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,800
area till Bengal there used to be many

287
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,880
various sculptures and things related to

288
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,200
scandha that we have disced covered. So

289
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
we can very safely conclude that he was

290
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,279
a panindia deity. We used to worship

291
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,279
everybody used to worship in Bengal in

292
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,279
north Bengal there are areas right now

293
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,760
though it's that area is nothing but

294
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,079
where uh there was a reference to a huge

295
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,600
kanda temple and that references is

296
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,240
found in texts in Kashmir Kashmir uh you

297
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,160
know scholars and not today's scholars

298
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,079
scholars of the you know that 9th 10th

299
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,320
century they referred to a great scanda

300
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,320
temple in north Bengal there is uh in

301
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
south Bengal also there were the trader

302
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,920
communities who used to worship scanda

303
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,440
there were places where tribals used to

304
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
worship scanda We used to call him

305
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,519
Kartika. This same dity. The iconography

306
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,320
are slight differences but otherwise

307
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,639
same effectively represented by holding

308
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,639
a spear. Huh. So I in Bengal side when

309
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
we worship Kartika he's even now Kartik

310
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,440
puja happens in Bengal by the way in the

311
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,360
village areas and all that. It's quite

312
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
popular in certain cities it's popular.

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,720
It's a remnant from that time. Uh he

314
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,639
holds a bow and arrow in in Bengal.

315
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,160
Bengal. Yeah. Uh he holds a bow and

316
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
arrow but the peacock is there as the

317
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,880
vahana. And uh see there are two

318
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,000
similarities between the weapons. He

319
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,600
holds a bow and arrow. And in South

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,920
India he holds what is called the veil.

321
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,160
Okay? Like a spear. Both of them are

322
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,240
weapons that are to be shot. They they

323
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
work from a distance right? You don't

324
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
have to shoot come close to somebody to

325
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
shoot. You can shoot from a distance. So

326
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,760
basically the indication is that his

327
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,600
power is so swift that it will work.

328
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,079
Distance doesn't matter. So he need not

329
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,160
uh be physically right next to you when

330
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,079
he's protecting an upasa even before the

331
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
problem actually comes from a distance

332
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,680
he can actually neutralize that that is

333
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,079
his power and this knowledge by the way

334
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,399
I will not go details into it but this

335
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,959
knowledge of the the iconography of the

336
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,040
astras the weapons of the deities and

337
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,160
their consecutive consequent mantras in

338
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,680
the upasana is the peak of mantra sadena

339
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,680
there are ways in which the astras of

340
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,399
dvatas can be activated Whether it's

341
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,200
maali, whether it's tara, whether it's

342
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,800
kanda, whether it's the trishula, there

343
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,720
are ways to activate that. There mantra

344
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,079
sadas, a complicated process. It's not

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,839
so easy and it's not meant for

346
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,000
everybody. What do you mean activate? Uh

347
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,360
then the astra is the ultimate of mantra

348
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,120
shastra means basically it is just like

349
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I had mentioned before also that we

350
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,920
consider the dvata as same as the

351
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,079
mantra. So each of these weapons also

352
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,720
have their own mantras and there's a

353
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,880
process to activate that. And the third

354
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,519
thing about the mantras of the dvatas of

355
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,519
the of the astras is that they are very

356
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,279
sharp. That's why they called astras. So

357
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,360
they are weapons. Once you activate

358
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,680
them, they will show a result. Now if

359
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,519
the person who activated that astra is

360
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
not steady enough, it can cause some

361
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,839
damage to the person also who is trying

362
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,680
to act. Yes. Because it's a weapon at

363
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,120
the end of the day. So who can control

364
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,560
the weapon? Only the dity can control

365
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
the weapon. Nobody else can control an

366
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,399
astra. So this concept is there in the

367
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,519
mandra shastras. Even today there are

368
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,440
people who worship the veil of scandal

369
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,920
specifically. In fact the veil that is

370
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,839
there of scand in south is considered to

371
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
be equivalent to scand himself. You mean

372
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,160
the spear right? Spear. So you can have

373
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,839
the sphere and you can do puja of this

374
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,079
sphere and that is as good as having

375
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,959
kartika with you. Okay. There a lot of

376
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,040
people do that. In fact, I myself uh

377
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,760
have a veil which I carry wherever I'm

378
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,240
going and suppose I have to go to see

379
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,600
for any work. I'm staying in a hotel or

380
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,519
something. First thing I'll do is that

381
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,959
I'll place this the veil there and do a

382
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,560
little bit namaskcara with certain

383
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,959
mantras. Basically, it clears the area

384
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,360
of all negatives. The veil has that kind

385
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,360
of power. So Kartika

386
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,199
the beautiful thing about Lord Kartika

387
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,240
is that first of all he was popular

388
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,320
across India and uh in some references

389
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,639
uh long back it's again I'm talking

390
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,639
about 8 9th century those time he was

391
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,040
very popular in the areas that we have

392
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,639
today like hana and those places

393
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,079
extremely popular okay uh that uh and

394
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,720
the worship of kartika does another

395
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,199
thing it brings a steady power of Mars

396
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,320
in fact the brihyat parasa horastra

397
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,160
which is a text on jotisha very old text

398
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,639
mentions that when there are problems of

399
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
Mars you worship Kartika okay you mean

400
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,079
energy levels energy levels so he is

401
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,959
more he's a dity you can control Mars

402
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,360
okay so any issues with Mars can be

403
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,120
controlled by Kartika what are issues

404
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,199
with Mars like anything for example

405
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,839
injuries are happening blood related

406
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,839
problems land related issues fights

407
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,240
conflicts so Mars is also known as

408
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,920
mongal mongal means good right so when

409
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,079
mars is positive It will make somebody

410
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,240
feel good about the environment. Mars is

411
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,399
very important in say relationships for

412
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,040
example fights or the lack of fights

413
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,920
whatever uh injuries any kind of

414
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,639
warfare. So Kartika is a deity who

415
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,240
Kartika is the general of the gods.

416
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,639
Remember that his birth is very

417
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,639
beautiful. When the gods could not find

418
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,399
a way to destroy an assura they

419
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,079
worshiped Shiva and it was the prophecy

420
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,759
was that only Shiva has a child. there

421
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,040
and only that child will be able to

422
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,120
destroy that assura and then from Shiva

423
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,320
came birth of Kartika happens and the

424
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,040
story is like this that uh the ura the

425
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,000
the vidya of Shiva the seaman of Shiva

426
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,000
it it's believed that when the vira of

427
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,759
Shiva uh came out it was taken by it it

428
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,680
fell because it was there was so much

429
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,519
power in it was it was like a burning

430
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,600
hot thing because remember that the

431
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,079
daties do not have physical body these

432
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
are stories to tell you a a lesson

433
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,120
deeper lesson. A dity doesn't have

434
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,199
physical body like you and me. So you

435
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,039
may ask that what exactly does it mean?

436
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,559
We come to that part later. But the

437
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,480
story goes that the vidya was so

438
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,000
powerful that it fell in the waters. The

439
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,919
water could not carry it. It fell into

440
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,039
fire. Fire could not carry it. It's so

441
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,640
hot so powerful. And then it was taken

442
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,959
up by a it fell in a reed in in a forest

443
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,240
small forest of bushes of bushy leaves

444
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,679
and all that. Those leaves that forested

445
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,520
area that's called the sharavana.

446
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,760
Saravana means somebody who's born out

447
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
of those leaves in that and then at that

448
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,480
time there were six matrias very fierce

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,880
deities in the sky which are connected

450
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,120
to the nakshhatra called kitika. Kitika

451
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,280
is a nakhatra in the zodiac. Then

452
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,440
nakshhatra has six stars. These six

453
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,240
stars are like six matrias very fierce

454
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,320
women. Okay. They came down and nursed

455
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,480
that baby. So each of them nursed. So

456
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,880
there were like six parts of that vidya

457
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,960
and they uh it started growing growing

458
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,960
growing and it had six heads. Eventually

459
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,280
when it grew up then Parvati came and

460
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,120
hold all of them together and those six

461
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,840
come together. So therefore the number

462
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,880
six has a strong connection to Kartika

463
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,080
and in jotica six is the house of

464
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,440
conflicts of war. So he here is a being

465
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,600
who a god of war and in this story he's

466
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,840
born entirely from the vir of Shiva. So

467
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,520
he doesn't pass through the womb. There

468
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,200
is no point where he's passing through

469
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,600
the womb and developing. So there's a

470
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,679
moral to this story and then once he

471
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,360
goes up grows up he becomes so powerful

472
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,039
that first of all Indra gets scared

473
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,400
because he's able to defeat anybody

474
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,919
there's nobody who can defeat him so

475
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,919
powerful and then he goes into fight

476
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,559
with the gods and as he's fighting with

477
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,559
the daties at the assuras multiple times

478
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,600
he's fighting different times at the end

479
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,919
there's a six- day war that happens

480
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,799
and before the last day Parvati gives

481
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,799
him the veil the astra using that he's

482
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,240
able to defeat the assuras okay that

483
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:01,840
veil So here is a deity whose whole body

484
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,600
is of the entire masculine energy. There

485
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,360
is no other god in our pantheon whose

486
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,520
whole formation has only masculine

487
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,480
energy. It's only gartika. Okay.

488
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,039
Absolutely raw power of Mars. Raw power

489
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,200
of Mars from top to bottom. Only shi

490
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,320
that he carries is the ve through which

491
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,160
he destroys the assuras. Okay. And he's

492
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,280
the general of the gods. What does a

493
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,760
general mean? So we can say that um uh

494
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,440
there are so many warrior gods in our we

495
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,280
worship right? Hanumanji is a warrior

496
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,679
god. So many other gods are there. Vera

497
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,200
is also warrior in some sense. But the

498
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
interesting thing about kartika is that

499
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,320
we call in the general of the gods.

500
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,320
Being a general means you have the

501
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,320
ability to

502
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,400
strategize various things. You can use

503
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,799
multiple astras. You can use multiple

504
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,880
things to attack. That is the that is

505
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,200
the beauty of the general. Okay. Whereas

506
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,559
a specific dity will have its say Mali

507
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,640
has her direct contact of attack and I'm

508
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,400
just as a way of explaining I'm saying

509
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,240
okay not to take it literally in that

510
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,640
sense but it gives a spiritual insight

511
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,919
of what it meant whereas a general means

512
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,400
that he has in his uh disposal at his

513
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,960
disposal the weapons of all the gods

514
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,760
because he's the leader of the army okay

515
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,039
and then uh there are there's another

516
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,240
aspect of scand which is that when he is

517
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,400
not carrying the veil or the bow and

518
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,559
arrow that he has in Bengal side that we

519
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,200
do. So that time he's an entirely

520
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,440
a deity as I said as completely uh

521
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
purusha

522
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,600
purusha is the masculine energy when we

523
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
use the word masculine we automatically

524
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,760
in the western sense of the word is

525
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,520
somebody who's like you know maybe six

526
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,520
pack abs and doing this and that no it's

527
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,280
not masculine in that that sense because

528
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,600
remember they don't have a physical body

529
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,080
it's masculine in the head okay in that

530
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,440
strength and the determination so once

531
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,360
is determined that this has to be done

532
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,159
it will be done nobody in the

533
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,679
in the 14 universes can stop him. That

534
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,600
strength and determination is considered

535
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,600
to be a masculine quality in the

536
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,120
spiritual sense.

537
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,720
Second thing is uh

538
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,400
as I mentioned right now Shiva and

539
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,960
Shaki. So he is the son of Shiva who is

540
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,159
it's as if literally he is the son of

541
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,880
only Shiva. The purusha is so prominent

542
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,520
in him. So he enters without the veil he

543
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
becomes a guru. Okay. He becomes a guru

544
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,880
means he enters into the state of

545
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,520
samadhi

546
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,679
and he becomes known as gua. Guha is the

547
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,679
cave dweller. The cave is where inside

548
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,440
the human heart. So he goes inside his

549
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,440
states enters into a state of adwam.

550
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
Adwatam is the when all realization of

551
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,720
the brahman becomes prevalent to the

552
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,799
person and the static force of the

553
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,120
universe which I called Shiva right now

554
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,640
that he realizes very quickly and he

555
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,159
enters into that state and he can give

556
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,480
up. He goes so high so deepish means he

557
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,640
he acquires the ability to give the

558
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,400
advice of the prava even to lord Shiva

559
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,240
who is his father okay but

560
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
just to complete this when he holds the

561
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,679
veil that is when he goes out and fights

562
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
so either he's a guru when he's sitting

563
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,039
in the depth of the heart when he's

564
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,720
become gua or he's the warrior per

565
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,280
excellence

566
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,880
how is he different from Shiva if it was

567
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,240
only Shiva's masculine energy that

568
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,520
created Yes, that's because

569
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,080
Shiva is vast. Okay, Shiva encompasses

570
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,840
everything. Shiva

571
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,559
encompasses even those states which are

572
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:35,280
not uh uh let's say that those states of

573
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,600
spirituality which is inaccessible to

574
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,400
human beings even that is Shiva. There's

575
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,200
a vastness about Shiva. Okay, absolute

576
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,039
subtle, very subtle, very vast and also

577
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,880
transcendental. Remember that a large

578
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,520
part of Shiva is transcendental.

579
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,799
Paramasha or Parasa which is not even in

580
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
creation. He's not interested in the

581
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,480
creation. He's beyond the creation. We

582
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,559
cannot even imagine what he is. Forget

583
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,559
about any mantras all that comes later.

584
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,200
We can't imagine what this being is.

585
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,039
Okay. But Kartika is a child of Sha

586
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
which means a portion of his energy who

587
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,039
has that masculine energies directly

588
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
come down here. He is inside creation.

589
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,120
The second thing about Kartika just like

590
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,880
Bhava is that his energy is very easy to

591
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,360
access. Shiva is very difficult to

592
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,000
access relatively speaking. Of course if

593
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,080
somebody has purja samscara may get to

594
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,640
shiva quickly that's one of cases can

595
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,400
happen but Shiva is so subtle that's not

596
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,919
easy kartika on the other hand is very

597
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
connected to the earth to this physical

598
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,120
manifestation plane that is in

599
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,520
corresponding to kartika look at it so

600
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,360
beautifully done is gpati gapati's

601
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,559
creation story is that it is he is made

602
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,640
entirely from parvati and only the head

603
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,919
is that what shiva puts o okay that was

604
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,440
going to be a question I was going to

605
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,480
ask what's The difference between the

606
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,120
two brothers. Let's expand this. Yeah.

607
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,799
So this this is fundamentally at the end

608
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
of the day these are two paths of

609
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,720
spirituality. Okay. One is the path of

610
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,480
scand and one is the path of gpati. The

611
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,440
path of gpati uh is a little bit more

612
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,600
intuitive because he is fully made of

613
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,440
shaky data. Only the head was put of

614
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,200
Shiva. Okay. It gives a certain

615
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,000
direction because remember in shakti

616
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,279
basana everything is shy. It's very easy

617
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,240
to ex experience shy. What is difficult

618
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,480
is discrimination, self-control and to

619
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,480
follow only the vidya shaky and not get

620
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,080
diverted by aidya shaky because

621
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,679
everything is shaky. Even the assuras

622
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
are shaky. But you are not to follow

623
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,960
that path. You have to follow the path

624
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,039
that will take that will take the human

625
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,080
soul to higher states.

626
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,799
That is why the head of GPati is changed

627
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,480
into the head by Shiva. So gives

628
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,559
direction.

629
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
But Gpati is very intuitive. He's

630
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,240
extremely intelligent. He has the

631
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,360
knowledge of all the 64 arts. So all

632
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,200
these things 64 arts, these etc things

633
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,120
are manifestation of shi. He has

634
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
mastered he knows all that and he's also

635
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,559
the Brahman of course because he's a god

636
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
at the end of the day. So we worship

637
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,400
Gpati as the beginning of all things

638
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,240
because with his superior intelligence

639
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,000
he will get the thing done. Even what

640
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,440
you cannot imagine there's a problem

641
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,559
you're stuck somewhere. He knows how to

642
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,080
get you out of it. Gpati is of course

643
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,400
there's much more to Gpati than that.

644
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,039
I'm saying in a very brief line. So he

645
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,960
gpati represents the path of shi and

646
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,000
historically though interestingly we'll

647
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,120
see that um uh while gapati was popular

648
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,400
uh even in the vic times but the major

649
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,360
focus of gpatiasa started about uh 1200

650
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,080
or 1300 years from earlier it's like the

651
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,559
focus means there's a whole the whole um

652
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,880
the sect of gapati ganapatayas who

653
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,960
worship exclusively gpati that came in

654
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,559
very prominently a little later

655
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,440
according to scholars it wasn't as

656
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:45,200
popular in the vic times little later.

657
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,520
Uh so so basically as the world

658
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,679
progresses there is a reason for this.

659
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,919
The vic scriptures are very oriented

660
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,159
towards the purusha.

661
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,080
So when you study the Vedas the most

662
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,360
important thing is absolute discipline.

663
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,919
So there are people you'll see

664
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,960
practicing the vic chanting to get the

665
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,799
correct sara for 20 30 years

666
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,760
continuously practicing continuous you

667
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,400
perfection discipline consistency

668
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,799
perfection. These are qualities of the

669
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
purusha data. Perfection, perfection,

670
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,440
perfection. Practice, practice,

671
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,520
practice, practice, practice. Masculine

672
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,000
energy within spiritual guru. Yes, that

673
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,240
is the path of the purusha. Whereas a

674
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,480
little later towards say the post

675
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,559
upanishadik era the puranas came in the

676
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,559
tantras became prominent. There the

677
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,880
energy is more feminine. Feminine energy

678
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,279
is organic and intuitive. More

679
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,960
intuitive. Okay. So Gpati that story

680
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,320
comes to us now when Shiva and Parvati

681
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,799
says that who can cross cover up the you

682
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,240
know and go around the world. So what

683
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,000
Gpati does is that he goes down Shiva

684
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,679
and Shaki says it's done the whole world

685
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
is here. Okay. So that's a very

686
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,919
intuitive and intelligent way of getting

687
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,240
the problem solved. Whereas Kartika goes

688
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,400
in his vahana across the world because

689
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,760
he follows the straight path and he

690
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,440
follows the path of determination.

691
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,640
There's strong determination that

692
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,400
whatever when his blessings come. See uh

693
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,400
it's not a comparison of the two. So

694
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,080
they are doing a leela leela means they

695
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,440
demonstrating to the world that these

696
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,360
are different paths through which you

697
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,400
can go depending on the individual. So

698
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,000
GPA's path is very intelligent organic.

699
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,919
That's that that intelligence

700
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
automatically comes and that is why one

701
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,400
of the reasons why it is recommended for

702
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,080
people who practice jotic astrology to

703
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,279
get some blessings of Gandati because he

704
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,760
will help you to see the combinations

705
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:29,600
very quickly of the grahas. What does

706
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,360
this mean? So expands your uh

707
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,440
quick intelligent power and also puts it

708
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,159
in the service of spirituality. That is

709
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,760
his beautiful blessing. Whereas kanda is

710
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,679
that warrior sense that uh you'll also

711
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,159
see in south India for example

712
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,240
especially in Tamil Nadu and also in the

713
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,559
some of the Hindus who live outside of

714
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,279
Tamil Nadu in other uh south Asian

715
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,520
countries. So when scand festivals

716
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,919
happen they you'll see them piercing

717
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,840
their bodies with veils here or hanging

718
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,919
themselves walking on fire and doing

719
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,279
various kinds of very fierce practices.

720
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,399
So those are aligned to the burusha.

721
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,360
Okay. They're very much aligned to the

722
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,600
bush masculine practice. Yes. So you you

723
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,279
do you torture yourself a bit. Okay.

724
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,200
That brings about a terrific

725
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,600
concentration. You concentrate on one

726
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,600
thing like the veil. So once he releases

727
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,120
the veil towards the target, nothing can

728
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,240
stop it. Even if it's a mountain or

729
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,279
break through the mountain and go and

730
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,279
hit the target. Same way his his veil

731
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,480
represents determination, concentration

732
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,880
and victory. Once that veil or blessing

733
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,080
of the veil comes to an upasa or to a

734
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,240
scandu basa that furious energy to

735
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,960
succeed comes in nothing can stop that

736
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,919
person some surface level questions now

737
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,360
yes um I think this is a concept we've

738
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,520
discussed on multiple episodes with

739
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,840
yourself as well as other

740
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,480
speakers on sanatan

741
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,600
um often when you pray to a particular

742
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,360
dity or when you're involved in a

743
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,960
particular opasa you do pick up

744
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,200
characteristics of that dity correct

745
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,200
Absolutely. I see this with so many of

746
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,960
the Krishna opas who come on the show.

747
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,200
They are blissed out more than normal.

748
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,159
Uh there's certain sense of contentment.

749
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,320
With the Shiva, it's usually for lack of

750
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,840
better word some kind of detachment or

751
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,200
there's a little withdrawn. Um with

752
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,279
shaktias, it's a lot of intensity.

753
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,039
So what would be the adjective

754
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,360
associated with scandupasa?

755
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,000
I find scandupasana to bring about a

756
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,360
tremendous

757
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,799
intensity in an upasa. Shakti upasana is

758
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,640
not just intensity. It could depends on

759
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,799
the shi. If it's tripur sunundi it's

760
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,120
very different. It's very there's a that

761
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,679
bliss that you talk about in vaynava

762
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,520
krishna opasakas that equal amount of

763
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,080
bliss comes in even with triurundi

764
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,880
terrific amount of bliss. Scand's beauty

765
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,520
is that that determination comes in the

766
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,840
uppasaka that determination and that uh

767
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,320
to for lack of better words people

768
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,000
around may find even that person to be a

769
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,760
little arrogant but it's not arrogance

770
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,919
it's the power of Mars that works that

771
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,360
way because once you set in your mind

772
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,200
you will get it done and there's no

773
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,760
amount of opposition that can stop you

774
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,240
nothing it's like that fixed energy he

775
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,399
grips the soul and the body and he gives

776
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,320
floods the upasa with so much energy so

777
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,840
energy that you feel that you can

778
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,399
there's nothing that can stop you

779
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,520
success is guaranteed in fact very

780
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,520
interestingly uh I mentioned it once

781
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,520
earlier somewhere

782
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,120
there are old texts in Nepal and other

783
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,279
areas and somebody had sent a copy of

784
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,039
that text to me uh where till again 7th

785
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,200
8th century when scandupasana was

786
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:44,240
popular across India scanda was

787
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,880
considered as the vic equivalent of vata

788
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,440
vata is a small child

789
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,520
form of varandha was also considered as

790
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,240
the son of Shiva and Parvati as a small

791
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,919
child and scandupasana by the way is

792
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,159
very old. It comes from the Vedas the

793
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,880
Atarva itself there is a whole uh

794
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,720
section of you know mentions about

795
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,000
scandupasa the other thing about

796
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,000
scandupasana even see in the uh in Bihar

797
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,399
and other regions there's a chhattpuja

798
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,200
that is so popular right to shashi devi

799
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,720
is woripped the sixth day chhat ppuja uh

800
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,720
sixth day shashi dev is also worshiped

801
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,039
in Bengal site when a child is born the

802
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,799
sixth day there's a puja done so

803
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,960
protection of children was also a domain

804
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,080
that scand used to take care of

805
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,960
protecting from serpas nagas. So there

806
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,720
is a iconography of scandha where

807
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,880
scandha is there the vahana which is the

808
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,120
peacock is there and that peacock is

809
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,039
actually biting into a snake because

810
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,760
peacocks are enemies of snakes bites

811
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,840
into a snake and with a with the talons

812
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,000
of the peacock with the it's only

813
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,000
gripping another snake like that. So

814
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,320
this is a very popular iconography and

815
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,159
in a temple like uh in south it's a

816
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,080
temple called kukes subrain in Bangalore

817
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,080
where people go to do various pujas for

818
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,960
serposha serpent related problems and

819
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,760
all that socandha becomes the lord who

820
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,360
can control surplus it's very powerful

821
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,360
thing very very powerful thing and it

822
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,399
has got tremendous implications in

823
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,799
spirituality that he has the ability to

824
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,960
control serpus serpas are of serpas are

825
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,200
basically you can look at it as you know

826
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,320
these um

827
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,679
lower emotions, envy, jealousy, anger,

828
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,679
these are all representative by his

829
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:27,360
karpas, serpas. Okay. So that things he

830
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:31,679
can he can his vahana and his upasana

831
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,240
can grip that uh negative feeling or

832
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,919
energy and protect upasa from that. You

833
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,360
gain discipline over your own mind.

834
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,360
Absolutely. And discipline over your

835
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,360
life.

836
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:48,320
Okay.

837
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:51,519
Do you see reflections of scandopasa

838
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,760
in Tamil friends that you have? Because

839
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,840
I I see it a little bit. I have a friend

840
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
called Madan Gowi. Okay. He's the one of

841
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,799
the biggest Tamil YouTubers in our

842
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,320
country. Whenever I speak to him,

843
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,279
everything that you again very masculine

844
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,799
guy, disciplined, consistency,

845
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,080
stillness, very relaxed, never heard him

846
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,240
say a negative word about another

847
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,519
YouTuber, self assured. Um and he's one

848
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,760
of my Tamil friends. I have many other

849
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,919
Tamil friends who are scandas.

850
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,760
Same as Muruga. Yeah, same Murugan

851
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,799
Muruga. Same date. Anything you'd like

852
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,640
to say about Tamil identity because it's

853
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,559
also the most successful state in our

854
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,080
country's independent history. I love

855
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,840
Tamil. I've been there. I've stayed

856
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,320
there for some time. I go there often

857
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,320
and I visit uh for specifically for the

858
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,240
Scanda temples. I visit Parani which is

859
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,240
a one of the six main temples of

860
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,840
Scandanda. Many are there. That's one of

861
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
the primary and powerful temples and

862
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,720
there are other temples also of

863
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,200
Scandanda. So in order to uh take a dash

864
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,360
of Bhagavan Scandanda I do visit uh

865
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,440
Tamil Nadu very often and in fact last

866
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,760
year we had gone me and two of my people

867
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,200
had gone on a road trip uh across Tamil

868
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,360
Nadu looking for a land for temple. U so

869
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,200
yeah I I like Tamil Nadu very much. In

870
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,039
fact, it is here in Tamil Nadu only

871
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,679
which where I had bought my first

872
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,240
Vikrahov scand in Chennai and I had kept

873
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,240
it in my home for no specific reason. If

874
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,839
somebody used to tell me why why have

875
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,800
you kept it give it to somebody and my

876
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,560
answer would be that I'm going to

877
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,159
worship him but I don't know when and

878
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,000
then things certain things happened and

879
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,839
I was forced into the worship of scand

880
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,879
and then I started enjoying it and it's

881
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,520
absolutely terrific and I've had people

882
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,599
come to me help me out in times of

883
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,359
crisis and difficulty who have some of

884
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,520
the other links to scanda and I've seen

885
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,760
that many times happening many times

886
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,839
people born on scandi or worshiping

887
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,520
scand out of the blue coming and you

888
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,119
know helping me out in a difficult

889
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,159
situation situation a crisis situation.

890
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,200
So Scanda is a terrific dity and I

891
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,200
believe that we will come to a time when

892
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,440
the worship of Scanda will again become

893
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,919
pan India.

894
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,079
Okay, great you brought this up. I have

895
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,440
to bring in some alternative angles

896
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,960
here. Yeah, my entire

897
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,880
time period of last year was about

898
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,119
interreligious studies, going abroad,

899
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,200
understanding different cultures etc.

900
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,079
did a lot of episodes on British occult

901
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,119
with the occultists there. Uh what they

902
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,200
told me is that when Europeans kind of

903
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,839
set out to conquer the world, it was

904
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,240
actually very good for Europe's

905
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,320
financial trajectory. Okay, perhaps that

906
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,280
was one of the intentions behind going

907
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,760
out and conquering different countries.

908
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,079
There's a life experience I recommend to

909
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,760
anyone who has a spiritual bent of mine,

910
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,079
which is go to the um British Museum in

911
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,119
London. Okay, it's important to go there

912
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,640
because what they've done is they've

913
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,800
collected statues vigor of deities from

914
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,400
every possible ancient culture right

915
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,640
from Byzantine to uh ours they have a

916
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,440
whole India section to Chinese culture

917
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,680
to New Zealand culture to African

918
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,240
countries like it's extremely

919
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,640
stimulating an experience. One of the

920
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,400
things you notice there is that many of

921
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,280
the statues almost all of them have

922
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,079
broken noses

923
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,920
including the sphinx in Egypt which is

924
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,560
still you can't take the whole sphinx

925
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,160
away but you can break its nose. So one

926
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,800
of the British occultists that I spoke

927
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,680
to said that this is an ancient

928
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,400
technique to remove what we call chetana

929
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,480
from a statue. Basically the pran of the

930
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,760
statue goes away. It's like you're kind

931
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,240
of killing off the statue's energy. And

932
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,160
this basically the statues that were

933
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,040
collected, all of them almost had broken

934
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,320
noses. So there's clearly something

935
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,240
might be there. Yeah, I went a little

936
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,839
deeper into this study. And uh what many

937
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,079
modern

938
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,119
researchers on these subjects believe is

939
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:53,440
that uh imperialists from that period

940
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,960
which is 500 600 years ago knew

941
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,079
how

942
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,520
polytheistic societies work and knew

943
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,440
these little elements like hey break the

944
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,560
nose to remove the pran shaky of the

945
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:09,680
statue. Uh take away the

946
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,240
war gods from cultures

947
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,400
um create divide and rule mentality

948
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,960
within a culture. We had a nihangik

949
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,160
leader recently on the show who was a

950
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,160
specialist in chhatraya which is another

951
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,320
kind of martial art that came out of

952
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,760
India other than kaleri paiu and they

953
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,599
believe that it's the extension of the

954
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,520
same martial art which was used in the

955
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,280
mahabharat. So they look at themselves

956
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,960
as descendants of the sanatanis from

957
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,359
back then. These are six nihang six

958
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,240
who call themselves sanatanis.

959
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,720
They said that we were categorically um

960
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,240
stripped away from a vidya as in siki

961
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,720
sikism was stripped away from

962
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,440
chhatravidya because nihangik were

963
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,839
becoming a big problem for British. Yeah

964
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,240
in the 1800s and I think roughly in

965
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,000
about 1870 something I can't remember

966
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,320
the exact date.

967
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,200
um the British applied divide and rule

968
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,119
on the six to create one pro-sanati

969
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,440
school which was headed by the Nihang

970
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,280
six and the other one was anti-sanati

971
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,520
which tried creating a drift between

972
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,520
Hindus and six um all this is coming to

973
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,200
the forefront now now in this whole

974
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,359
essay that I said my conjecture is that

975
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,599
I believe that scandupasa has been

976
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,240
removed from our country very

977
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,480
systematically to remove that little bit

978
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,119
of war element to take out the edge from

979
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,920
our land. That's my reading. And I might

980
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,839
be wrong, but this is why in my heart,

981
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,400
especially after going closer to Skull,

982
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,720
I thank Tamil Nadu a lot. You've kept it

983
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,800
alive and now it has its chance at

984
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,960
regrowing throughout the country.

985
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,480
Uh this whole essay is nothing to do

986
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,400
with being anti-European,

987
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,200
anti-imperialist,

988
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,040
but it has everything to do with taking

989
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,480
Bat back to its original culture of

990
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,160
having a god of war which is very much

991
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,720
needed in the current geopolitical

992
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,320
scenario of our times. Do you agree with

993
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,720
me, disagree with me about anything I

994
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,280
said? Broadly agree with you. though I

995
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,960
don't know uh because I have not uh I

996
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
can't say I don't know because I can't

997
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,560
say whether they were systematically

998
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:15,200
removed or whether it was the uh you

999
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,359
know the the way of time of Mahakala

1000
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,839
that it got removed for various reasons

1001
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,359
I don't know I can't say uh but yes of

1002
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,800
course there are when whenever there's a

1003
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,560
monotheistic culture that comes in

1004
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,480
contact with a polytheistic culture it

1005
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,000
causes a lot of damage to the vigraas

1006
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,000
and mortis we have seen that right from

1007
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,240
ancient times attacks on sumnat to other

1008
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,160
places and all that But leaving that

1009
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,760
aside, scandupasana is going to

1010
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,640
increase. There is no doubt about it. We

1011
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,480
need that energy. We need so bava first

1012
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,960
creates the base. Okay. Bava is the

1013
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,800
first dity. So that is precisely why uh

1014
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,520
the bhavadna the way it is picking up.

1015
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,160
For example, the next stage of the bhav

1016
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,320
sadhana comes di sadna and scandupasana.

1017
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,000
These are all parallel movements in

1018
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,000
sadena. What can you explain this? So

1019
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,640
first is there is a whole lot of people

1020
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,240
who are doing bavasana right and this is

1021
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,200
going to increase with time. It's not

1022
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,000
going to decrease. It's bavuasana also

1023
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,000
relegated itself to a sort of a you know

1024
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,320
a secondary position for the last

1025
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,640
thousand years at least. Uh before that

1026
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,599
he was a very prominent tantric deity

1027
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,440
across India. Uh and I would say that

1028
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,520
many of the practices related to Shiva

1029
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,200
that were there in specifically in parts

1030
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,440
of North India and Bengal were actually

1031
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,240
basically of Bhava and Mahakala rather

1032
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,160
than of Shiva specifically. Okay. So

1033
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,000
sometimes the difference is very thin.

1034
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,200
Even Bhava can be called as Shiva. But

1035
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,040
when you see the intensity of the

1036
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,720
practice when the data is being taken

1037
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,800
out in procession and the people the way

1038
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,280
they are behaving that that raw energy

1039
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,079
is there in Vava. Shiva is more milder

1040
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,839
when when he is Shiva same being is very

1041
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,000
mild. When is Vavva that aggressive

1042
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,320
energy is there. So we are seeing an

1043
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,400
upsurge of vavasana across India and it

1044
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,800
is going to increase automatically it

1045
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,480
will lead to dyasa. Automatically that

1046
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,040
will also lead to scandupasa.

1047
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,359
Scandupasana is set to come back again

1048
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,119
very strongly across India I feel and

1049
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,680
which is why the eight temples that I uh

1050
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,240
you know sort of plan to uh if Barava

1051
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,800
will sit of course Baba's with his with

1052
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,240
his consent and with his blessings it

1053
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,640
will have each of these will have a

1054
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,640
scandigraha

1055
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,119
apart from bhava there will be a dvi

1056
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,880
vigraha multiple bavas will be there

1057
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,640
there will be a dvi vigraha and there

1058
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,839
will also be a scandra

1059
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,119
inside it is absolutely important.

1060
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,800
There's a specific configuration in

1061
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,880
which this will come and that becomes a

1062
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,880
very very powerp packed center of

1063
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,800
energy. Okay. So, Scandanda

1064
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,800
is that

1065
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,720
clean warrior

1066
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,280
who immediately goes into battle

1067
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,280
straight. He's like that arrow quick.

1068
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,520
So, he's not going to wait for the enemy

1069
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,960
to come front and all that. Moment

1070
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,200
there's a threat, there's a battle, he

1071
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,640
will go straight into the war. That is

1072
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,319
that is the nature of the weapons he

1073
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,760
carries also. And in fact people would

1074
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,280
be very amazed to know that some of the

1075
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,680
old texts of uh Hinduism actually

1076
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,599
mentions that Mahisasura was some old

1077
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,839
texts in some versions of the story

1078
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,560
Misasura was killed by Scandanda. We

1079
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,400
know that Madura kills Mahisasura right

1080
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,240
but in some old text it's mentioned

1081
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Scandinasura.

1082
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,319
So basically here is a deity who is

1083
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,640
chief purpose of birth was to defeat

1084
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,480
Assura's and enemies. is the absolute

1085
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,680
god of war and it takes the person into

1086
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,599
a frenzy frenzy scand even bava to some

1087
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,839
degree but scand more than that if you

1088
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,760
keep as one keeps doing scandupasana

1089
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,440
mantra sadana deeper goes deeper into

1090
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,359
sadhana

1091
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,040
it's like a possession of the soul that

1092
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,200
happens you'll feel that tremendous

1093
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,880
energy and you will have it's like the

1094
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,520
blinkers of a horse you will not think

1095
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,359
of anything just one singleointed aim

1096
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,280
whatever is that aim and it will get

1097
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,200
done and in higher upasana

1098
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,680
uh scandupasana happens in my opinion

1099
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,000
very well if one goes a little away from

1100
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,319
society sometimes very intense sadhana

1101
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,160
not saying everybody should do it most

1102
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,079
of the scandopasana that happens today

1103
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,319
large part of it is more of bi oriented

1104
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,960
scandopasa which is also good but the

1105
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,040
hardcore bantraasa scand it's good to do

1106
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,680
if someone is a little away from society

1107
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,720
in a forested area it's in seclusion

1108
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,119
okay and the six is so crucial there are

1109
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,520
certain priyoggas and sadhanavadascanda

1110
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,839
six days one has to do it completely cut

1111
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,920
off from people and it takes hours to

1112
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,520
sit and do if it's correctly done by the

1113
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,480
sixth day you'll see results and

1114
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,400
unfailing results he is that I I

1115
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,800
remember once I was doing a scandup and

1116
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,839
out of the blue this peacock started

1117
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,040
coming there in that area so he

1118
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,960
literally is the god who goes he's the

1119
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,880
general so he will lead from the front

1120
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,920
he doesn't wait till the battle has come

1121
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,599
to him he just leads from the front and

1122
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,000
um the other thing about scandupasana

1123
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,440
that happens is that it increases uh it

1124
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,079
makes a very sharp mind in the sense

1125
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,280
that

1126
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,160
strong ability for arguments it gives to

1127
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,760
noasa person if you put a scandop basa

1128
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,359
genuine one see a lot of people have

1129
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,960
bias on scand I'm talking somebody who

1130
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,880
has attained the blessing of scanda

1131
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,560
properly his mind will become so sharp

1132
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,040
put him into an argument that same

1133
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,760
ferocity same ability to attack same

1134
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,160
ability to uh you know fight comes even

1135
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,680
in that mind also so any argument that

1136
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,000
is putt. Tand is a master of logic. is a

1137
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,319
master of logic and he can give such

1138
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,079
terrific logical mind to an individual

1139
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,000
that whatever you put he will be able to

1140
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,640
do kandana which is he will be able to

1141
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
deconstruct that argument very easily

1142
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,920
with the least effort if he has

1143
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,240
blessings of scandal that's another

1144
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,280
thing scand is very good for children by

1145
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,160
the way protection of children in tamil

1146
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,839
he's the the god for everything but I'm

1147
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,599
saying that not just tamil people I mean

1148
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,920
for other people also and you're right

1149
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,400
that I'm I'm we all should be grateful

1150
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,640
to people from tamiladu that scandup in

1151
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,400
whatever format. Maybe the ancient ways

1152
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,720
in which kandopasana used to happen with

1153
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,040
hardcore practices that has reduced more

1154
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,119
into a bacti based upasana today which

1155
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,359
is also okay at least there is the the

1156
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,839
the trend of the upasana is still there

1157
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,520
which is very wonderful but a time will

1158
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,760
come I feel when scand will become

1159
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,760
panindia god and not just panindia god

1160
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,560
he will

1161
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,640
a primary dity because we are also

1162
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,880
entering in very tough times from uh

1163
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,560
from this year to the next few years is

1164
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,079
going to be wars and lot of things will

1165
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,520
happen. You will need the blessings of

1166
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,280
very aggressive daties. You will need

1167
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,800
the blessings of VA. You'll need the

1168
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,880
blessings of Scandanda. You'll need the

1169
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,200
blessings of some very fierce feminine

1170
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,000
daties. They are again going to awaken

1171
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,280
and reactivate and reactivate and they

1172
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
give you the power to pass through

1173
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,079
difficult times.

1174
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,200
Felt it.

1175
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,520
Yes. But difficult times means that you

1176
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,200
also have the that's what I say then

1177
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,720
when a when a god gives you a difficult

1178
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,000
time it means that he thinks that you

1179
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:57,599
have potential. Um

1180
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,440
your video on behaviors is one of the

1181
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,240
most iconic videos that's ever come out

1182
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,079
of Indian YouTube when it comes to

1183
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:09,200
rebooting tantra in our culture.

1184
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,599
Are we even allowed to give out a very

1185
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:16,200
basic scandasa?

1186
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,200
Yes. So I

1187
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,839
I asked the people who follow me I asked

1188
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,599
them to do on shashi titis uh on the on

1189
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,160

1190
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,839
moon shuklabaka shashi sixth dity of

00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,640
scandha so so after full moon after full

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,160
so when there's the bright phase of the

1194
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,599
moon there's the dark phase of the moon

1195
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,119
krishna waning and wax yes so you can

1196
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,720
these list you can find on the online

1197
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,880
Google or any of the panchchang will

1198
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:48,079
tell you that so sixth of that is

1199
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,920
specifically dedicated to scand okay. So

1200
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,440
on that day I tell people those who

1201
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,160
follow my spiritual advices to light at

1202
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,640
least one dya have a picture of scanda

1203
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,920
or light oney and then sit and do this

1204
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,680
kand ashtarama ashtra means 108 names of

1205
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,280
scand it's very easily available these

1206
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,440
days on the internet again thanks to

1207
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,200
Google see these are easier in a way

1208
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,720
technology has made some things easier

1209
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,400
100 years ago these things were not

1210
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,880
available to people it is only available

1211
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,440
to the specific gurus or the temples or

1212
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,760
the sradas and in order to know These

1213
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,359
108 names also you have to go to them

1214
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,119
take initiation and things like that.

1215
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,880
But nature has created a system whether

1216
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,960
we like it or not is irrelevant and it's

1217
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,720
not going to go back. All the texts are

1218
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,359
in the open today. Everybody can read

1219
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,960
and this is it's not going to go back.

1220
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,800
It's going to be from here. This is the

1221
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,240
reality. Nature has caused this reality

1222
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,920
to happen. So there must be some reason

1223
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,240
for it. So let's make the best use of

1224
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,160
it. That's my way of looking at it. Of

1225
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,359
course not everything can be done from

1226
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,200
text but there are a lot of things that

1227
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,200
can be done. There's no problem in it.

1228
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,359
So the ashtoama the 108 names of scand

1229
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,800
read that read that six times read that

1230
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:57,359
10 times just light wanda put some nayam

1231
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,839
or some food or bh we call it or some

1232
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:02,000
offering of food little bit something

1233
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,760
sweet is very good to give offer to him

1234
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,680
some fruits some sweet something like

1235
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,599
that in front oney and that chant that

1236
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,480
if if somebody is serious about it then

1237
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:15,200
start chanting it at least 12 times okay

1238
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,880
the 108 names you keep doing that for

1239
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,079
some period few months you will start

1240
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,079
experiencing the impact of scandopasana

1241
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,079
and this is like the beginning stages

1242
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,599
higher stages so there are things like

1243
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,280
uh you know there are priogas of

1244
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,880
scandanda which is the satu samahara

1245
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,359
prioga they call it destruction of

1246
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,880
enemies six day pyoga that happens there

1247
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:36,319
are specific pujas that can happen but

1248
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,480
all that is more later stage what about

1249
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,680
people who have a rudra mala at home and

1250
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,839
are doing bhav upasana

1251
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,440
in the same way that omhavayama is a

1252
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,400
mantra that we can give out to people.

1253
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,720
Is there anything? There is a mantra but

1254
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,720
uh I will not give it out until I've

1255
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,960
actually I mean of course in the

1256
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,119
internet you can find lot of mantras but

1257
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,079
uh until I have contemplated a bit more

1258
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,559
on that uh but at this moment see if you

1259
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,559
want to connect to scanda then the astra

1260
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,559
nama is very good. Ashtra is nothing but

1261
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,960
the names of scand which is also there

1262
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,960
you'll find scandai

1263
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,640
like this. Okay,

1264
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,400
various names are there. Okay. What if

1265
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,319
you just pick up one and start doing?

1266
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,599
You can you can but you have to be a

1267
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,000
little careful that you choose the right

1268
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,839
name. Some guidance may be required in

1269
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,040
that. That is why whereas if you do the

1270
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:29,200
whole 108 names that creates a more uh

1271
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,760
comprehensive energy.

1272
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,119
Okay. Okay. One more extended question.

1273
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,280
Okay. because we've done so many

1274
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:40,319
episodes on Dvi upasa and behava.

1275
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,839
The way I explain in upasna and tantra

1276
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:44,800
to any of my friends who are not aware

1277
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,640
of these subjects is that I tell them

1278
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,680
that think that you're doing chemistry

1279
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,240
with reality. You're doing some kind of

1280
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,839
chemical reactions with reality through

1281
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,920
mantras. That's how powerful mantras

1282
00:49:53,839 --> 00:50:01,040
are. But you need to be guided in terms

1283
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,720
of which mantras mix with which other

1284
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,359
mantras and which ones you shouldn't do

1285
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,160
and uh the different proportions of each

1286
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:11,040
one. I believe that it's not wise to

1287
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,240
jump from one dity to another completely

1288
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,319
etc. Is that a correct pattern of

1289
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,160
thinking or maybe I want to reframe my

1290
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,520
question in terms of how do you know

1291
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:25,280
whether you should do bhraasa?

1292
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,640
So that is to find out which dity

1293
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,400
upasana you have to do there are two

1294
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,640
three methods one is that first the

1295
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,640
basic is that if you have a uh if you

1296
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,720
have a liking for a specific deity you

1297
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,960
can start off that way or if there's a

1298
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,800
specific deity who's woripped uh in your

1299
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,480
family you can start of that dity or if

1300
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,800
you have a guru who specifically tells

1301
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,079
you you worship this dity or the last is

1302
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,079
if you look at the horoscope of an

1303
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,240
individual you can get some idea about

1304
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,079
what dity is suitable for the individual

1305
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,680
and the last is if there is a problem

1306
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,000
going on in life and you want a solution

1307
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,839
to that problem then it can be some dity

1308
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,960
that may or may not be a primary dity.

1309
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,640
It could be something you have to do

1310
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,920
temporarily for 6 months or a year or

1311
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,119
something like that. That's also

1312
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,040
possible. So all in all uh first thing

1313
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,400
is that can multiple daties be woripped?

1314
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,640
Yes, it can be woripped. There's no

1315
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,240
problem in that. Uh you may have ba as

1316
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,079
your primary dity along with it you can

1317
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,200
worship some form of Dvi, you can

1318
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,839
worship worship scand gpati. It depends

1319
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,839
on what is it that you want. Finally why

1320
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:22,720
are you woriing these daties. So there

1321
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,800
is yeah how about creating a sad which

1322
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,800
is effectively the whole shivshaki

1323
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,680
family. Yes. So that's precisely what I

1324
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,800
ask people to do in the uh through the

1325
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:38,240
telegram groups that my team runs. So we

1326
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,520
there's a vavas we do on okay there is a

1327
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,839
daasana we do onashtami

1328
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,559
that is the bright fortnite oft we do on

1329
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:49,040
the dark fortnite. Okay. On shashi

1330
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,040
there's a scanduana. On chhaturup dashi

1331
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,200
we do a matarasana. These are the four

1332
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,000
daties I ask people to carry on doing

1333
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,599
every month. four days a month specific

1334
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,640
intense more intense sadena of these

1335
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,640
daties and otherwise on the on an

1336
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,559
average nity upasana which is daily

1337
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,720
upasana a little less amount of these

1338
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,680
daties are done but this creates a very

1339
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,920
comprehensive force and given and for

1340
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,520
anybody who follows what I am saying

1341
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,400
these are the daties who have had a

1342
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,160
central role in my own sadhana and the

1343
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,480
uh in the driving of the organization

1344
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,160
that I'm leading right now so therefore

1345
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,160
anybody who wants to connect to me has

1346
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,000
also to connect to these datas So there

1347
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,160
it already becomes a very comprehensive

1348
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,960
force. There's kandanda, there is bhava

1349
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:33,040
even bava there is a ka in which stages.

1350
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,559
So you start with bhavva then after a

1351
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,559
point um you go to vahava you go to kala

1352
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,680
like this various things scanda is there

1353
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,760
matara is there madura is there so this

1354
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,839
becomes a very comprehensive sort of a

1355
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,119
package but in general uh uh the idea is

1356
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,480
that there is no harm in worshiing

1357
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,240
multiple daties. By the way in

1358
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,200
polytheistic cultures everybody worships

1359
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,440
multiple daties but you have one central

1360
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,079
dity you like more. Say you like bhava

1361
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,559
more. So what you do is that your

1362
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,880
sadhana may suppose bhav is a central

1363
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,319
dity it starts with bhava first. Okay.

1364
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,000
And you do a substantial amount of the

1365
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,079
bav

1366
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,839
mantra japa or whatever then you go do a

1367
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,520
little bit of dyu basana suppose then

1368
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,839
suppose you're doing gpati depends on

1369
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,640
the person to person and some amount of

1370
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,920
scand and once the whole thing is

1371
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,800
completed for the day when you're doing

1372
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,960
nityasana the last tupasana also last

1373
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,079
end of the day you again do a little bit

1374
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,079
of pranam suppose he's the main dity end

1375
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,559
the day with the pranam and say that

1376
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,520
actually all the daties are your own

1377
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:38,160
consciousness M one has become many many

1378
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,160
has become one. Would you like to end

1379
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,040
the episode by talking about the

1380
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,079
upcoming 5 years? It's going to be tough

1381
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:49,599
for everybody and uh lot of things that

1382
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,960
we imagined or taken for granted

1383
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:56,160
will change. We might go through crisis

1384
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,640
situations in India specifically. There

1385
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,960
could be wars but look at it as a stage

1386
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,920
of deep cleaning that will be done by

1387
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,160
the daties and people we may also lose

1388
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,839
lot of people by the way that is another

1389
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,520
possibility I see that people you have

1390
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,200
things you have taken for granted or

1391
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,480
people you have taken for granted

1392
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,839
suddenly some things happen that is also

1393
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,839
one chance is there there's a

1394
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:20,079
possibility of there but fundamentally

1395
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:23,760
this is a time when spiritually you can

1396
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,839
grow much faster see it's the whole

1397
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,520
uh common knowledge

1398
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,000
in history is that only in times of

1399
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,680
crisis you make the fastest progress

1400
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,839
spiritually. When things are very good,

1401
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,839
you will not make progress. Even the the

1402
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,000
whole point why the gods the great gods

1403
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,839
the mortis and the shivas shaki and

1404
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,280
others they have created the assuras.

1405
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,559
What was the need of assuras in the

1406
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,319
first place? Just the gods would have

1407
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,559
been enough. But if the gods were only

1408
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,000
there, they would never change. They

1409
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,400
would be static where they are. You

1410
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,240
would be static where you are. Without

1411
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,839
change means friction. First there has

1412
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,000
to be friction. Friction will cause

1413
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,599
change. Movement. Otherwise everything

1414
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,280
remains static means you are permanently

1415
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,559
fixed in wherever you are. You have no

1416
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,240
chance of growing beyond the human

1417
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,760
condition. It's because there is

1418
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,640
conflict. There is going to be stress.

1419
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,800
So you have the chance to apply yourself

1420
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,720
more strongly and through that redeem

1421
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,599
yourself and grow higher faster. It's

1422
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,720
been a tough five years already. It's it

1423
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:19,440
may become tougher financially

1424
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,440
uh in terms of uh there could be some

1425
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,800
kind of crisis that may happen. there

1426
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,440
could be natural calamities and

1427
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,559
definitely there will be wars

1428
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,480
and uh even in our neighborhoods. So

1429
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,319
basically at the end of the day what I

1430
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,119
am very sanguin about is that people

1431
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:38,480
plus India itself will undergo a change

1432
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:40,559
in the graas in this year itself and

1433
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,640
that will make things more tougher in

1434
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:48,000
some senses. So for people

1435
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,079
do more sadena of fierce forms like bava

1436
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,400
do more sadhana of di do more sadha of

1437
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,079
scandanda but behav definitely he's his

1438
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,400
time is here right now he's the most

1439
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,119
active of all the forms

1440
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,599
would you say for vashnavites that they

1441
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:05,200
should dive into nursing

1442
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:09,839
yeah I mean that's up to them what their

1443
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,520
is but uh upasan is very good he's in

1444
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,640
fact considered as

1445
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,400
is is almost like a rdra in some of the

1446
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,680
interestingly one of the ashtra namas of

1447
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,799
Narasima 108 names of Lord Narasima

1448
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,520
describes him as bhava-ike sometimes

1449
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:28,240
okay that ferocity is there that extreme

1450
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,640
amount of power and aggression and there

1451
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,000
is a corresponding form of bhava that's

1452
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,799
also linked to narma which is the

1453
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,200
survwara which is the the story goes

1454
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,640
that when he could not calm down then

1455
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:43,440
Shiva first sent vidadra to calm

1456
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,839
Narasima down but nar calm down then

1457
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,160
there was the uh there's a form of Shiva

1458
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:51,359
very peculiar form with eight legs okay

1459
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:55,119
and wings and the body of a a bird and a

1460
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:57,200
animal uh who's known as survveshwara is

1461
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,520
one of the akash bava is very fierce

1462
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,280
from a bhava extremely fierce his

1463
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,680
mantras are for destruction of enemies

1464
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,400
and removing black magic very good and

1465
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,559
very potent in that sense along with him

1466
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,520
comes the force of pratanga and shuli

1467
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,280
nidorga two very fierce forms of dvi. So

1468
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,880
basically again in south India his

1469
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,760
zupasana is there are temples where

1470
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,160
zupasana happens and his mantra sadnas

1471
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,040
are there for removal of negatives and

1472
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,720
things like that. So basically yeah

1473
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,040
for a vishnava if he wants to do more

1474
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,359
aggressive form of sadena I guess nar

1475
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,880
sadha will be good but I don't want so

1476
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,720
it's not about just doing an aggressive

1477
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,640
form there are certain deities who are

1478
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,559
going to

1479
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,720
awaken very strongly as we have seen

1480
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,319
like vava it's already there it's going

1481
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,160
to happen it's already happening it's

1482
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,079
not going to change it's not about uh

1483
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,599
just randomly picking something no it

1484
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,480
doesn't work that way it is what they

1485
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,920
will it if they if it has been willed

1486
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,319
has decided that he's going to awaken

1487
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,319
reawake himself

1488
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:57,119
spring up everywhere in India and

1489
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,440
reawaken consciousness of the people

1490
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,599
then it is his will he will come so I

1491
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,040
have seen and I've had cases where I

1492
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,520
have males from Vishnavas also have

1493
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,359
started doing varad I mean they have

1494
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,280
tried experimented a few times with a

1495
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,880
few malas and then it gelled with them

1496
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,319
so automatically it went up they may not

1497
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,160
be telling people but I get males so

1498
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:19,040
that's why I know in the old world

1499
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,920
from the last thousand years

1500
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,920
or before that as

1501
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:27,920
I think conversations about omens were

1502
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,799
much more prevalent than they are now

1503
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,760
likely. Yes. You know, in just the last

1504
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:35,119
month, uh I don't know if you've read

1505
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,400
about all these deep sea creatures

1506
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,240
coming to the surface and now

1507
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,079
fish washed up on the shores of Kerala.

1508
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:47,520
Right. Right. There was a blood moon

1509
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:51,200
in I think the last few weeks.

1510
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:54,240
Um these were all the signs that would

1511
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,000
count as omens in the old world.

1512
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,839
Is there any heed one should pay to

1513
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,920
this? Uh perhaps perhaps we will pass

1514
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,920
through some difficult times. Perhaps we

1515
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,240
must find

1516
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,240
and it has already started off but it

1517
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,839
will go on for a few years at least but

1518
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,400
this is also a period of churning

1519
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:14,640
through this lot of strength inner

1520
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,680
strength will be found. It's like India

1521
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,280
will pass through a phase of crisis.

1522
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,640
Okay.

1523
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,160
Maybe the whole world but India

1524
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,079
definitely and in that phase the amount

1525
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:28,079
of faith and the amount of strength you

1526
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,760
have in your upasa is what is going to

1527
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,920
see you through. You means you me

1528
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,200
everybody all of us through. So yeah

1529
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,160
these omens can very well indicate uh

1530
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,960
that maybe we'll have a

1531
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,119
massive natural calamity.

1532
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,200
In any case, there's a shift of grahas

1533
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,760
that are happening uh for the next two

1534
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,160
months in fact two two and a half months

1535
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,480
where there will be six grahas or and

1536
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,960
Saturn and Rahu will enter into Mina

1537
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,319
Rashi and just even basic commerce

1538
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,559
somebody who has basic understanding of

1539
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,720
jotisha will agree Mina is a rashi

1540
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,720
related to water signs. So there could

1541
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,480
be some water related natural calamity

1542
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,079
possible maybe a tsunami maybe an

1543
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,000
earthquake under sea that causes a

1544
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:11,680
terrific effect outside something like

1545
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,839
that it's possible. Yeah. Um got that
