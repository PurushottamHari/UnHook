1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Have you ever sat through a meeting and

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,960
thought, "Why am I even here?" You are

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,360
not alone. Most meetings drain your

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
energy. They clutter your schedule. They

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,400
leave you wondering if there's a better

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,520
way. Well, there is. And in this video,

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,359
I'm going to share five powerful meeting

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,480
strategies that I have refined and

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,439
tested over a decade to help you run

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,000
meetings that are shorter, smarter, and

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,359
actually worth your time. I'll even show

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,640
you exactly how I leverage Otter.ai, an

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,780
AI powered meeting agent to make these

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,270
strategies effortless. Let's get

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,270
[Music]

16
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,399
started. If you're new here, hi, I'm

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,800
Thiago Forte. I've helped thousands of

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,960
people organize their digital lives and

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
maximize their productivity through my

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,520
best-selling book and online course,

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
Building a Second Brain. It doesn't

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
matter what your role is, your team,

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,239
where you work, what kind of company or

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
organization. Meetings reveal things.

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,320
They reveal the clarity of your

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
thinking, your level of preparation,

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,560
your ability to get things done. But

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,439
first, let's answer the crucial and

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,000
often overlooked question. Does this

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,159
even need to be a meeting? Modern work

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
environments present a huge challenge.

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,560
What's the best way to communicate? Is

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,119
it a quick Slack messages, a detailed

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,200
email, or do we actually need a meeting?

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,600
According to a recent Harvard Business

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,840
Review study, reducing the number of

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,920
meetings by 40% boosted productivity and

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,439
employee satisfaction by over 70%. That

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
means one of the best ways to make

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,840
meetings better is to have fewer of

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,960
them. Here's the principle I recommend.

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,680
always default to the simplest, fastest

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
method of communication unless the

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,560
situation demands more. I use the 3S

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,880
test to decide quickly. First,

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,280
sensitivity. Is the topic emotionally

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,360
charged or is it easy to misinterpret?

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,520
Second is scope. How many people are

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,079
involved? How complex is it? And third

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,879
is stakes. What's at risk? What's the

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,360
downside if this issue is misunderstood

52
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,120
or delayed? The higher the sensitivity,

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,720
the greater the scope or the number of

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
people involved, or the higher the

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,760
stakes, the more valuable, the more

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,920
important a meeting becomes. Let's dive

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,400
into the single biggest meeting mistake

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,800
most people overlook. My first tip is to

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,239
have a clear objective. They don't

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,200
actually know why they're meeting. Never

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,840
ever start a meeting without a clearly

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,800
defined objective. Before you even send

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,080
out a calendar invite, you need to know

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,239
exactly what decision needs to be made

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
after this meeting. What problem or

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,840
obstacle or challenge are you trying to

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,840
solve? What's the exact outcome that you

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
want from this meeting? You can make

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,720
each of these three points crystal clear

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,560
by including them directly in the

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,519
calendar invite. You'll immediately

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,000
notice that all the participants arrive

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
more focused, more prepared, more ready

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,519
to answer those questions that you've

75
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,319
posed. But what if you're not the one

76
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,720
hosting? Here's my advice. Never

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,920
automatically just accept a meeting

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,959
invite without asking about its purpose

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,560
first. A simple reply asking, "What is

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,480
the purpose of this meeting?" can

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,800
significantly improve the whole

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,200
experience and the outcome. Sometimes it

83
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,840
even helps the host realize you don't

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,000
even need a meeting at all. Okay, so

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,080
having a clear objective is essential,

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,440
but honestly, it's not enough. Even with

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,440
a solid goal, most meetings stumble at

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,840
the next critical step. Have you ever

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,280
attended a meeting where you spent the

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
first 15 minutes or more just trying to

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,840
figure out what's going on? Here's a

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,799
powerful fix that changes the whole

93
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,159
dynamic of meetings.

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,920
Send or request the context ahead of

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,640
time. Great meetings don't just have a

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,360
clear objective. They have a thoughtful,

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,920
structured plan. Your goal is to make

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,159
sure people arrive ready to have a

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
productive conversation right away from

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,799
the first minute or two. To make this

101
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,280
easier, I recommend that you provide the

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,479
following things ahead of time, ideally

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,320
a day or two before. a concise agenda

104
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,639
highlighting the key questions or

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,440
decisions you're going to make. A quick

106
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,360
summary or a link to a project brief, or

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,280
any other background information. I'll

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
explain later how a meeting agent can

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,360
support you on this one. Clearly stated

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,440
decisions you plan to make during the

111
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,000
meeting. This can be a short Loom video,

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,840
a Zoom clip, an audio message

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
summarizing the progress you've made up

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,000
until now, the expectations you have for

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the meeting. Now, I know this might feel

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
like you're assigning homework, but

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,400
trust me, the payoff is so worth it. But

118
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,320
again, what if you're not the host? What

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,120
if you're not fully in control? Even

120
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,280
then, I encourage you. Don't hesitate to

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,520
be proactive. You're just asking a

122
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,840
simple question. Is there anything I

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,320
should review or think about beforehand?

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,960
Here's my secret weapon for effortlessly

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,080
managing this step. Use an AI meeting

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,759
agent like Otter AI to streamline that

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,919
preparation. Start by creating a

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,240
dedicated space or channel for each

129
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,400
recurring meeting. Then simply chat with

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,960
your AI assistant beforehand. It will

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,120
help you quickly pull key insights or

132
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
reminders from previous conversations.

133
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,360
Or you can just talk to it and use it as

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,639
a thought partner. Imagine being able to

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,440
instantly retrieve any important detail

136
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,639
from past meetings just by asking your

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,639
AI agent for them. Okay, now that

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,400
everyone's prepared, you're ready for a

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
productive meeting. But there's one

140
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,520
other common trap that still threatens

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,759
your ability to focus and capture key

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,479
insights during the conversation. Next,

143
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,520
I'll share exactly how to stay fully

144
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,039
present while also not missing any

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,520
little thing. Tip number three, let your

146
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,199
AI notetaker do the heavy lifting. Have

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,240
you ever found yourself in a meeting

148
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,479
trying to simultaneously listen, engage,

149
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,440
and frantically take notes? Here's the

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,960
truth. Multitasking is a myth. When you

151
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,479
try to split your attention, both tasks

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,440
suffer a lot. So what's the solution? AI

153
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,600
tools and now agents like Otter AI

154
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,680
automatically handle the easy part, the

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
note-taking part, so you can give your

156
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
full attention to the conversation. You

157
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,919
can be present, ask insightful

158
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,960
questions, actively participate. Here's

159
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,520
exactly how you set it up in seconds.

160
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,440
Autoconnect your calendar to your AI

161
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,600
assistant. Preconfigure recurring

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
meetings so you never have to remember

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,479
to hit record. Add an integration with

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams.

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
Once it's set up, Otter joins your

166
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
meetings automatically. It provides you

167
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,680
with detailed notes, summaries,

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
actionable highlights. You can even

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,639
create custom note templates to make

170
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,960
sure that Otter captures exactly what's

171
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,360
most relevant for different types of

172
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,680
meetings. One more thing, before you

173
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,919
activate your AI assistant or agent,

174
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
always make sure your participants are

175
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,639
comfortable with it beforehand. By the

176
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,199
way, Otter doesn't record video. It only

177
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,680
captures audio and takes screenshots of

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,160
shared screens for context. These

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,720
screenshots become helpful references

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
later on, especially when you're

181
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,759
reviewing notes or chatting with Otter

182
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,319
AI to clarify what happened in the

183
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,160
meeting. Your AI is taking notes. The

184
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,639
discussion is flowing, but the meeting

185
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,720
isn't over yet. So many people drop the

186
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,039
ball right at the end, right when

187
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,599
they're at the finish line. Tip number

188
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,360
four, end every meeting with clarity.

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,360
We've all been there. The conversation

190
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,880
was productive. The meeting is coming to

191
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,000
an end, but then everyone just logs off.

192
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,560
There's no recap, no next steps, no

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,800
clarity. This little mistake is a big

194
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,039
mistake. It's the silent killer of

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
productivity. Everyone leaves thinking

196
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,879
something different, concluding

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
something different, and any momentum

198
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,560
that you created in that conversation

199
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,840
just disappears. Here's a powerful

200
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,400
solution. Always end every meeting by

201
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,879
explicitly summarizing decisions. And

202
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,199
not just decisions, but the action

203
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,360
items, assigning the action items that

204
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,440
come from those decisions. It just takes

205
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,520
one or two minutes. But here's how you

206
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,919
can do it. Just before you close, say

207
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,520
something like, "Okay." And just to wrap

208
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,840
up, we'll have three videos. And what we

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,279
will do from our side, we're going to

210
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,479
create a few varieties of uh hooks and

211
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,959
intros for each one. This little habit

212
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,959
makes sure that everyone has clarity.

213
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,519
There's not just individual

214
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,720
accountability, but shared

215
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,440
accountability. There's no confusion.

216
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,080
There's no wasted effort. Even better,

217
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,360
your meeting assistant, such as Otter,

218
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,000
can help capture these important wrap-up

219
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
moments precisely. This saves time, but

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600
more importantly, it ensures that

221
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
everyone is on the same page and not

222
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
forgetting any crucial details. But how

223
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,760
can you guarantee that all these action

224
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,959
items actually happen once everyone logs

225
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,240
off? Tip number five, follow up every

226
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,240
single time. All right, we're at the

227
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
end. You've had a great meeting.

228
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
Decisions were made. Plans were set.

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,120
Everyone seemed on board. But there's

230
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,399
still a big question. Does anything

231
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,560
actually happen afterward? If no one

232
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,720
follows up, your meetings can become

233
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,200
these meaningless calendar blocks that

234
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,320
just disappear without any impact.

235
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Always follow up immediately after the

236
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,040
meeting every single time. This is where

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,480
an AI agent like Otter AI truly shines.

238
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,080
It helps turn meetings into measurable,

239
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,480
explicit actions and tangible outcomes.

240
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,279
Here's exactly how you do it. Step one,

241
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,839
check your meeting summary. See, Otter

242
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,360
automatically creates a summary

243
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,920
highlighting the key points and the

244
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,320
agreed upon action items. Step two,

245
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
share your follow-up immediately. With

246
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,880
one click, you can share that summary

247
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,399
along with any edits you've made with

248
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,320
everyone who attended or any

249
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,120
stakeholders. I really recommend you do

250
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,160
this very soon after the meeting. It's

251
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,800
so crucial. Step three, clarify any

252
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,839
details with AI chat. If anything is

253
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,880
unclear, you can ask Otter's builtin

254
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,720
chatbot questions. Your AI agent can

255
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,120
pull answers directly from the meeting

256
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,760
notes and give you responses to whatever

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,320
you're not clear about. Step four, turn

258
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
action items into real tasks. For

259
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,360
maximum effectiveness, I recommend you

260
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,160
transfer your assigned tasks, the ones

261
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,959
you're responsible for, into your

262
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,279
personal task manager or calendar and

263
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,720
add deadlines. There you have it, my

264
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,680
five proven best practices that have

265
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,560
transformed the way that I run meetings.

266
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,720
I genuinely recommend trying Otter. My

267
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,920
team and I have personally relied on it

268
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,320
since, if you can believe this, 2019.

269
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,360
It's incredibly simple to set up, simple

270
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,360
to use, and I promise will transform

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,240
your meetings forever. Like and comment
