Have you ever sat through a meeting and thought, "Why am I even here?" You are not alone. Most meetings drain your energy. They clutter your schedule. They leave you wondering if there's a better way. Well, there is. And in this video, I'm going to share five powerful meeting strategies that I have refined and tested over a decade to help you run meetings that are shorter, smarter, and actually worth your time. I'll even show you exactly how I leverage Otter.ai, an AI powered meeting agent to make these strategies effortless. Let's get [Music] started. If you're new here, hi, I'm Thiago Forte. I've helped thousands of people organize their digital lives and maximize their productivity through my best-selling book and online course, Building a Second Brain. It doesn't matter what your role is, your team, where you work, what kind of company or organization. Meetings reveal things. They reveal the clarity of your thinking, your level of preparation, your ability to get things done. But first, let's answer the crucial and often overlooked question. Does this even need to be a meeting? Modern work environments present a huge challenge. What's the best way to communicate? Is it a quick Slack messages, a detailed email, or do we actually need a meeting? According to a recent Harvard Business Review study, reducing the number of meetings by 40% boosted productivity and employee satisfaction by over 70%. That means one of the best ways to make meetings better is to have fewer of them. Here's the principle I recommend. always default to the simplest, fastest method of communication unless the situation demands more. I use the 3S test to decide quickly. First, sensitivity. Is the topic emotionally charged or is it easy to misinterpret? Second is scope. How many people are involved? How complex is it? And third is stakes. What's at risk? What's the downside if this issue is misunderstood or delayed? The higher the sensitivity, the greater the scope or the number of people involved, or the higher the stakes, the more valuable, the more important a meeting becomes. Let's dive into the single biggest meeting mistake most people overlook. My first tip is to have a clear objective. They don't actually know why they're meeting. Never ever start a meeting without a clearly defined objective. Before you even send out a calendar invite, you need to know exactly what decision needs to be made after this meeting. What problem or obstacle or challenge are you trying to solve? What's the exact outcome that you want from this meeting? You can make each of these three points crystal clear by including them directly in the calendar invite. You'll immediately notice that all the participants arrive more focused, more prepared, more ready to answer those questions that you've posed. But what if you're not the one hosting? Here's my advice. Never automatically just accept a meeting invite without asking about its purpose first. A simple reply asking, "What is the purpose of this meeting?" can significantly improve the whole experience and the outcome. Sometimes it even helps the host realize you don't even need a meeting at all. Okay, so having a clear objective is essential, but honestly, it's not enough. Even with a solid goal, most meetings stumble at the next critical step. Have you ever attended a meeting where you spent the first 15 minutes or more just trying to figure out what's going on? Here's a powerful fix that changes the whole dynamic of meetings. Send or request the context ahead of time. Great meetings don't just have a clear objective. They have a thoughtful, structured plan. Your goal is to make sure people arrive ready to have a productive conversation right away from the first minute or two. To make this easier, I recommend that you provide the following things ahead of time, ideally a day or two before. a concise agenda highlighting the key questions or decisions you're going to make. A quick summary or a link to a project brief, or any other background information. I'll explain later how a meeting agent can support you on this one. Clearly stated decisions you plan to make during the meeting. This can be a short Loom video, a Zoom clip, an audio message summarizing the progress you've made up until now, the expectations you have for the meeting. Now, I know this might feel like you're assigning homework, but trust me, the payoff is so worth it. But again, what if you're not the host? What if you're not fully in control? Even then, I encourage you. Don't hesitate to be proactive. You're just asking a simple question. Is there anything I should review or think about beforehand? Here's my secret weapon for effortlessly managing this step. Use an AI meeting agent like Otter AI to streamline that preparation. Start by creating a dedicated space or channel for each recurring meeting. Then simply chat with your AI assistant beforehand. It will help you quickly pull key insights or reminders from previous conversations. Or you can just talk to it and use it as a thought partner. Imagine being able to instantly retrieve any important detail from past meetings just by asking your AI agent for them. Okay, now that everyone's prepared, you're ready for a productive meeting. But there's one other common trap that still threatens your ability to focus and capture key insights during the conversation. Next, I'll share exactly how to stay fully present while also not missing any little thing. Tip number three, let your AI notetaker do the heavy lifting. Have you ever found yourself in a meeting trying to simultaneously listen, engage, and frantically take notes? Here's the truth. Multitasking is a myth. When you try to split your attention, both tasks suffer a lot. So what's the solution? AI tools and now agents like Otter AI automatically handle the easy part, the note-taking part, so you can give your full attention to the conversation. You can be present, ask insightful questions, actively participate. Here's exactly how you set it up in seconds. Autoconnect your calendar to your AI assistant. Preconfigure recurring meetings so you never have to remember to hit record. Add an integration with Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams. Once it's set up, Otter joins your meetings automatically. It provides you with detailed notes, summaries, actionable highlights. You can even create custom note templates to make sure that Otter captures exactly what's most relevant for different types of meetings. One more thing, before you activate your AI assistant or agent, always make sure your participants are comfortable with it beforehand. By the way, Otter doesn't record video. It only captures audio and takes screenshots of shared screens for context. These screenshots become helpful references later on, especially when you're reviewing notes or chatting with Otter AI to clarify what happened in the meeting. Your AI is taking notes. The discussion is flowing, but the meeting isn't over yet. So many people drop the ball right at the end, right when they're at the finish line. Tip number four, end every meeting with clarity. We've all been there. The conversation was productive. The meeting is coming to an end, but then everyone just logs off. There's no recap, no next steps, no clarity. This little mistake is a big mistake. It's the silent killer of productivity. Everyone leaves thinking something different, concluding something different, and any momentum that you created in that conversation just disappears. Here's a powerful solution. Always end every meeting by explicitly summarizing decisions. And not just decisions, but the action items, assigning the action items that come from those decisions. It just takes one or two minutes. But here's how you can do it. Just before you close, say something like, "Okay." And just to wrap up, we'll have three videos. And what we will do from our side, we're going to create a few varieties of uh hooks and intros for each one. This little habit makes sure that everyone has clarity. There's not just individual accountability, but shared accountability. There's no confusion. There's no wasted effort. Even better, your meeting assistant, such as Otter, can help capture these important wrap-up moments precisely. This saves time, but more importantly, it ensures that everyone is on the same page and not forgetting any crucial details. But how can you guarantee that all these action items actually happen once everyone logs off? Tip number five, follow up every single time. All right, we're at the end. You've had a great meeting. Decisions were made. Plans were set. Everyone seemed on board. But there's still a big question. Does anything actually happen afterward? If no one follows up, your meetings can become these meaningless calendar blocks that just disappear without any impact. Always follow up immediately after the meeting every single time. This is where an AI agent like Otter AI truly shines. It helps turn meetings into measurable, explicit actions and tangible outcomes. Here's exactly how you do it. Step one, check your meeting summary. See, Otter automatically creates a summary highlighting the key points and the agreed upon action items. Step two, share your follow-up immediately. With one click, you can share that summary along with any edits you've made with everyone who attended or any stakeholders. I really recommend you do this very soon after the meeting. It's so crucial. Step three, clarify any details with AI chat. If anything is unclear, you can ask Otter's builtin chatbot questions. Your AI agent can pull answers directly from the meeting notes and give you responses to whatever you're not clear about. Step four, turn action items into real tasks. For maximum effectiveness, I recommend you transfer your assigned tasks, the ones you're responsible for, into your personal task manager or calendar and add deadlines. There you have it, my five proven best practices that have transformed the way that I run meetings. I genuinely recommend trying Otter. My team and I have personally relied on it since, if you can believe this, 2019. It's incredibly simple to set up, simple to use, and I promise will transform your meetings forever.
