Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. See, there is a rule of geopolitics, never go full Pakistan, US just went full Pakistan. Now here you will be able to see the article, the US Army General has given big statements about Pakistan, he said that Pakistan is a phenomenal partner in fighting terrorism and here he also said that we need good relations with both India and Pakistan, it is not the case that in order to improve relations with India, we will spoil the relations with Pakistan. We will have good relations with both of them.  And these statements of the US General actually completely counter many of the statements of India and the United Nations. US Generals are openly defending Pakistan.  It was even said that Pakistan's record in fighting terrorism is very good and after this a report also comes that the current Army Chief of Pakistan, Asim Munir, has now become the Field Marshal of Pakistan. They will be invited to the US for Trump's Military Day Parade.  This is a very important symbolic gesture.  I told you in a very important video.  I don't know why this video didn't get so many views. But this was really an important video.  In this I explained to you that Trump literally saved Pakistan from a travel ban.  And apart from that why today the money Bitcoin is playing a critical role in the pro-Pakistan policies of Donald Trump.  And you have to note one thing, Donald Trump is constantly praising the leadership of Pakistan. Many videos have surfaced in which Trump has said, I know some people don't like it when I say this.  But the leadership of Pakistan is very good.  You should watch this clip and then we will talk about the rest of the developments that are taking place today.  Obviously all this has a very deep link with the F35. Very important developments are taking place related to the F35 fighter jet. Many articles are being published.  I will show you that as well.  But just have a view of what statements Donald Trump has given lately about Pakistan. And Pakistan like wise they leadership near like when I say. Now this statement was by US President Donald Trump.  Now you will see what statement the Army General of the US Central Command will give, regarding Pakistan, this is a very important video, it also went viral recently in the Indian diplomatic circles, you will be able to see it here, but most active to do externally globally, if I there put there Pakistan border partnership, Pakistan gave after ice to them relationship, we have them providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ice Kosan high individuals, they are extra back Zafar, who is one of the key individuals behind the egging, now this Zafar, about whom we are talking, is a terrorist who was handed back by Pakistan to the US, I will admit that Pakistan has figured out how to please Donald Trump?  Whether it's from bitcoin investments or just a random terrorist getting caught.  It was immediately sent to the US and this gave Donald Trump an opportunity to say that look, we have caught a terrorist here.  Pakistan is playing USA very well.  But USA clearly is now adopting a pro-Pakistan approach, it might backfire big time.  Because just today the FBI chief Kash Patel gave a statement that a man from Pakistan was about to carry out a major terrorist attack in the USA and he was stopped.  Here you will see that this is the same country which the US is saying is a very much a USA friendly country and will help USA in fighting terrorism.  FBI Director Kash Patel has said that major news earlier this afternoon, Mohammad Shahzab Khan, a Pakistani citizen, again this is the official tweet by the FBI Director Kash Patel, a Pakistani citizen who was living in Canada was extradited from the USA on charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS. Now imagine, the Army Chief of the US Central Command says that Pakistan is helping them to fight ISIS, on the other hand, a Pakistani citizen sitting in Canada, where, as you know, there are a lot of NTD activities in Canada. There it is supporting ISIS so that terrorism can be carried out.  Here you can see in the fall last year Khan legitimately planned to travel from Canada to New York to carry out a mass shooting in support of ISS at a JASS center in Brooklyn.  This is the condition of Pakistan that such people are coming out from here who are going to carry out such attacks in the USA. And I have to say unfortunately.  I mean it seems that the US will learn from a big mistake because the problem with the US is that they start to believe from one or two gestures from Pakistan that the terrorists and the fundamentalists in Pakistan are different and their army and their government are different.  Whereas the images of funerals that have emerged after Operation Sindoor are from Pakistan.  This clearly proves their army and their government. All these people support the terrorists.  It is not that Pakistan's army is different.  I mean Indians know this. Even the peace loving people in Afghanistan know this. I would say that the US is about to make a huge strategic blunder.  And if you are asking why US can make such a blunder ?  I think, somewhere in this, they are also giving a little reply to India by improving relations with Pakistan.  The reason behind this is simple.  Now see, slowly this news has started coming from India that India is not going to purchase F35. I had told you earlier also that Donald Trump must have been informed about this long ago and that is why he is continuously giving absurd statements about Kashmir.  About India Pakistan relations because USA had made a heavy push for F35 Farjet.  So India is not even considering this proposal to acquire F35.  The talk is that either we will build the AMCA faster and at the same time we may acquire Russian SU 57 fighter jets. Look, this will be considered a big blunder on the part of Donald Trump's administration that it could not convince India to purchase F35.  India is again going to purchase Russian weapons on a large scale and this deal is going to be a mega deal and the impact of this deal will be felt in the region for many years, so now see in the coming times, to tell India also that now it is okay, then Pakistan is also as important for us as India is important. Such statements will come.  US media may also become a little hostile against India.  But right now the US has chosen this path.  Even if you look into the past, whatever dictators have come to Pakistan, the US has welcomed them very much. Called to the White House.  Gave a lot of respect.   It seems that Asim Munir will also go to the US very soon and he will be welcomed in the same manner there too. All this is going to happen.  But in the end it remains to be seen whether the US will regret this policy or not. Because the country they are supporting has a proven track record of supporting terrorists.  So in the coming times, you will see very strange scenes. Asim Anil will go to US. It will have a very grand welcome.  Trump will welcome this and it seems USA has decided what to do.  So this is interesting.  But again, we still stand by the decision we took to put this Soul Treaty into absence. Many of Pakistan's air bases have been destroyed and Pakistan is searching from door to door to get a good air defence system because HQ Nine is not working.  Overall India has the upper hand.  But what has to be seen here is that since US has now become so pro-Pakistan. So tomorrow when we resume Operation Sindoor then what statements will come from USA at that time.  That will be very interesting to see whether the US all together will start spoiling its relations with India for the sake of Pakistan and not this will be very interesting to see. There will be many developments related to this to come. I will make updated videos for you all.
