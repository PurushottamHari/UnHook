00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,320
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,800
Prashant Dhawan. See, there is a rule of geopolitics, never go

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,559
full Pakistan, US just went

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,920
full Pakistan. Now here you will be

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,320
able to see the article, the US

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,359
Army General has given big statements about Pakistan, he

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,039
said that Pakistan is a phenomenal

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,599
partner in fighting terrorism and here he

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,119
also said that we need good relations

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,079
with both India and Pakistan, it is

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,640
not the case that in order to improve relations with India, we will

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
spoil the relations with Pakistan.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
We will have good relations with both of

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,920
them.  And these statements of the US General

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
actually

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
completely counter many of the statements of India and the United Nations.

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,600
US Generals are openly

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,800
defending Pakistan.  It was even said

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,360
that Pakistan's record

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,079
in fighting terrorism is very good and after this a

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,640
report also comes that the current

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
Army Chief of Pakistan, Asim Munir, has now become the

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
Field Marshal of Pakistan.

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,680
They will be invited to the US for

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,760
Trump's Military Day Parade.  This is a very

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
important symbolic gesture.  I

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
told you in a very important

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
video.  I don't know why this video didn't get so many views.

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,119
But this was really an

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,240
important video.  In this I

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,119
explained to you that Trump literally

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,320
saved Pakistan from a travel ban.  And

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,560
apart from that why today the money Bitcoin is

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
playing a critical role

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,920
in the pro-Pakistan policies of Donald Trump.  And you have to

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,640
note one thing, Donald Trump is constantly

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,960
praising the leadership of Pakistan.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,360
Many videos have surfaced in

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,799
which Trump has said, I know some

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
people don't like it when I

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,600
say this.  But the leadership of Pakistan is very

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,280
good.  You should watch this clip and then

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,280
we will talk about the rest of the developments that are taking place today.  Obviously all this has

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,000
a very deep link with the F35.

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
Very important developments are taking place related to the F35 fighter jet.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
Many

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
articles are being published.  I will

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,640
show you that as well.  But just have a view of

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,680
what statements Donald Trump has given lately

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,760
about Pakistan.

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:20,599
And Pakistan like wise they

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,599
leadership near like when I say.

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,920
Now this statement was by US President

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,640
Donald Trump.  Now you will see

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,800
what statement the Army General of the US Central Command will

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,800
give, regarding Pakistan,

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
this is a very important video, it

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,640
also went viral recently in the Indian diplomatic

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,640
circles, you will be able to see it here,

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,640
but most active to do externally globally,

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,640
if

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,800
I there put there

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Pakistan border

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
partnership, Pakistan gave after ice to them

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,560
 

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,440
relationship, we have them providing

68
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,519
intelligence, they have captured at least five

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,840
ice Kosan high individuals, they are extra

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,040
back Zafar, who is one of the key individuals

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,879
behind the egging, now this Zafar, about whom we are talking, is a

72
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
terrorist who was handed

73
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,720
back by Pakistan to the US, I will admit that

74
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Pakistan has figured out

75
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
how to please Donald Trump?  Whether it's

76
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,599
from bitcoin investments or just a

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
random terrorist getting caught.  It was immediately

78
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,280
sent to the US and this gave Donald Trump an

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
opportunity to say that look, we have

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,560
caught a terrorist here.  Pakistan

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,440
is playing USA very well.  But

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,440
USA clearly is now adopting a pro-Pakistan

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,480
approach, it might

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,400
backfire big time.  Because just today the FBI

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,120
chief Kash Patel gave a statement

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,519
that a man from Pakistan was about to carry out a

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,319
major terrorist attack in the USA and he was

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,480
stopped.  Here you will see that this is the same country

89
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,799
which the US is saying is a very much

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,040
a USA friendly country and

91
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,439
will help USA in fighting terrorism.  FBI

92
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,959
Director Kash Patel has said that major news

93
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,519
earlier this afternoon, Mohammad Shahzab Khan,

94
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,760
a Pakistani citizen, again this is the official

95
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,959
tweet by the FBI Director Kash Patel,

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,840
a Pakistani citizen who was living in Canada was

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,160
extradited from the USA

98
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,440
on charges of attempting to provide

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,240
material support to ISIS. Now imagine, the

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,400
Army Chief of the US Central Command says

101
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,639
that Pakistan is

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,280
helping them to fight ISIS, on the other hand, a

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
Pakistani citizen sitting in Canada, where,

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
as you know, there are

105
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
a lot of NTD activities in Canada.

106
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,360
There it is supporting ISIS

107
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
so that terrorism can be carried out.  Here you

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
can see in the fall last year Khan legitimately

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,720
planned to travel from Canada to New York

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,520
to carry out a mass shooting in support of

111
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,080
ISS at a JASS center in Brooklyn.  This is the

112
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
condition of Pakistan that such people are coming out from here

113
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
who are going to carry out such attacks in the USA.

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,000
And I

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,120
have to say unfortunately.  I mean it seems

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,240
that the US will learn from a big mistake

117
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,960
because the problem with the US is that

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,520
they start to believe from one or two gestures from Pakistan that the

119
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,000

120
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,080
terrorists and the fundamentalists in Pakistan are

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
different and their army and

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,240
their government are different.  Whereas the

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,160

124
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
images of funerals that have emerged after Operation Sindoor are from Pakistan.  This

125
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
clearly proves their army and their government.

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,800
All these people support the terrorists.  It is

127
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,039
not that

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,919
Pakistan's army is different.  I mean

129
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,639
Indians know this.

130
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,720
Even the peace loving people in Afghanistan know this.

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,800
I would say that the US is about to make a huge

132
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
strategic blunder.  And if

133
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,080
you are asking why US can make such a blunder

134
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,479
?  I think, somewhere in this, they are

135
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,400
also giving a little reply to India by

136
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,479
improving relations with Pakistan.  The

137
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,039
reason behind this is simple.  Now see,

138
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,000
slowly this news has started coming from India

139
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,600
that India is not going to purchase F35.

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,080
I had told you earlier also

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,479
that Donald Trump must have been informed about this long

142
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
ago and that is why he is continuously

143
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,479
giving absurd statements

144
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,800
about Kashmir.  About India Pakistan relations

145
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,080
because USA had made a heavy push

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,880
for F35 Farjet.  So

147
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,759

148
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,199
India is not even considering this proposal to acquire F35.  The talk is

149
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,479
that either we will build the AMCA faster

150
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,360
and at the same time

151
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,280
we may acquire Russian SU 57 fighter jets.

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
Look, this will be considered

153
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,240
a big blunder on the part of Donald Trump's administration

154
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,280
that it could not convince India to

155
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,840
purchase F35.  India is again going to

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,400
purchase Russian weapons on a large scale

157
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,199
and this deal is going to be a mega deal

158
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,520
and the impact of this deal will be felt in the region for many years,

159
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
so now

160
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,160
see in the coming times, to

161
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,919
tell India also that now it is

162
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
okay, then Pakistan is also as important for us

163
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,599
as India is important.

164
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,680
Such statements will come.  US media

165
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,080
may also become a little hostile

166
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
against India.  But right now the US has

167
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,319
chosen this path.  Even if you

168
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,880
look into the past, whatever dictators have come to Pakistan, the

169
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,880
US has welcomed them very much.

170
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,400
Called to the White House.  Gave a lot of respect.   It

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,479
seems that Asim Munir will also go to the US very soon

172
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,479
and he will be welcomed in the same manner there too.

173
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,840
All this is going to

174
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,400
happen.  But in the end it remains to be seen whether the

175
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,560
US will regret this policy or not.

176
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,720
Because the country they are supporting has a

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,039
proven track record of

178
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
supporting terrorists.  So

179
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,039
in the coming times, you will see very strange scenes.

180
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,840
Asim Anil will go to US.

181
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,720
It will have a very grand welcome.  Trump will

182
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,360
welcome this and it seems USA has

183
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,160
decided what to do.  So this is

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,720
interesting.  But again, we

185
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,720

186
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,039
still stand by the decision we took to put this Soul Treaty into absence.

187
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
Many of Pakistan's air bases have been

188
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,039
destroyed and Pakistan is

189
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
searching from door to door to get a good air defence

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,280
system because HQ

191
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,280
Nine is not working.  Overall India has the

192
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,759
upper hand.  But what has to be seen here is

193
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,960
that since US has now become so pro-Pakistan.

194
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,520
So tomorrow when we resume Operation Sindoor

195
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,199
then

196
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,919
what statements will come from USA at that time.  That will be very

197
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,479
interesting to see whether the US all together will

198
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,720
start spoiling its relations with India

199
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,720
for the sake of Pakistan and not this will be

200
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
very interesting to see. There will be

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
many developments related to this to come.

202
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,879
I will make updated videos for you all.

203
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
See, sometime go to any website

204
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,760
where companies post jobs and you will

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,479
notice there that the demand for data analysts is

206
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,880
continuously increasing.  Whether you are

207
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,680
in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata or

208
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,519
anywhere, salaries obviously range based

209
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,160
on your experience.  But you

210
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,920

211
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
can easily earn even Rs 50,600 per month from 2025.  Depending on your

212
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,760
experience, depending on your skills.  And the

213
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,440
impact of data analysts is being

214
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,920
seen in every industry.  It will obviously be seen in the corporate world.

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,160
Apart from that,

216
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,160
articles are being published in medical science and even cricket.

217
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,320
This is a four day old

218
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,640
article about how data

219
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,880
analytics has transformed cricket all together.

220
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,600
I will tell you the reason.  Let

221
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,000
me show you for the first time

222
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,040

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,680
how someone can present data if they have the skills of a data analyst.

224
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,560
Once you have the

225
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,600
skills of a data analyst, you can create all of these things.

226
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,720
You will be able to see in what beautiful way the

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,959
profit of a company and

228
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,360
how much revenue a company earned in which month.

229
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,920
What is the market share?  This can be made in detail.

230
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,279
Again it's not just like you

231
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,760
just choose a color scheme and

232
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,399
enter the data.  In this, the formulas, the

233
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,640
way you enter the data, the way

234
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,279
you present the data, everything matters.

235
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,160
And companies today are

236
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,640
ready to pay people who present the data to them in

237
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,040
such a way and in such a form

238
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,120
so that the companies can decide

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,680
what to do in the future.

240
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,560
Where do they want to go in the future?

241
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,880

245
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,720
