00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
Prashant Dhawan. Now, in the last one or two months, the

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,040
things that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth, the

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,519
statements that have come, after listening to all this,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,240
many Indians wanted that PM Modi should

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,439
reject Trump's invitation for once and

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,240
recently India has done this, India has

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,160
finally given a proper reply to Donald Trump,

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,039
here you will be able to see that

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,439
Prime Minister Modi has declined

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,000
Donald Trump's invitation to meet in

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,239
US due to the pre-existing schedule.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,480
Our Foreign Ministry Secretary

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,600
Vikram Misri Sahib has openly

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,480
said this to the world that look,

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,000
PM Modi went to Canada to attend the G7 Summit.  Now

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,879
as I told you in a previous video,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,960
Donald Trump had

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,520
made a mockery of the G7 summit.  First,

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,840
Emmanuel Makhana was targeted openly.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
After that he

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,160
made very bad comments about the leaders of the host country, Canada,

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,399
and finally said that I have some work and

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,479
I am going to finish the summit quickly and leave from here.

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,119
Now due to this reason the meeting between Donald Trump and

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,760
PM Modi could not take place in Canada.

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,320
Now Trump called PM Modi on his behalf.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,880
Both the

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,119
leaders discussed various issues for more than 30 minutes and

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,439
Trump told Modiji that you are

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,600
already in Canada.  Canada shares a US border.  The

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,520
US is very close by and you have to

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
come to Washington DC which is

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,759
very close, it will be just

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,320
a few hours flight from the Canadian border.  Come here,

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,320
we will welcome you.  PM Modi

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,640
rejected it saying that we still have other

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
plans and we cannot change them.  And let

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,079
me tell you this is a very

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,720
strong message from India to don Trump

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,960
because you know, I know.  If

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,119
Donald Trump had not said all the things

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,200
he has said recently.  To repeatedly

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,240
emphasise that it was they who had

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,560
ordered the ceasefire.  Then tell them that

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,399
I will get the thousands of years old issue of Kashmir resolved.

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,719
He has given strange statements recently.  Then he even said

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,880
that the government of Pakistan is doing very good

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,360
work.  Pakistan is a very good

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,759
supporter of USA in fighting terrorism.

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,479
All these things that Trump has said, let

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,319
me tell you that Trump has killed all his

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
goodwill in India.  I will

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,640
not be surprised when

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,120
Trump comes to India to attend the Quad Summit.

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,280
If he comes, he is not given any special welcome

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
and in this particular case,

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
look, I like this thing, the

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
communication is much better.  Otherwise,

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,160
usually our style is to

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,120
convey some message of the Indian Government in India, some PIB notification

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,040
came, and that too was released after two-three days,

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,840
by the time the news had cooled down,

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,480
our Foreign Secretary himself came here

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
openly and explained what had happened, he made three-four

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,440
big statements here,

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,760
Trump had already left the G7 summit,

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,560
you might remember in G7 also, Trump had even

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,120
said that make China a member,

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,519
make G8 of G7, G9, so anyway, after saying all this,

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,040
Trump left and then on Donald Trump's

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,720
request, a phone call was placed between PM Modi and

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,599
Donald Trump.  Listen to this clip, I had to

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,599
return to America early

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:09,120
due to which this meeting could not take place.

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:13,200
After this, at the request of President Trump,

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,239
both the leaders talked on the phone today.  The conversation

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,480
lasted about 35 minutes.  Now after this, see

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
here Misri Sahab will also tell you about

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
a big lie of Trump, I mean now look,

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
no one will say openly that Trump was lying

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,120
but listen to this line, he has clearly

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,360
told here that after the Pahalgam attack happened, there was a

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,920
talk between Mr Trump and PM Modi, there was no

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,239
talk during Operation Sindoor,

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,159
now directly from the time of Pahalgam attack till

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
in the middle of all this, there was no talk between Mr Trump and PM

90
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,799
Modi,

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,159
condolences were expressed to Prime Minister Modi

92
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,760
and support was expressed against terrorism.

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,440
This was the first conversation between the two leaders after that.

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,720
Therefore, Prime Minister Modi

95
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,760

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,239
talked to President Trump in detail about Operation Sindoor.  This

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,720
is a huge detail.  This literally exposes Trump's lie

98
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,360
that

99
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,959
during "You know, Operation Sindoor", Trump did

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
not talk to PM Modi.  Here the

101
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,000
blood of JD Vance that he brought to India is

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,040
different.  Prime Minister Modi

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
clearly told President Trump that after April 22,

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,280
India had conveyed to the

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,400
entire world its determination to take action against terrorism.

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Prime Minister Modi

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,960
said that on the night of 6-7 May, India had

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,240

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,000
targeted only terrorist hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,840
India's actions were very measured,

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,240
precise and non-escalatory.

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,360
India also made it clear that it would

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,680
respond to Pakistan's bullets with shells.  On the

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,080
night of May 9, Vice President Vance

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,199
called Prime Minister Modi.

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,680
Vice President Vas had said that Pakistan

117
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,919
could launch a major attack on India.

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,280
Prime Minister Modi had told him in clear words

119
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,800
that if this happens then India will

120
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,000
give an even bigger reply to Pakistan.  On the

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,560
night of 9-10 May,

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,039
India gave a very strong response to Pakistan's attack and

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,680

124
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,960
caused heavy damage to the Pakistani army.  Its military airbases were

125
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,160
rendered inoperable.  Due to India's strong response,

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,880
Pakistan had to

127
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,440
request India to stop military action.

128
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,560
Prime Minister Modi

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,479
clearly told President Trump that during this entire incident, at no

130
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,919
level were issues like India-

131
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,960
US trade deal or mediation by the US

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,039
between India and Pakistan

133
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,880
discussed.  Again this is another

134
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,120
big lie of Trump has been exposed, which

135
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,000
Trump says that I used trade to

136
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,639
stop India-Pakistan,

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,440
India has clearly exposed whatever lie this is of Trump.  The

138
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,639

139
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,280
decision to halt military action was taken directly between India and

140
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,919
Pakistan

141
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,400
through existing channels between the two armies and

142
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,440
at the request of Pakistan.

143
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,039
Prime Minister Modi stressed that

144
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,319
India has never accepted

145
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,280
nor does it accept mediation and will never do so.  Please note that

146
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,720
Prime Minister Modi has stressed

147
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,520
that we have never

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,880
accepted intervention or mediation here nor will we do so.

149
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:41,039
This is an issue between India and Pakistan.  There is

150
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,000
complete political unanimity in India on this issue.

151
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,720
President Trump

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,080

153
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,039
understood the points made in detail by the Prime Minister and

154
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,080
expressed his support for India's fight against terrorism.

155
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,199
Prime Minister Modi also said that India

156
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,400
now views terrorism as a war and not a proxy war

157
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:06,240
and India's Operation

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,960
Sindoor is still continuing.  President Trump

159
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,319
asked Prime Minister Modi if he

160
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,120

161
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,160
could stop over in the US on his way back from Canada?  Due to pre-scheduled programmes,

162
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Prime Minister Modi expressed his inability.  The

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,000
two leaders then decided to

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,240
leave and expressed their inability.

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,120
Finally, while concluding this video, he

166
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
also said that he

167
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,520
also received an invitation from Trump saying let's meet and

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,280
talk.  PM Modi has

169
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,319
also rejected this.  And by the way, let me

170
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,479
tell you that tomorrow most probably Donald

171
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
Trump will meet Asim Munir.  Asim Munir has been

172
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,400
wandering in the USA for many days.  Some

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,880
initial reports also came that

174
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,199
he will attend the USA Military Day parade.

175
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,280
Later, definitely the US would

176
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680

177
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,440
not have been so happy with Pakistan's performance.  Regarding the attacks that are going on in Iran, the

178
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,360
US expects more

179
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,039
from Pakistan definitely.  So that's why

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
Asim Munir's invitation was

181
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,160
rejected at the last moment.  But still

182
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,319
Asim Munir will get to dine

183
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
with Donald Trump.  And as you people have already given,

184
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,840
Trump and people close to Trump are

185
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,160
giving statements that the

186
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,319
leadership of Pakistan is very good and there is a

187
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,879
lot of trust in Pakistan.  After that call Asim Munir for

188
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,039
lunch.  India which has been continuously saying

189
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
that Pakistan is the center of terrorism.

190
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,199
USA completely twisted the

191
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,759
whole thing and said that Pakistan

192
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,759
is a big support against terrorism

193
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,680
and now they are hosting Asim Munir for lunch.

194
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,599
This clearly shows Don

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,839
Trump's foreign policy.  In this

196
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,000
he has decided that for now

197
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,479
he will keep a very pro-Pakistan approach.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
At least I think until whatever Israel and US want to do in Iran is

199
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
completed.  After that I wo

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,800
n't be surprised.  Suddenly Pakistan will

202
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,640
again become an unimportant country for these people.

203
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,399
But here India

204
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,399
gave a very correct reply to Don Trump.  And now,

205
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
somewhere or the other, the US foreign

206
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,720
policy advisors, many of

207
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,440
his foreign policy experts in America itself, will ask Trump whether

208
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,839
he has damaged the relations with India.

209
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,959
Those relations were built in a way that

210
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,000
Barack Obama, I would say, even

211
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,040
George Bush and if you see, to some extent

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,680
Joe Biden also contributed in some way or the other.

213
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,920
Have you damaged that relationship so badly

214
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
to such a level that now

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,560
their Prime Minister does

216
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,399
not want to come to the US even for a few hours?  And there is another interesting

217
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,680
scene I want to show you.

218
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,839
When PM Modi met Emmanuel Machara during the G7 summit,

219
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,000
he jokingly said

220
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,600
that these days I see that you are

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
fighting even on Twitter.  I

222
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,240
told you in the previous video how

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,640
Trump called Emmanuel Machara an

224
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
attention hungry person.  In response to that,

225
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,120
Emmanuel Machara also replied to Trump.

226
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,680
A very recent picture of the G7 has

227
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,920
surfaced.  Where the US President and the

228
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,839
French President are openly targeting each other

229
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,160
on social media.  And

230
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,640
PM Modi also jokingly

231
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,399
highlighted this point here.  And the funny thing is that

232
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,040
when Emmanuel Machoun

233
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,440
himself posted the video of the highlights of the G7 summit on his Twitter

234
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,399
account, he also added the clip of PM Modi in it.

235
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,959
Here you will be able to see,

236
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:14,000
now days you are fighting on Twitter,

237
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,560
you are fighting on Twitter, so PM Modi also

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,800
understands what status Donald Trump is roaming around with these days.

239
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,680
You know every

240
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,519
world leader is responding to him and

241
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,920
reducing the stature of the US to a great extent,

242
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,240
constantly and I don't know honestly, look, you

243
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,480
know what Donald Trump's campaign was,

244
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,720
how different he was saying, I do

245
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
n't know what has happened to him, he has spoiled the

246
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,200
relations of the US with almost the whole world, he had

247
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,440

248
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,079
started targeting Elon Musk recently, then for

249
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,240
some time now, it seems that both of them are

250
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,320
continuing their friendship again and that too, don't know for

251
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,040
how long it will continue,

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,120
Trump's answer is very volatile nature

253
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,000
and I feel that the way he is

254
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,120
taking favours in these crypto

255
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,200
companies of Pakistan, Trump will be trapped for a long time in the

256
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,480
greed for money, such a rich man, such a billionaire

257
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,959
man, even after reaching such a big position,

258
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,360
his main concern is

259
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,920
how will my companies grow, how will the money come,

260
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,079
etc. and it is quite sad honestly now

261
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,560
here I would like to ask you people, do

262
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,440
you believe that did PM Modi do the

263
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,680
right thing by rejecting Donald Trump's invite

264
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,440
or not  Write

265
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,440
your thought process in the comment section again. You

266
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,399
can believe here that or not, maybe PM

267
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
Modi should have gone there, your reason

268
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,279
could be anything, but I would like to

269
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,760
know here what the majority of you people

270
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,440
think, since lakhs of people will watch this

271
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
video, most likely around 10 lakh

272
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
people watch the video, so I would like to know

273
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,920
here what is your opinion,

274
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,040
share your thoughts in the comment section.

275
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,200
I believe that if today you are

276
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,360
not using Artificial Intelligence

277
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,240
in your work, then you are living in some other era

278
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,640
because with the help of AI, you

279
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,959
can do many jobs.  You can make a lot of

280
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,720
money.  You can upskill yourself.

281
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,360
For example, suppose I

282
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,920
want to show that Captain America is

283
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,360

284
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,519
eating Vada Pav in a busy street of Mumbai.  And above it

285
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,880
is written in a very attractive text 'Yummy'.  So

286
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,600
I can do it easily by entering the correct PR.

287
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,160
And here you can see it was just that

288
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,880
easy.  Of which you can make many variants.

289
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,600
If I want to move this image,

290
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,680
I can do it in the way

291
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,079
you can see on your screen.

292
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,959
I can make this image move with the help of a lot of generative AI software.  I

293
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,279

294
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,079
can create a story.  I can pretty

295
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,040
much do anything.  And this is just one small, I

296
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,320
mean one very small, aspect of
