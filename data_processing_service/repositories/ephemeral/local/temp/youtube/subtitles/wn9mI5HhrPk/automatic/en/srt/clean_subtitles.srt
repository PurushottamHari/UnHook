Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, in the last one or two months, the things that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth, the statements that have come, after listening to all this, many Indians wanted that PM Modi should reject Trump's invitation for once and recently India has done this, India has finally given a proper reply to Donald Trump, here you will be able to see that Prime Minister Modi has declined Donald Trump's invitation to meet in US due to the pre-existing schedule. Our Foreign Ministry Secretary Vikram Misri Sahib has openly said this to the world that look, PM Modi went to Canada to attend the G7 Summit.  Now as I told you in a previous video, Donald Trump had made a mockery of the G7 summit.  First, Emmanuel Makhana was targeted openly. After that he made very bad comments about the leaders of the host country, Canada, and finally said that I have some work and I am going to finish the summit quickly and leave from here. Now due to this reason the meeting between Donald Trump and PM Modi could not take place in Canada. Now Trump called PM Modi on his behalf. Both the leaders discussed various issues for more than 30 minutes and Trump told Modiji that you are already in Canada.  Canada shares a US border.  The US is very close by and you have to come to Washington DC which is very close, it will be just a few hours flight from the Canadian border.  Come here, we will welcome you.  PM Modi rejected it saying that we still have other plans and we cannot change them.  And let me tell you this is a very strong message from India to don Trump because you know, I know.  If Donald Trump had not said all the things he has said recently.  To repeatedly emphasise that it was they who had ordered the ceasefire.  Then tell them that I will get the thousands of years old issue of Kashmir resolved. He has given strange statements recently.  Then he even said that the government of Pakistan is doing very good work.  Pakistan is a very good supporter of USA in fighting terrorism. All these things that Trump has said, let me tell you that Trump has killed all his goodwill in India.  I will not be surprised when Trump comes to India to attend the Quad Summit. If he comes, he is not given any special welcome and in this particular case, look, I like this thing, the communication is much better.  Otherwise, usually our style is to convey some message of the Indian Government in India, some PIB notification came, and that too was released after two-three days, by the time the news had cooled down, our Foreign Secretary himself came here openly and explained what had happened, he made three-four big statements here, Trump had already left the G7 summit, you might remember in G7 also, Trump had even said that make China a member, make G8 of G7, G9, so anyway, after saying all this, Trump left and then on Donald Trump's request, a phone call was placed between PM Modi and Donald Trump.  Listen to this clip, I had to return to America early due to which this meeting could not take place. After this, at the request of President Trump, both the leaders talked on the phone today.  The conversation lasted about 35 minutes.  Now after this, see here Misri Sahab will also tell you about a big lie of Trump, I mean now look, no one will say openly that Trump was lying but listen to this line, he has clearly told here that after the Pahalgam attack happened, there was a talk between Mr Trump and PM Modi, there was no talk during Operation Sindoor, now directly from the time of Pahalgam attack till in the middle of all this, there was no talk between Mr Trump and PM Modi, condolences were expressed to Prime Minister Modi and support was expressed against terrorism. This was the first conversation between the two leaders after that. Therefore, Prime Minister Modi talked to President Trump in detail about Operation Sindoor.  This is a huge detail.  This literally exposes Trump's lie that during "You know, Operation Sindoor", Trump did not talk to PM Modi.  Here the blood of JD Vance that he brought to India is different.  Prime Minister Modi clearly told President Trump that after April 22, India had conveyed to the entire world its determination to take action against terrorism. Prime Minister Modi said that on the night of 6-7 May, India had targeted only terrorist hideouts in Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. India's actions were very measured, precise and non-escalatory. India also made it clear that it would respond to Pakistan's bullets with shells.  On the night of May 9, Vice President Vance called Prime Minister Modi. Vice President Vas had said that Pakistan could launch a major attack on India. Prime Minister Modi had told him in clear words that if this happens then India will give an even bigger reply to Pakistan.  On the night of 9-10 May, India gave a very strong response to Pakistan's attack and caused heavy damage to the Pakistani army.  Its military airbases were rendered inoperable.  Due to India's strong response, Pakistan had to request India to stop military action. Prime Minister Modi clearly told President Trump that during this entire incident, at no level were issues like India- US trade deal or mediation by the US between India and Pakistan discussed.  Again this is another big lie of Trump has been exposed, which Trump says that I used trade to stop India-Pakistan, India has clearly exposed whatever lie this is of Trump.  The decision to halt military action was taken directly between India and Pakistan through existing channels between the two armies and at the request of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi stressed that India has never accepted nor does it accept mediation and will never do so.  Please note that Prime Minister Modi has stressed that we have never accepted intervention or mediation here nor will we do so. This is an issue between India and Pakistan.  There is complete political unanimity in India on this issue. President Trump understood the points made in detail by the Prime Minister and expressed his support for India's fight against terrorism. Prime Minister Modi also said that India now views terrorism as a war and not a proxy war and India's Operation Sindoor is still continuing.  President Trump asked Prime Minister Modi if he could stop over in the US on his way back from Canada?  Due to pre-scheduled programmes, Prime Minister Modi expressed his inability.  The two leaders then decided to leave and expressed their inability. Finally, while concluding this video, he also said that he also received an invitation from Trump saying let's meet and talk.  PM Modi has also rejected this.  And by the way, let me tell you that tomorrow most probably Donald Trump will meet Asim Munir.  Asim Munir has been wandering in the USA for many days.  Some initial reports also came that he will attend the USA Military Day parade. Later, definitely the US would not have been so happy with Pakistan's performance.  Regarding the attacks that are going on in Iran, the US expects more from Pakistan definitely.  So that's why Asim Munir's invitation was rejected at the last moment.  But still Asim Munir will get to dine with Donald Trump.  And as you people have already given, Trump and people close to Trump are giving statements that the leadership of Pakistan is very good and there is a lot of trust in Pakistan.  After that call Asim Munir for lunch.  India which has been continuously saying that Pakistan is the center of terrorism. USA completely twisted the whole thing and said that Pakistan is a big support against terrorism and now they are hosting Asim Munir for lunch. This clearly shows Don Trump's foreign policy.  In this he has decided that for now he will keep a very pro-Pakistan approach. At least I think until whatever Israel and US want to do in Iran is completed.  After that I wo n't be surprised.  Suddenly Pakistan will again become an unimportant country for these people. But here India gave a very correct reply to Don Trump.  And now, somewhere or the other, the US foreign policy advisors, many of his foreign policy experts in America itself, will ask Trump whether he has damaged the relations with India. Those relations were built in a way that Barack Obama, I would say, even George Bush and if you see, to some extent Joe Biden also contributed in some way or the other. Have you damaged that relationship so badly to such a level that now their Prime Minister does not want to come to the US even for a few hours?  And there is another interesting scene I want to show you. When PM Modi met Emmanuel Machara during the G7 summit, he jokingly said that these days I see that you are fighting even on Twitter.  I told you in the previous video how Trump called Emmanuel Machara an attention hungry person.  In response to that, Emmanuel Machara also replied to Trump. A very recent picture of the G7 has surfaced.  Where the US President and the French President are openly targeting each other on social media.  And PM Modi also jokingly highlighted this point here.  And the funny thing is that when Emmanuel Machoun himself posted the video of the highlights of the G7 summit on his Twitter account, he also added the clip of PM Modi in it. Here you will be able to see, now days you are fighting on Twitter, you are fighting on Twitter, so PM Modi also understands what status Donald Trump is roaming around with these days. You know every world leader is responding to him and reducing the stature of the US to a great extent, constantly and I don't know honestly, look, you know what Donald Trump's campaign was, how different he was saying, I do n't know what has happened to him, he has spoiled the relations of the US with almost the whole world, he had started targeting Elon Musk recently, then for some time now, it seems that both of them are continuing their friendship again and that too, don't know for how long it will continue, Trump's answer is very volatile nature and I feel that the way he is taking favours in these crypto companies of Pakistan, Trump will be trapped for a long time in the greed for money, such a rich man, such a billionaire man, even after reaching such a big position, his main concern is how will my companies grow, how will the money come, etc. and it is quite sad honestly now here I would like to ask you people, do you believe that did PM Modi do the right thing by rejecting Donald Trump's invite or not  Write your thought process in the comment section again. You can believe here that or not, maybe PM Modi should have gone there, your reason could be anything, but I would like to know here what the majority of you people think, since lakhs of people will watch this video, most likely around 10 lakh people watch the video, so I would like to know here what is your opinion, share your thoughts in the comment section.
