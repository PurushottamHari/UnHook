1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,119
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,520
Hello Friends.  Friends, do you know that there

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,920
was a time when Israel wanted to

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,239
help India so that Pakistan could

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,239
not acquire nuclear weapons.

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,559
Because if Pakistan had acquired nuclear weapons,

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,200
it would have become the first Islamic country to

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,559
possess nuclear weapons.

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,719
And here you can see the news

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,879
we are talking about is of 1979, 1983.  When Israel was

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,680
ready to help India declaratively denuclearize

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,600
Pakistan but the plan was called off.  But

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,359
somewhere India backed off, which I

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,359
will discuss with you in detail

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
in the video, but the first question that will come to your mind is

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,280
why are we discussing this today

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
?  As of today, we

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
all know that India, Pakistan

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
, Israel, North Korea and the

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,400
Permanent Five members all have

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
nuclear weapons.  But what has happened is that

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,000
today a big news has come from Iran.  It has been

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,560
claimed by Iran that if

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Israel in any way attacks Iran with nuclear weapons,

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,360
then in that case Pakistan will help

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
and Pakistan will also wage a nuclear war on

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,840
Israel and you

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,799
can see this has been said by senior Iranian

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,280
official Mohsen Rezai, who has been the former

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,680
commander of the Islamic Revolutionary

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,079
Guard Corps (IRGC) and currently he

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,759
is a member of the Iranian Expediency Council

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
and he gave a very bold

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,560
statement on Iranian television and

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
see what he said, Pakistan has

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
told us, Pakistan has told us that

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,439
if Israel uses nuclear weapons

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,079
against us, then in that case

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,880
Pakistan will retaliate against Israel with

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,280
nuclear weapons.  So this statement has

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,520
caused a stir all over the world.

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,520
Aldo, let me tell you that there is no

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,759
nuclear alliance of any kind between Iran and

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,920
Pakistan and this

56
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,920
shows that somewhere the entire war is

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,920
escalating from here.  Well,

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,080
Israel and Pakistan, if you look, as

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,400
I told you, are among the nine countries

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,360
that possess nuclear weapons

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,840
according to the ICN International Campaign

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,760
to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.  But here no

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
comment has been given by Pakistan

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,080
whether it will help or not.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
But yes, Pakistan has definitely said that in

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,800
this war that is going on,

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,160
Pakistan is completely standing behind it.  Meaning

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,000
Pakistan is completely with Iran.  And a

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
statement was also given from Pakistan

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,640
that all the Muslim countries should

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,200
support Iran.  And the way the

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,200
Abraham Accord etc. happened here.  The

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,360
way UAE has come into the Abraham Accord.

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,360
So they all should not do this.

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
All the Islamic countries should come together.

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Well, the question here is that

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
suppose in this case Pakistan retaliates, then does

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
Pakistan have the

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,879
capability to send its missile

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
to Israel?  Yes, let me

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,879
tell you, if you see Shaheen 3

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,319
of Pakistan, it is a medium range ballistic

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,640
missile whose range is 2750 km.  Its

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,640
payload is around 1000 kg and its

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,879
fuel is solid fuel.  And here,

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,440
if we do geographical calculations, then

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,560
if you look from Karachi, from Karachi

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,239
to Tel Aviv to Israel, the

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,480
distance comes to be around 2300 to 2600 km.

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,879
So this shows that Shaheen Three has the

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,200
capability.  Technically,

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
if Pakistan wants, it

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,040
can strike Israel using nuclear weapons

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,879
and why does this have strategic significance

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,120
?  Because Shaheen Three, originally, if you

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,440
see, was designed to

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
relativize India.  Because

98
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,760
if you look here at the land in India which is farthest from Pakistan,

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
you will find

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,480
Andaman Nicobar here.  So that the

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,480
missile can reach Andaman and Nicobar.

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,040
For this, Pakistan had

103
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,720
tried its best so that it could create a full spectrum deterrence

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,799
against India.  But

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,360
coincidentally what happens is that this

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
missile here can reach Israel as well

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,640
considering its range.

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,439
Now we come to what happened here

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,439
between 1979 and 1983.  Because

110
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,680
that's the way threats are being made here.

111
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,840
The way Iran has said that Pakistan will

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,400
stand with Iran.  Aldo, you might remember that there

113
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,160
was a time last year when Iran itself had

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
fired a missile here

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,639
in Balochistan, Pakistan.  And after that a war-like situation is

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,800
seen, whatever it is, here

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,440
you need to understand that you

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,320
all know that in 1971, when Pakistan had suffered a huge defeat,

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,479
Bangladesh had become a new country, so

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,800
after that, if you see, Zulfikar Ali

121
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,040
Bhutto was the President of Pakistan, at that

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
time, he accelerated the nuclear weapons

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,199
program here, and in

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,960
view of this, in fact,

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,680
I will show you near Islamabad, if you see,

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,400
this is Islamabad, Rawalpindi, this is the border,

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,960
India is on this side, Pakistan is near this,

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,680
if you see near Islamabad, the place is

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,680
Kahuta.  A uranium enrichment

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,639
plant was established there.  And

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,560
somewhere Israel feared that if

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,639
Pakistan gets hold of nuclear weapons, then

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
it will reach the Islamic world as well.  This

134
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,880
means that somewhere or the other Pakistan

135
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,360

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,360
can hand over these nuclear weapons to some other Muslim country, Iran or even to any other country.  So because of this there was

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,120
this fear somewhere.  Islamic Bomb was being

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,759
called as a way to say that

140
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,840
Pakistan should not get nuclear weapons.

141
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
At least Israel wanted this.

142
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,960
You all will remember what happens now.  Look,

143
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,039
till that time in 1971, there was

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,280
really no problem between Iran and Israel.

145
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,680
Because the Iran that you

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,440
see today, the Islamic

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,320
Republic of Islam, was basically formed after 1979.

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,280
So when the Islamic Republic was formed in 1979,

149
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,080
Iran became completely anti-Israel.  And at the

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,280
same time, Israel started to worry

151
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,680
that Israel or

152
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,600
whoever is there here, will create problems for it

153
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,520
and tomorrow if Iran gets

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,680
any nuclear weapons then it will

155
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,560
create problems.  Well, now you

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,600
see here, in 1979 itself, the then Prime Minister

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,759
of Israel, Benjamin Begin,

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,080
gave a warning to Margaret Thatcher, who was the

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,000
Prime Minister of Britain, in this regard.

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,160
He said that Pakistan's

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,479
nuclear ambition is

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,880
dangerous and apart from this, the

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,400
kind of ties it has with Libya, it is a dangerous thing for Israel

164
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,720
and all the partner countries of Israel.

165
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,800

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
We should stop this.  In fact,

167
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,440
a big operation took place here named

168
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,319
Operation Opera.  What was Operation Opera?

169
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,639
In June 1981, Israel launched a surprise air

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,520
strike inside Iraq.  The

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,360
Osirak reactor was built inside Iraq.  Due to which

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,199
Israel again feared that

173
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,199
attempts were being made to make nuclear weapons there.

174
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,440
So what has Israel done already?   He

175
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,120
attacked him and destroyed him.

176
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,919
And this destruction was done

177
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,880
by Israel using F16.

178
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,800
Bombs were dropped from the F16 fighter jet and the F15 was

179
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,479
escorting it.  Meaning he was protecting

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,039
F1 16.  So this was done in a swift and efficient

181
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,280
operation.  And

182
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,759
what did Israel do, inspired by that strike?

183
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
A full scale mockup was created in Kahuta.

184
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
Again, let me show you.  If

185
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,680
you look at the map of Israel, the entire

186
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,759
southern part at the bottom is the Nage Desert, as

187
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,599
you all might know.  And what does he do in this desert

188
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
?  Israel has built its entire military

189
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
installations etc.  If any

190
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,440
experiment etc. has to be done, it is done there.

191
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
So in this Negative Desert, it is

192
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,319
told that a full scale mockup

193
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,319
of Kahuta was made to show how

194
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,840
we can destroy Kahuta by carrying out an air strike on it.

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,919
And then here between 1979 and 1983,

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,800
Iran and Israel made an offer to India

197
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,759
and proposed that we can make a plan

198
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,560
under which we will carry out an

199
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,440
air strike on Pakistan so that

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Pakistan is not able to possess nuclear weapons.

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,919
And what plan was made for this?   The

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:01,520
plan was that the F6 F16

203
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,759
bomber, which is basically from Israel, will fly

204
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,400
from Jamnagar.  You are seeing this Jamnagar.

205
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,039
Israel's F16 will take off from here and will

206
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,360
first go to Udhampur.  It will go to Udhampur and

207
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,759
refuel and then

208
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,919
through the Himalayas, it will go to Kahuta, which

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,000
I told you about, near Islamabad and carry out an

210
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,240
air strike.  In fact,

211
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
it is also said that feasibility studies were also conducted by India.

212
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400

213
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,360
Training exercises were conducted to see

214
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,000
how our Jaguar aircraft

215
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,959
can help the F16 and whether we can attack Kahuta in the

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
same way as Iraq was attacked and

217
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,360

218
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,279
destroy Pakistan's ambition of nuclear weapons.

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
So all this planning was being told.

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
But it is obvious that India had to

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,519
consider other things as well.  For example,

223
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,080
if you see, it is told through sources

224
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,120
like Brigadier Firoz Hasan Khan and

225
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,720
analyst Bharat Kar Karnad, it has been

226
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,360
told that at that time Prime Minister Indira

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,480
Gandhi had in a

228
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,880
way approved this concept that India

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,040
will provide logistics, air

230
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,519
space and base to Israel so that the

231
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,000
Israeli jets can do this entire work.

232
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,160
But somewhere India

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,560
started getting hesitant because of multiple factors.  For

234
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,480
example, if we had struck here,

235
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,040
if there had been a strike from India's side, then

236
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
Pakistan could again start a big conventional war

237
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,959
against India.  So India might

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,839
not be wanting this.  Then there was

239
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,320
also the diplomatic cost.  India could also have faced international backlash.

240
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,880
Maybe some

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,880
surprise might happen.  What I mean to

242
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,120
say here is that India

243
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,440
wanted to carry out this strike, Israel wanted to carry out the same on

244
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,800
Kahuta.  So this should have been a surprise in a way.

245
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,880
But

246
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560
as time passed that surprise was also

247
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
ending.  Somewhere it seemed as if

248
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Pakistan was coming to know about this thing.  And

249
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,640
I will tell you how this is known.  The

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,279
pressure from the US was immense.

251
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,240
Reagan Ronald Reagan, who was in the US administration at that time,

252
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,959
issued a warning to

253
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,640
both India and Israel and said that

254
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,160
you will not strike Pakistan here.

255
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,240
So, in fact, it is also said

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,399
that Ronald Reagan had

257
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,880
also informed Pakistan that

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
such a strike could happen on you and keeping this in mind and

259
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640

260
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,720
considering the US diplomatic pressure, India

261
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,480
backed out from this plan and after that

262
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,720
ultimately Indira Gandhi ji was assassinated

263
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
in 1984 and after that when Rajiv

264
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
Gandhi ji came, he closed this entire

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,480
plan permanently.

266
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,399
So what is the consequence of this?   The

267
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,720
result was that what was a huge

268
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,959
opportunity vanished.  Pakistan

269
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
later conducts a nuclear test

270
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,640
in 1998.  You all know that

271
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,480
after nuclear testing, India becomes a nuclear power.  In

272
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,240
fact, if you see recently, the

273
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,560
Chief Ministers of Assam, Hemant and

274
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,640
Vishwa Sharma, have condemned it here

275
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,040
and said that it was a historic blunder.

276
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,200
India had a rare opportunity

277
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
to block Pakistan's nuclear path

278
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,839
forever.  India probably missed that.

279
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,480
And in fact, if you

280
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,560
see here, the retired Israeli General has

281
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
also said here that we are ready

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,600
to do your work.  We were ready to do it.

283
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,600
You shouldn't have backed off.  And India backed out

284
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,920
at the last minute and

285
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,920
because of this, there is a danger for both of them today.

286
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,079
For Israel and for India too.

287
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,480
Look, why does it matter overall?  It matters

288
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,000
because it shows the dilemma of

289
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,760

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,920
nuclear deterrence and geopolitical

291
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,160
balancing in a preemptive strike.  I mean, just

292
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,720
imagine how different history would have been if a strike had happened here.

293
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,839
The way

294
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,079
Pakistan keeps carrying out terrorist incidents in today's date.

295
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
Recently Operation Sindoor and before that the

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,120
attack on Pahalgam, perhaps these things would not have happened, I

297
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,440
mean a lot of ifs and buts

298
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,279
but the overall history would have been

299
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,120
seen very different

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,600
in South Asia.  So that's why I wanted to tell you

301
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
how you

302
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
can link the history.  The present

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
things that are going on right now.  So I hope you have understood

304
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,320
and before leaving I have a very

305
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,720
interesting question, can you tell me

306
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,120
which of these nuclear power countries have

307
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959

308
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
declared the policy of no first use and you all know the right answer to this.  You

309
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,760

310
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
will find it on my Instagram.  If you are not there, no

311
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,200
problem, you can get the

312
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,800
correct answer from telegram.  And friends, as you all

313
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,399
know Pratigya of Study IQ is the

314
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,079
foundation batch.  This is a batch in which

315
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,079
complete preparation is done for the prelims mains interview.

316
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,839
All you have to do is use the code

317
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,600
Ankit LIVE to get maximum discount.

318
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,600
You will find its link in the comment section.

319
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,560
Every single book pitch has topper

320
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,880
suggested but nothing works for me.  I was

321
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,720
like it wouldn't happen.  I leave it.  If it is not

322
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,760
happening then what is the use?  By reading them again and again.

323
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,000

324
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,639
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

325
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,800
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

326
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,320
IQ supported me till Mains.

327
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,320
Even after that he did not

328
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,959
leave me.  I have taken this mock I study

329
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,880
IQ and I would recommend study IQ.

330
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,120
Yes I will definitely recommend

331
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,120
Study IQ.
