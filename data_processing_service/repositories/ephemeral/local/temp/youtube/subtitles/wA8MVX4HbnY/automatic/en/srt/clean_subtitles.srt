Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then what is the use of reading them again and again? I would like to thank Study IQ.  I Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study IQ supported me till Mains. Even after that he did not leave me. And I have taken this mock I study IQ. And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, do you know that there was a time when Israel wanted to help India so that Pakistan could not acquire nuclear weapons. Because if Pakistan had acquired nuclear weapons, it would have become the first Islamic country to possess nuclear weapons. And here you can see the news we are talking about is of 1979, 1983.  When Israel was ready to help India declaratively denuclearize Pakistan but the plan was called off.  But somewhere India backed off, which I will discuss with you in detail in the video, but the first question that will come to your mind is why are we discussing this today ?  As of today, we all know that India, Pakistan , Israel, North Korea and the Permanent Five members all have nuclear weapons.  But what has happened is that today a big news has come from Iran.  It has been claimed by Iran that if Israel in any way attacks Iran with nuclear weapons, then in that case Pakistan will help and Pakistan will also wage a nuclear war on Israel and you can see this has been said by senior Iranian official Mohsen Rezai, who has been the former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and currently he is a member of the Iranian Expediency Council and he gave a very bold statement on Iranian television and see what he said, Pakistan has told us, Pakistan has told us that if Israel uses nuclear weapons against us, then in that case Pakistan will retaliate against Israel with nuclear weapons.  So this statement has caused a stir all over the world. Aldo, let me tell you that there is no nuclear alliance of any kind between Iran and Pakistan and this shows that somewhere the entire war is escalating from here.  Well, Israel and Pakistan, if you look, as I told you, are among the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons according to the ICN International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.  But here no comment has been given by Pakistan whether it will help or not. But yes, Pakistan has definitely said that in this war that is going on, Pakistan is completely standing behind it.  Meaning Pakistan is completely with Iran.  And a statement was also given from Pakistan that all the Muslim countries should support Iran.  And the way the Abraham Accord etc. happened here.  The way UAE has come into the Abraham Accord. So they all should not do this. All the Islamic countries should come together. Well, the question here is that suppose in this case Pakistan retaliates, then does Pakistan have the capability to send its missile to Israel?  Yes, let me tell you, if you see Shaheen 3 of Pakistan, it is a medium range ballistic missile whose range is 2750 km.  Its payload is around 1000 kg and its fuel is solid fuel.  And here, if we do geographical calculations, then if you look from Karachi, from Karachi to Tel Aviv to Israel, the distance comes to be around 2300 to 2600 km. So this shows that Shaheen Three has the capability.  Technically, if Pakistan wants, it can strike Israel using nuclear weapons and why does this have strategic significance ?  Because Shaheen Three, originally, if you see, was designed to relativize India.  Because if you look here at the land in India which is farthest from Pakistan, you will find Andaman Nicobar here.  So that the missile can reach Andaman and Nicobar. For this, Pakistan had tried its best so that it could create a full spectrum deterrence against India.  But coincidentally what happens is that this missile here can reach Israel as well considering its range. Now we come to what happened here between 1979 and 1983.  Because that's the way threats are being made here. The way Iran has said that Pakistan will stand with Iran.  Aldo, you might remember that there was a time last year when Iran itself had fired a missile here in Balochistan, Pakistan.  And after that a war-like situation is seen, whatever it is, here you need to understand that you all know that in 1971, when Pakistan had suffered a huge defeat, Bangladesh had become a new country, so after that, if you see, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was the President of Pakistan, at that time, he accelerated the nuclear weapons program here, and in view of this, in fact, I will show you near Islamabad, if you see, this is Islamabad, Rawalpindi, this is the border, India is on this side, Pakistan is near this, if you see near Islamabad, the place is Kahuta.  A uranium enrichment plant was established there.  And somewhere Israel feared that if Pakistan gets hold of nuclear weapons, then it will reach the Islamic world as well.  This means that somewhere or the other Pakistan can hand over these nuclear weapons to some other Muslim country, Iran or even to any other country.  So because of this there was this fear somewhere.  Islamic Bomb was being called as a way to say that Pakistan should not get nuclear weapons. At least Israel wanted this. You all will remember what happens now.  Look, till that time in 1971, there was really no problem between Iran and Israel. Because the Iran that you see today, the Islamic Republic of Islam, was basically formed after 1979. So when the Islamic Republic was formed in 1979, Iran became completely anti-Israel.  And at the same time, Israel started to worry that Israel or whoever is there here, will create problems for it and tomorrow if Iran gets any nuclear weapons then it will create problems.  Well, now you see here, in 1979 itself, the then Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Begin, gave a warning to Margaret Thatcher, who was the Prime Minister of Britain, in this regard. He said that Pakistan's nuclear ambition is dangerous and apart from this, the kind of ties it has with Libya, it is a dangerous thing for Israel and all the partner countries of Israel. We should stop this.  In fact, a big operation took place here named Operation Opera.  What was Operation Opera? In June 1981, Israel launched a surprise air strike inside Iraq.  The Osirak reactor was built inside Iraq.  Due to which Israel again feared that attempts were being made to make nuclear weapons there. So what has Israel done already?   He attacked him and destroyed him. And this destruction was done by Israel using F16. Bombs were dropped from the F16 fighter jet and the F15 was escorting it.  Meaning he was protecting F1 16.  So this was done in a swift and efficient operation.  And what did Israel do, inspired by that strike? A full scale mockup was created in Kahuta. Again, let me show you.  If you look at the map of Israel, the entire southern part at the bottom is the Nage Desert, as you all might know.  And what does he do in this desert ?  Israel has built its entire military installations etc.  If any experiment etc. has to be done, it is done there. So in this Negative Desert, it is told that a full scale mockup of Kahuta was made to show how we can destroy Kahuta by carrying out an air strike on it. And then here between 1979 and 1983, Iran and Israel made an offer to India and proposed that we can make a plan under which we will carry out an air strike on Pakistan so that Pakistan is not able to possess nuclear weapons. And what plan was made for this?   The plan was that the F6 F16 bomber, which is basically from Israel, will fly from Jamnagar.  You are seeing this Jamnagar. Israel's F16 will take off from here and will first go to Udhampur.  It will go to Udhampur and refuel and then through the Himalayas, it will go to Kahuta, which I told you about, near Islamabad and carry out an air strike.  In fact, it is also said that feasibility studies were also conducted by India. Training exercises were conducted to see how our Jaguar aircraft can help the F16 and whether we can attack Kahuta in the same way as Iraq was attacked and destroy Pakistan's ambition of nuclear weapons. So all this planning was being told. But it is obvious that India had to consider other things as well.  For example, if you see, it is told through sources like Brigadier Firoz Hasan Khan and analyst Bharat Kar Karnad, it has been told that at that time Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had in a way approved this concept that India will provide logistics, air space and base to Israel so that the Israeli jets can do this entire work. But somewhere India started getting hesitant because of multiple factors.  For example, if we had struck here, if there had been a strike from India's side, then Pakistan could again start a big conventional war against India.  So India might not be wanting this.  Then there was also the diplomatic cost.  India could also have faced international backlash. Maybe some surprise might happen.  What I mean to say here is that India wanted to carry out this strike, Israel wanted to carry out the same on Kahuta.  So this should have been a surprise in a way. But as time passed that surprise was also ending.  Somewhere it seemed as if Pakistan was coming to know about this thing.  And I will tell you how this is known.  The pressure from the US was immense. Reagan Ronald Reagan, who was in the US administration at that time, issued a warning to both India and Israel and said that you will not strike Pakistan here. So, in fact, it is also said that Ronald Reagan had also informed Pakistan that such a strike could happen on you and keeping this in mind and considering the US diplomatic pressure, India backed out from this plan and after that ultimately Indira Gandhi ji was assassinated in 1984 and after that when Rajiv Gandhi ji came, he closed this entire plan permanently. So what is the consequence of this?   The result was that what was a huge opportunity vanished.  Pakistan later conducts a nuclear test in 1998.  You all know that after nuclear testing, India becomes a nuclear power.  In fact, if you see recently, the Chief Ministers of Assam, Hemant and Vishwa Sharma, have condemned it here and said that it was a historic blunder. India had a rare opportunity to block Pakistan's nuclear path forever.  India probably missed that. And in fact, if you see here, the retired Israeli General has also said here that we are ready to do your work.  We were ready to do it. You shouldn't have backed off.  And India backed out at the last minute and because of this, there is a danger for both of them today. For Israel and for India too. Look, why does it matter overall?  It matters because it shows the dilemma of nuclear deterrence and geopolitical balancing in a preemptive strike.  I mean, just imagine how different history would have been if a strike had happened here. The way Pakistan keeps carrying out terrorist incidents in today's date. Recently Operation Sindoor and before that the attack on Pahalgam, perhaps these things would not have happened, I mean a lot of ifs and buts but the overall history would have been seen very different in South Asia.  So that's why I wanted to tell you how you can link the history.  The present things that are going on right now.  So I hope you have understood and before leaving I have a very interesting question, can you tell me which of these nuclear power countries have declared the policy of no first use and you all know the right answer to this.  You will find it on my Instagram.  If you are not there, no problem, you can get the correct answer from telegram.  And friends, as you all know Pratigya of Study IQ is the foundation batch.
