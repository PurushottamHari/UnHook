00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,960
welcome

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,519
to hard talk i'm stephen sacker my guest

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
today

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,280
is a great british actress whose body of

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,640
work represents

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,400
a paradox in the public mind dame diana

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
rigg will forever be linked with

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,560
performances which were

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
almost a sideshow in her long career i'm

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,960
thinking of her role in

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,720
the avengers and as a bond girl both

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
attracted huge attention

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,559
but it's in the theater that she's won

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,200
critical acclaim

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,040
and a host of awards now she has an

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,079
iconic role in the hit series

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
game of thrones so how's it been dealing

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,680
with the

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:58,690
fickleness and unpredictability of an

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:01:12,240
acting life

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:14,799
[Music]

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
dame diana rigg welcome to hardtop thank

24
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,439
you

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,119
i want to ask you a pretty basic first

26
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,600
question is your approach

27
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,360
to acting today pretty similar to the

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,360
way it's always been or

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,759
has it changed pretty radically over the

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,240
years i think it's it's more or less the

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
same

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,920
i i did ask a friend of mine who's known

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,000
me for 50 years

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
because i'm surrounded by when you know

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
when you're working with younger people

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,320
the waves of ambition come across

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,439
to you and i asked this friend of mine

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,159
was i ambitious

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,079
and he said no you were always grateful

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,119
and i think that just about sums up

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,680
um my career i suppose the difference is

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,520
that

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
having done so much over such a long

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,840
period you

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,719
i'm imagining feel much more

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
confident about who you are and where

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,840
you're going and what you've already

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,320
achieved and i just wonder if that makes

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,880
a difference

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
yes it does of course it does i mean

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,640
i've

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,920
i've always loved working i don't

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,959
live to work i've always had a life

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,480
beside

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
my work so that it i've had a balanced

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,280
life because i

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,959
do look back now at my age you tend to

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,400
um and i've always had

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,640
a pretty full personal life as well as

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,560
thank goodness i've been so lucky with

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,480
my professional life

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
well already i'm getting a feeling that

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
you love what you do i guess you must

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
do it because you love it now because

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,239
you know when you started you had to put

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,000
bread on the table you know that was

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,360
your job and now you do it i guess

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
simply because you choose to because

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
it's fun

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,959
yes but also um

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,120
i i simply don't understand people

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,599
who who um decry what they do

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,760
actors you know talk about where we're

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,560
children really at heart or we're

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
half formed or we're really living out

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,720
fantasies on the stage

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,120
and it's it it's it's very belittling to

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,680
a profession which actually goes back to

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,000
640 bc um

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
i mean one of the tropes is that actors

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
are people

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
uh sort of deeply insecure and in search

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
of an identity because that's why

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
they're drawn to a job where

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,040
they can play other people all the time

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,599
inhabit other people i take exception to

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,599
that

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,720
i mean not great exception i just think

89
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,440
they're foolish when they

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
speak like that because i think if if if

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,200
you do

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,280
justice to the acting

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,799
you have to you you have to have a

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
profound knowledge

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,360
of of the human condition um

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
and and of yourself because what happens

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,159
when you

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
accept a part is you have to measure the

99
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,120
distance between yourself

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,879
and that part and you have to fill it

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
fill it with truth i mean sarah sidon

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,239
said i look upon a part to see if it is

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,840
in nature and if it is then i know it

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,200
can be played

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,040
so you have to turn that written page

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,799
into nature so on that basis are there

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,599
many parts that you've turned down

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
because you just didn't believe in them

109
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,400
no

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
i feel like generally i've generally

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,160
thought oh if i don't believe

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
in this it's a bit of a challenge really

113
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,199
i've got i've got to

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,240
i've got to uh make it believable

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,880
and actually talking about belief

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,600
um it's one of the most moving things

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
about

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
uh again our profession being in the

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,520
theater is that

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,880
people come to believe they lend you

121
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,840
their belief

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,639
they don't come cynically they want to

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,840
believe

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,880
and this is a great great uh

125
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,080
gift that they give us you've talked

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,160
about the theater and we'll talk a lot

127
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,919
more about the theater but i i i

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
want to in a sense start in the here and

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,479
now and then weave backward through your

130
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,360
career

131
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,080
the here and now to many people is all

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,880
about

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,520
a role you have found in one of the

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,479
biggest

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,440
tv series of our age that is game of

136
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,080
thrones

137
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,080
now it's full of young sort of starlet

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
actors but it also has a rather

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,880
wonderful part for you

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,960
how um how did it feel getting involved

141
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
in something that's become such a a

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,720
current cult

143
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,320
i i wasn't aware that i was getting

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
involved in something so huge

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,639
i really had no idea um as ever i was

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
deeply

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
grateful to get the part and i and to

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,680
a lady is it a lena tyrell

well watch a little clip let's let's

158
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,919

165
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,039
diplomacy

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:24,319
shut up dear anything from you

167
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,319
no good let the grown women speak

168
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,880
the lannisters it's a fantastic little

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,160
clip because it gives a real sense of

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,479
your strength and

171
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,360
meanness yeah but it's also down to the

172
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,039
script writers

173
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
i mean thank you to them for a good

174
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,520
scene yeah well it's interesting because

175
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,600
uh you know i've on hard talk

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,919
interviewed quite a number of actors

177
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
female actors over the years who've

178
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,800
bemoaned the dearth

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,599
of great parts for women as as they get

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,919
older and progress

181
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,759
through careers have you experienced

182
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,560
that or is that not your experience i

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,680
i've

184
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,960
truly been lucky i really have

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,080
and i think um in a sense i

186
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,560
sort of uh developed and

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,000
and and become a better actress as i've

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,440
grown older

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,360
do you think it's because some actors

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
female actors are too picky i mean

191
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
you know because it is it's again it's

192
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,520
become something of a cliche almost and

193
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,759
i

194
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,039
quote you one brilliant actor kristen

195
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
scott thomas

196
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,400
who says you know i know all the stories

197
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,880
of older women not getting

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,120
jobs in film can be so very boring but

199
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,039
it is true it's a disaster

200
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,880
well i think i think she's talking about

201
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,840
film uh is that different

202
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,919
i think it is different and and i can't

203
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,039
comment because my film career is

204
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,680
pretty well negligible i've done the odd

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
film but

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,400
i'm not famous for film my film work

207
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,919
well we'll get to film work because

208
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,639
there is one particular role you played

209
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,639
which

210
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,240
has gone down in history because it was

211
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
a bond movie and everybody remembers

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,919
bond movies but

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,440
i don't want to get there just yet i i

214
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,560
want to stick with

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
in a sense the way in which game of

216
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,039
thrones

217
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,199
mirrors something you did early in your

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,639
career which was another cult

219
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,280
tv series and that is the avengers

220
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
very different eras different styles but

221
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,599
there's something

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,160
actually quite similar about the way

223
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,840
both

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,280
captured the spirit of an age would you

225
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,560
agree yes

226
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,360
i think so i mean she emma peale i do

227
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
hate the name

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,440
oh talk about cliche but anyway

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
emma peale was way ahead of her time and

230
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,320
the reason for that

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,519
was that um originally it was two

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,399
fellows

233
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,560
it was um patrick mcnee and another

234
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,279
actor whose name escapes me

235
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,880
and he dropped out and on a blackman

236
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
took over and they didn't change the

237
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,839
script

238
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
so it was a part written for a man that

239
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,320
ended up being played by a woman and

240
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
maybe that's why so many people have

241
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
said my god this was revolutionary it

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,959
was a really

243
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,440
proper strong independent equal part for

244
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
a woman

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
that's right and that's because that

246
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
actually wasn't supposed to be for a

247
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
woman exactly that's how it happened

248
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,360
yeah and you took over from honor

249
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
blackman you were very young i mean you

250
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,959
sort of paid your dues

251
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,560
in theater provincial theater the rsc as

252
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,839
well doing shakespeare and then suddenly

253
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
you were plucked out of all that and

254
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,920
told

255
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,399
you you were going to have this really

256
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,080
rather glamorous part in a in a new

257
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,080
tv show i left um i was with the royal

258
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,080
shakespeare company for five years and i

259
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,440
would sort of work my way up

260
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,279
and uh to play leads and um

261
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,399
and i i left uh because i

262
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
sensed i had to broaden myself i didn't

263
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,080
want

264
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,200
just to be a shakespearean actress and

265
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,959
the world of television was there

266
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,839
sort of beckoning in a way and i was

267
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
incredibly lucky to get an audition and

268
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,600
and

269
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
and to get the part well for those on

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
the planet who don't remember the

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,040
avengers

272
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
and that sort of 60s sort of style that

273
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,640
it encapsulated

274
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,920
let's have a look at a clip of m appeal

275
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,880
supersleuth

276
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,240
in the avengers and in a very particular

277
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
uh

278
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
getter let's have a look

279
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:16,800
give me the gun back up

280
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:19,620
[Music]

281
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:26,509
give me the gun

282
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:26,509
[Music]

283
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,820
[Applause]

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
that's sweet it's compelling stuff i

285
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,760
mean

286
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
obviously i'm not going to mess with you

287
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,600
in the studio given what i've just seen

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,120
but um how do you feel about watching

289
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
that now because if anybody mentions

290
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,839
your name i think the first images

291
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
conjured up

292
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,360
are of the catsuit and of em appeal and

293
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
uh

294
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
do you like that or is that actually

295
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,800
quite frustrating no i

296
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,040
i'm i'm again i'm very grateful

297
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,320
the only frustrating part about it was

298
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,399
the suit was

299
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
oh god it was uncomfortable and it took

300
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
me a good half hour to go to the lava

301
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
trick

302
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
getting out of that thing you know

303
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,560
peeling it off

304
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,040
um but it i'm very grateful to it and

305
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,480
really

306
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,600
it it it suddenly projected me

307
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,240
in beyond

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
years of work in the theater yeah i mean

309
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,519
that that

310
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,279
is frustrating in a way for somebody who

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,680
loves theater so much

312
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,519
that you know you can cut through and

313
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,920
reach a massive audience

314
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
with a only two years as it was yes on

315
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
that show in a way that

316
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
years and years and years of classical

317
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,959
theater

318
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,720
yeah and um i went back um

319
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399
i think it was after the second year i

320
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,680
went back to stratford

321
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,279
to do 12th night to say look hey i can

322
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,320
put bums on seats

323
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,959
and in fact i was doing the two um

324
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,079
together i was filming the avengers and

325
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,079
doing 12 tonight

326
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,000
just one thing about that that intrigues

327
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,279
me because they've been all sorts of

328
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,399
different analyses

329
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,279
uh of what m appeal represented and a

330
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,200
lot of it is

331
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,440
seen through a sort of feminist prism

332
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
some feminists say she was fantastic she

333
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
was revolutionary because

334
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
she was a strong independent

335
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
phenomenally capable woman who was an

336
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,279
equal partner with a man

337
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
and others have said oh yeah but how

338
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,760
terrible that this sort of independent

339
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,920
woman had to be put in high heels and a

340
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
cat suit and looked so very glam you

341
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,079
know

342
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,839
men didn't have to go through all that

343
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,480
do they want hairy legs i mean

344
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,680
you know you can't of course it was if

345
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
you're playing the lead on

346
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,399
on in a television series um

347
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,800
and and in that sort of series uh why

348
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,600
not present glamour at the same time as

349
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,639
uh self-sufficiency i don't i don't see

350
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,320
any problem with that

351
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,519
as a very successful actor in your

352
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,120
20s 30s getting more and more successful

353
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,560
would you would you say you

354
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,560
had feminist instincts um i've always

355
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,160
had feminist instincts where

356
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,560
parity of of

357
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,760
salary is concerned i mean i think an

358
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,639
awful lot of it is

359
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,639
um still a huge issue today it is a huge

360
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,880
in hollywood there are campaigns of

361
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,920
women actors where we've watched um the

362
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,399
tennis players

363
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,320
fight their fight um actresses are

364
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,240
constantly fighting in in

365
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,839
uh america about it i mean catherine

366
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
hepburn uh

367
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,000
kicked it all off many many years ago

368
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,200
and it's absolutely ridiculous chasm

369
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,880
between men and women

370
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,240
sure is it true that you discovered on

371
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,040
the set of the avengers that

372
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
the male cameramen were earning more

373
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,519
than you

374
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,160
yes and then when i um complained

375
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,160
and it hit the newspapers i was dubbed

376
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,160
incredibly mercenary and

377
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,519
in those days i wouldn't be now you were

378
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,720
friends with patrick my knee who was

379
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
your co-star

380
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,240
was he being paid much more than you i

381
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,240
never asked him

382
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
we never got there i didn't want to put

383
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
him in that situation

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
i was it was my fight and i had to fight

385
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,639
it by myself

386
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,480
here's another thing that i'm interested

387
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,720
in looking back is wonderful looking at

388
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
the old footage

389
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
we talked about game of thrones and

390
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,639
today's young acting stars in games game

391
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,079
of thrones

392
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,639
are plunged into a world of celebrity

393
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,000
uh and they become magazine fodder and

394
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,920
everything else

395
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,440
it was a different era in in the mid

396
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,320
late 60s when you were doing

397
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
the avengers i wonder if there was an

398
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,639
element of that for you

399
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,160
and how you felt about the celebrity

400
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,399
culture that may have come your way

401
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,440
i i was completely unprepared for it

402
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,560
completely

403
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
um i think nowadays the young are

404
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,320
prepared for it because

405
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,480
they see it all around them they read it

406
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,240
in the magazines and everything

407
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,000
i i know i i was naive very naive

408
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,839
and no idea and the the fan mail was

409
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,680
flooding in i didn't have a secretary um

410
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,519
it mounted up i put it all in the back

411
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
of my mini and drove around with it

412
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,760
feeling

413
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,199
so guilty did you like it no i felt me

414
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,240
guilty because i

415
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,079
first of all i didn't have the

416
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,720
photographs to send back which is what

417
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,279
they're all

418
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,959
wanting i didn't know how to set about

419
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,760
dealing with fan mail at

420
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,199
all and it took me a good long time to

421
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,440
to work it all out

422
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,360
i think people get help now in in the

423
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
sense that maybe the studios help them

424
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,079
or

425
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,320
somebody helps them but i just have my

426
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,920
mother yeah you've also said i i like

427
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
this comment you said you

428
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,600
when you're acting with the game of

429
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
thrones cast you sometimes look at them

430
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,199
and you think

431
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,880
darling hearts of the young ones darling

432
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
hearts you have no idea what the rest of

433
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,480
your life is going to be like unless you

434
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,480
put in a proper apprenticeship

435
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,000
and if i sound like an old bag banging

436
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
on like this then that's what i

437
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
am yeah it's true do you feel that

438
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,040
today's generation of

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,639
successful young actors aren't really

440
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,639
sort of putting in the world they're

441
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,959
suddenly catapulted

442
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:05,920
into um this this world of series

443
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,360
and it is one world but it isn't the

444
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,079
only world

445
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,560
and um i i think you know that

446
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,800
what i've always believed is the stage

447
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,320
gives you longevity

448
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,480
i think um film the more a film will

449
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,480
spit you out at a certain age the more

450
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
of television will spit you out at a

451
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,440
certain age

452
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,720
but theater never does that

453
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,639
and they really need

454
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,519
to step on stage and discover what their

455
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,880
true worth

456
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,240
is through the audience

457
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,480
yeah fascinating talking of film

458
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
you say film can spit you out as an

459
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,680
actor so easily but

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,199
there are certain roles that live long

461
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,240
in the memory and i think you

462
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,680
can lay claim to one of them uh

463
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
with your role in one of the bond movies

464
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,399
yes

465
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,680
on her majesty's secret service which is

466
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
remembered i suppose partly because it

467
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,959
was the only

468
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,559
bond role played by george lazenby but

469
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,520
also because your female

470
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,959
character the love interest was actually

471
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,439
quite different from most

472
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,280
bond girls it was a deeper character a

473
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,360
more human character and actually

474
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,880
ended up with a marriage between your

475
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,640
character and

476
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,959
bond himself let's just see how you

477
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,959
played the role alongside bond

478
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,080
no sign of them yet or of someone saying

479
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,559
thank you

480
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,960
thank you tracy you've got sharp eyes

481
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,200
and beautiful

482
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,160
earlobes what were you doing so near bis

483
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,480
gloria

484
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,480
now i have a new interest in life with

485
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
the sports egg very wholesome just one

486
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,000
winter sportsman

487
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,000
and bar told me where to find him

488
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,480
[Applause]

489
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,480
just keep my mind on your driving

490
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,720
there you are tracy de vincenzo i

491
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,720
believe your character was called

492
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,960
was that fun because a lot of women

493
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,400
who've played in bond as

494
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,200
quote unquote bond girls get pigeonholed

495
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,240
and i wonder whether you felt you did or

496
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,120
whether you escaped that

497
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,679
no no no not at all really not i mean i

498
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,160
think uh yeah no not

499
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,679
i can't afterwards say it was quite

500
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,799
difficult playing alongside

501
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,480
george george was difficult and

502
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,360
there's no mistake about it um

503
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
and as a result he was not invited back

504
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,960
um

505
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,799
but nonetheless i really wasn't up to it

506
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,000
no he was perfectly good he really

507
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,400
really was

508
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,840
i i think i mean i haven't seen it for

509
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,200
ages apart from that cut

510
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,280
um i thought he was yes he was good

511
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
um but he was just so difficult off and

512
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,600
demanding and um

513
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
and the producers thought enough you

514
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,039
know uh

515
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
film folklore has it that because your

516
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,320
relationship with him was

517
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,440
quite difficult you you ate garlic

518
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,919
before the yeah

519
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,799
that was that was so silly he accused me

520
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,320
of that and

521
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,240
in fact he actually accused you of yeah

522
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,280
he did and in fact

523
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,160
what happened was that i'd had uh

524
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,600
mistakenly i'd had uh pate chicken liver

525
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,559
patty for lunch

526
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,240
and they'd put garlic in it but i didn't

527
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,240
i didn't mean to

528
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,160
and i'm absolutely certain that prior to

529
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,200
the um

530
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,280
the snogging scene i'd i'd actually

531
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,520
done everything that actors do clean

532
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,880
your teeth and chew gum and spray and

533
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,039
all that kind of stuff

534
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,640
but he thought because he was paranoid

535
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,679
by this time he thought i'd done it on

536
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,520
purpose

537
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,440
which i hadn't i wouldn't dream of doing

538
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,240
so i'm so glad we've cleared that up

539
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,919
well i'm glad

540
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,400
too because it's lingered for 25 years

541
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,720
let me ask you about confidence and

542
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,559
security stroke insecurity in the acting

543
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,559
profession you you

544
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,919
have said over the years that you look

545
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,679
back on on

546
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,840
the roles you played and the the life

547
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,000
you led as a younger actor and

548
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,880
and you wished you'd been more confident

549
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,080
and

550
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,039
happier in your own skin yes um

551
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,960
you actually it it uh lack of confidence

552
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,400
is a form of self-torture

553
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,280
it's ridiculous and i forget who it was

554
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,240
either

555
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,280
olivier if somebody said it's it's uh

556
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
you're you're

557
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,600
you're being selfish when you're worried

558
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,720
and and worrying about yourself you know

559
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,840
um because

560
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,120
acting is is giving out

561
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,200
and being um unconfident is

562
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,640
sort of hunging yourself and a bit

563
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,240
inward looking

564
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,000
um and i'd sort of think i wasted time

565
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,799
not having enough confidence and is that

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,960
because you had a wonderful period

567
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,360
i guess in the 1990s when you won a host

568
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,760
of awards for a really huge part

569
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,679
that was just such a glorious time i

570
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,000
mean thanks to the director jonathan

571
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,679
kent with whom i worked

572
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,440
one after the other you know medea

573
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,240
federer um hippolytus uh mother courage

574
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,720
it was he who put me up there and he who

575
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,080
showed

576
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,120
faith in me uh and i have

577
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,679
nothing but gratitude for that period of

578
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,280
my life because it really was

579
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:25,360
wonderful and i i was very very lucky

580
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,480
not many actresses get the opportunity

581
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,039
to play these parts one after the other

582
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,559
i mean how lucky was that well i don't

583
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,320
think it's luck is it it's talent but

584
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,080
also a great thing that you seem to have

585
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,640
done is you seem to have

586
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,200
come to a clear understanding that that

587
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,880
you know

588
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,320
theater has its ups and downs and that

589
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,640
you can get bad reviews

590
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,480
and in the end it's better to sort of

591
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,480
shrug your shoulders or laugh at them

592
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,559
than get deeply wounded by them yeah

593
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,880
you've got to you've got to move on

594
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,159
just move on have you had lousy reviews

595
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,240
that stick in your mind

596
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,360
well uh the worst one um was when i did

597
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,039
um on broadway avalon eloise and

598
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,600
we did a nude scene uh keith michelle

599
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,760
and i

600
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,760
um we had sort of uh what do you mean

601
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,280
nothing knickers off and

602
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,679
deeply uncomfortable and absolutely

603
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,679
horrible and cold

604
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,600
and there was a um what was he always

605
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,600
called john simon he was small rather

606
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,840
ugly hungarian gentleman

607
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,240
who said i uh diana rigg is built like a

608
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,720
brick mausoleum with insufficient flying

609
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,480
buttresses

610
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,480
we'll try and get over that i can

611
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,640
imagine you would remember that

612
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
how to how to play the nude scene

613
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,400
afterwards i mean just

614
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,280
horrible but what's beautiful is you

615
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,360
you've

616
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,799
you've found the humor in it and also

617
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,000
you've now turned it into a stage

618
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,440
you know you've collected all these

619
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
horrible reviews not just of yourself

620
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,919
but many many other great actors as well

621
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
and you you've

622
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,200
got this book which has one of the best

623
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,640
titles ever of

624
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,640
no turn unstoned i mean it's become

625
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
quite a thing in itself isn't it yes it

626
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,960
has yeah

627
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,640
um the point about bad notices

628
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,240
is that you have to be able to they've

629
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,960
got to be funny for a kickoff

630
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,880
and mine is uh but also to be able to

631
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,280
quote them is is cathartic

632
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
it sort of halves the pain to get a

633
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,400
laugh at the end of it

634
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,760
do you think some actors are too serious

635
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,240
about this just a bit

636
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,440
trade of theirs just a bit yeah about

637
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,000
themselves as well

638
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,960
i mean there's a lot of laughter in in

639
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,799
this profession

640
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:34,400
a lot and um i think

641
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,200
yes to be too serious

642
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,400
is a grave mistake we're almost out of

643
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,000
time i don't think anybody around the

644
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
world would forgive me unless you tell

645
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,159
