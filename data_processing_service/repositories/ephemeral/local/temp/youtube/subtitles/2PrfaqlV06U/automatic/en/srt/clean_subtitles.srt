[Music] welcome to hard talk i'm stephen sacker my guest today is a great british actress whose body of work represents a paradox in the public mind dame diana rigg will forever be linked with performances which were almost a sideshow in her long career i'm thinking of her role in the avengers and as a bond girl both attracted huge attention but it's in the theater that she's won critical acclaim and a host of awards now she has an iconic role in the hit series game of thrones so how's it been dealing with the fickleness and unpredictability of an acting life [Music] dame diana rigg welcome to hardtop thank you i want to ask you a pretty basic first question is your approach to acting today pretty similar to the way it's always been or has it changed pretty radically over the years i think it's it's more or less the same i i did ask a friend of mine who's known me for 50 years because i'm surrounded by when you know when you're working with younger people the waves of ambition come across to you and i asked this friend of mine was i ambitious and he said no you were always grateful and i think that just about sums up um my career i suppose the difference is that having done so much over such a long period you i'm imagining feel much more confident about who you are and where you're going and what you've already achieved and i just wonder if that makes a difference yes it does of course it does i mean i've i've always loved working i don't live to work i've always had a life beside my work so that it i've had a balanced life because i do look back now at my age you tend to um and i've always had a pretty full personal life as well as thank goodness i've been so lucky with my professional life well already i'm getting a feeling that you love what you do i guess you must do it because you love it now because you know when you started you had to put bread on the table you know that was your job and now you do it i guess simply because you choose to because it's fun yes but also um i i simply don't understand people who who um decry what they do actors you know talk about where we're children really at heart or we're half formed or we're really living out fantasies on the stage and it's it it's it's very belittling to a profession which actually goes back to 640 bc um i mean one of the tropes is that actors are people uh sort of deeply insecure and in search of an identity because that's why they're drawn to a job where they can play other people all the time inhabit other people i take exception to that i mean not great exception i just think they're foolish when they speak like that because i think if if if you do justice to the acting you have to you you have to have a profound knowledge of of the human condition um and and of yourself because what happens when you accept a part is you have to measure the distance between yourself and that part and you have to fill it fill it with truth i mean sarah sidon said i look upon a part to see if it is in nature and if it is then i know it can be played so you have to turn that written page into nature so on that basis are there many parts that you've turned down because you just didn't believe in them no i feel like generally i've generally thought oh if i don't believe in this it's a bit of a challenge really i've got i've got to i've got to uh make it believable and actually talking about belief um it's one of the most moving things about uh again our profession being in the theater is that people come to believe they lend you their belief they don't come cynically they want to believe and this is a great great uh gift that they give us you've talked about the theater and we'll talk a lot more about the theater but i i i want to in a sense start in the here and now and then weave backward through your career the here and now to many people is all about a role you have found in one of the biggest tv series of our age that is game of thrones now it's full of young sort of starlet actors but it also has a rather wonderful part for you how um how did it feel getting involved in something that's become such a a current cult i i wasn't aware that i was getting involved in something so huge i really had no idea um as ever i was deeply grateful to get the part and i and to get such a good part too i really enjoy doing it i mean is she your your part i think she's called a lady is it a lena tyrell she's um something of a harridan oh yes i'm yeah she's she's also pretty evil i'm good at evil let's see how good of evil you are this is a little taster of this evil lady well watch a little clip let's let's look at it on the screen you came to dawn because you needed our help what is your name again barbara you look like an angry little boy don't presume to tell me what i need forgive my sister what she likes in diplomacy shut up dear anything from you no good let the grown women speak the lannisters it's a fantastic little clip because it gives a real sense of your strength and meanness yeah but it's also down to the script writers i mean thank you to them for a good scene yeah well it's interesting because uh you know i've on hard talk interviewed quite a number of actors female actors over the years who've bemoaned the dearth of great parts for women as as they get older and progress through careers have you experienced that or is that not your experience i i've truly been lucky i really have and i think um in a sense i sort of uh developed and and and become a better actress as i've grown older do you think it's because some actors female actors are too picky i mean you know because it is it's again it's become something of a cliche almost and i quote you one brilliant actor kristen scott thomas who says you know i know all the stories of older women not getting jobs in film can be so very boring but it is true it's a disaster well i think i think she's talking about film uh is that different i think it is different and and i can't comment because my film career is pretty well negligible i've done the odd film but i'm not famous for film my film work well we'll get to film work because there is one particular role you played which has gone down in history because it was a bond movie and everybody remembers bond movies but i don't want to get there just yet i i want to stick with in a sense the way in which game of thrones mirrors something you did early in your career which was another cult tv series and that is the avengers very different eras different styles but there's something actually quite similar about the way both captured the spirit of an age would you agree yes i think so i mean she emma peale i do hate the name oh talk about cliche but anyway emma peale was way ahead of her time and the reason for that was that um originally it was two fellows it was um patrick mcnee and another actor whose name escapes me and he dropped out and on a blackman took over and they didn't change the script so it was a part written for a man that ended up being played by a woman and maybe that's why so many people have said my god this was revolutionary it was a really proper strong independent equal part for a woman that's right and that's because that actually wasn't supposed to be for a woman exactly that's how it happened yeah and you took over from honor blackman you were very young i mean you sort of paid your dues in theater provincial theater the rsc as well doing shakespeare and then suddenly you were plucked out of all that and told you you were going to have this really rather glamorous part in a in a new tv show i left um i was with the royal shakespeare company for five years and i would sort of work my way up and uh to play leads and um and i i left uh because i sensed i had to broaden myself i didn't want just to be a shakespearean actress and the world of television was there sort of beckoning in a way and i was incredibly lucky to get an audition and and and to get the part well for those on the planet who don't remember the avengers and that sort of 60s sort of style that it encapsulated let's have a look at a clip of m appeal supersleuth in the avengers and in a very particular uh getter let's have a look give me the gun back up [Music] give me the gun [Music] [Applause] that's sweet it's compelling stuff i mean obviously i'm not going to mess with you in the studio given what i've just seen but um how do you feel about watching that now because if anybody mentions your name i think the first images conjured up are of the catsuit and of em appeal and uh do you like that or is that actually quite frustrating no i i'm i'm again i'm very grateful the only frustrating part about it was the suit was oh god it was uncomfortable and it took me a good half hour to go to the lava trick getting out of that thing you know peeling it off um but it i'm very grateful to it and really it it it suddenly projected me in beyond years of work in the theater yeah i mean that that is frustrating in a way for somebody who loves theater so much that you know you can cut through and reach a massive audience with a only two years as it was yes on that show in a way that years and years and years of classical theater yeah and um i went back um i think it was after the second year i went back to stratford to do 12th night to say look hey i can put bums on seats and in fact i was doing the two um together i was filming the avengers and doing 12 tonight just one thing about that that intrigues me because they've been all sorts of different analyses uh of what m appeal represented and a lot of it is seen through a sort of feminist prism some feminists say she was fantastic she was revolutionary because she was a strong independent phenomenally capable woman who was an equal partner with a man and others have said oh yeah but how terrible that this sort of independent woman had to be put in high heels and a cat suit and looked so very glam you know men didn't have to go through all that do they want hairy legs i mean you know you can't of course it was if you're playing the lead on on in a television series um and and in that sort of series uh why not present glamour at the same time as uh self-sufficiency i don't i don't see any problem with that as a very successful actor in your 20s 30s getting more and more successful would you would you say you had feminist instincts um i've always had feminist instincts where parity of of salary is concerned i mean i think an awful lot of it is um still a huge issue today it is a huge in hollywood there are campaigns of women actors where we've watched um the tennis players fight their fight um actresses are constantly fighting in in uh america about it i mean catherine hepburn uh kicked it all off many many years ago and it's absolutely ridiculous chasm between men and women sure is it true that you discovered on the set of the avengers that the male cameramen were earning more than you yes and then when i um complained and it hit the newspapers i was dubbed incredibly mercenary and in those days i wouldn't be now you were friends with patrick my knee who was your co-star was he being paid much more than you i never asked him we never got there i didn't want to put him in that situation i was it was my fight and i had to fight it by myself here's another thing that i'm interested in looking back is wonderful looking at the old footage we talked about game of thrones and today's young acting stars in games game of thrones are plunged into a world of celebrity uh and they become magazine fodder and everything else it was a different era in in the mid late 60s when you were doing the avengers i wonder if there was an element of that for you and how you felt about the celebrity culture that may have come your way i i was completely unprepared for it completely um i think nowadays the young are prepared for it because they see it all around them they read it in the magazines and everything i i know i i was naive very naive and no idea and the the fan mail was flooding in i didn't have a secretary um it mounted up i put it all in the back of my mini and drove around with it feeling so guilty did you like it no i felt me guilty because i first of all i didn't have the photographs to send back which is what they're all wanting i didn't know how to set about dealing with fan mail at all and it took me a good long time to to work it all out i think people get help now in in the sense that maybe the studios help them or somebody helps them but i just have my mother yeah you've also said i i like this comment you said you when you're acting with the game of thrones cast you sometimes look at them and you think darling hearts of the young ones darling hearts you have no idea what the rest of your life is going to be like unless you put in a proper apprenticeship and if i sound like an old bag banging on like this then that's what i am yeah it's true do you feel that today's generation of successful young actors aren't really sort of putting in the world they're suddenly catapulted into um this this world of series and it is one world but it isn't the only world and um i i think you know that what i've always believed is the stage gives you longevity i think um film the more a film will spit you out at a certain age the more of television will spit you out at a certain age but theater never does that and they really need to step on stage and discover what their true worth is through the audience yeah fascinating talking of film you say film can spit you out as an actor so easily but there are certain roles that live long in the memory and i think you can lay claim to one of them uh with your role in one of the bond movies yes on her majesty's secret service which is remembered i suppose partly because it was the only bond role played by george lazenby but also because your female character the love interest was actually quite different from most bond girls it was a deeper character a more human character and actually ended up with a marriage between your character and bond himself let's just see how you played the role alongside bond no sign of them yet or of someone saying thank you thank you tracy you've got sharp eyes and beautiful earlobes what were you doing so near bis gloria now i have a new interest in life with the sports egg very wholesome just one winter sportsman and bar told me where to find him [Applause] just keep my mind on your driving there you are tracy de vincenzo i believe your character was called was that fun because a lot of women who've played in bond as quote unquote bond girls get pigeonholed and i wonder whether you felt you did or whether you escaped that no no no not at all really not i mean i think uh yeah no not i can't afterwards say it was quite difficult playing alongside george george was difficult and there's no mistake about it um and as a result he was not invited back um but nonetheless i really wasn't up to it no he was perfectly good he really really was i i think i mean i haven't seen it for ages apart from that cut um i thought he was yes he was good um but he was just so difficult off and demanding and um and the producers thought enough you know uh film folklore has it that because your relationship with him was quite difficult you you ate garlic before the yeah that was that was so silly he accused me of that and in fact he actually accused you of yeah he did and in fact what happened was that i'd had uh mistakenly i'd had uh pate chicken liver patty for lunch and they'd put garlic in it but i didn't i didn't mean to and i'm absolutely certain that prior to the um the snogging scene i'd i'd actually done everything that actors do clean your teeth and chew gum and spray and all that kind of stuff but he thought because he was paranoid by this time he thought i'd done it on purpose which i hadn't i wouldn't dream of doing so i'm so glad we've cleared that up well i'm glad too because it's lingered for 25 years let me ask you about confidence and security stroke insecurity in the acting profession you you have said over the years that you look back on on the roles you played and the the life you led as a younger actor and and you wished you'd been more confident and happier in your own skin yes um you actually it it uh lack of confidence is a form of self-torture it's ridiculous and i forget who it was either olivier if somebody said it's it's uh you're you're you're being selfish when you're worried and and worrying about yourself you know um because acting is is giving out and being um unconfident is sort of hunging yourself and a bit inward looking um and i'd sort of think i wasted time not having enough confidence and is that because you had a wonderful period i guess in the 1990s when you won a host of awards for a really huge part that was just such a glorious time i mean thanks to the director jonathan kent with whom i worked one after the other you know medea federer um hippolytus uh mother courage it was he who put me up there and he who showed faith in me uh and i have nothing but gratitude for that period of my life because it really was wonderful and i i was very very lucky not many actresses get the opportunity to play these parts one after the other i mean how lucky was that well i don't think it's luck is it it's talent but also a great thing that you seem to have done is you seem to have come to a clear understanding that that you know theater has its ups and downs and that you can get bad reviews and in the end it's better to sort of shrug your shoulders or laugh at them than get deeply wounded by them yeah you've got to you've got to move on just move on have you had lousy reviews that stick in your mind well uh the worst one um was when i did um on broadway avalon eloise and we did a nude scene uh keith michelle and i um we had sort of uh what do you mean nothing knickers off and deeply uncomfortable and absolutely horrible and cold and there was a um what was he always called john simon he was small rather ugly hungarian gentleman who said i uh diana rigg is built like a brick mausoleum with insufficient flying buttresses we'll try and get over that i can imagine you would remember that how to how to play the nude scene afterwards i mean just horrible but what's beautiful is you you've you've found the humor in it and also you've now turned it into a stage you know you've collected all these horrible reviews not just of yourself but many many other great actors as well and you you've got this book which has one of the best titles ever of no turn unstoned i mean it's become quite a thing in itself isn't it yes it has yeah um the point about bad notices is that you have to be able to they've got to be funny for a kickoff and mine is uh but also to be able to quote them is is cathartic it sort of halves the pain to get a laugh at the end of it do you think some actors are too serious about this just a bit trade of theirs just a bit yeah about themselves as well i mean there's a lot of laughter in in this profession a lot and um i think yes to be too serious is a grave mistake we're almost out of time i don't think anybody around the world would forgive me unless you tell me exactly what's happening with game of thrones i can't i think well give me the whole plot but when are you going back to filming oh yeah later on this year yeah in fact in a couple of months i think i haven't got the script yet so i don't know what's happening do you know if you're going to be killed off because there's so many killings in games no i haven't got a clue i do know that they're going to well they've announced that they're going to finish it next year right yeah so so it obviously has a you know it is ending then you'll find something else yeah absolutely damn diana rick it's been a pleasure thank you for being on hard talk thank you thank you very much indeed [Music] [Music] you
