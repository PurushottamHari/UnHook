1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,240
Watch the video.  Look,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,639
this plane went up and the plane will

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,160
not be able to take off properly.

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,480
Ok?  Look, it's gone, it's gone,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,039
and this happened yesterday, around 1:39.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,640
Ok?  Look at this, now it is

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,119
not able to take off properly.  You can see

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,359
it should go up now.  Its engines did

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,240
not work.  This is most likely what would have happened.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,480
And it will come down right away.  That's

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,200
why I started to descend.  It only

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
went up to 882 feet.  Then suddenly it came down.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
Now it will fall directly in Meghani Meghnani Nagar.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
This is okay, right?  It will fall in Meghnaani city.  The

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,280
BJ Medical College is here.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,520
Look, this terrible blast happened.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,160
Fell there in the college.  The doctors were eating food

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,239
as it was lunch time at that time.  It

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,199
was time to eat dinner.  It is being reported that five

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,280
doctors have died and many people

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,800
may be injured and there is only one survivor

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,920
left.  So this is a

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,879
very shocking scene friends and

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
Sam Salapor is an engineer.  The

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,560
hearing took place on April 17 last year.  Nothing happened.

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,600
He is a whistle blower.  He had said that the

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,479

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,680
parts being used in the Boeing aircraft that America is manufacturing are

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
very bad.

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,479
I also covered that lecture.  It

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,720
might break in the middle.  An incident happened last year,

32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,840
friends, Boeing was going to Alaska.   The

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,600
window broke.  You must be understanding that the

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,439
window got broken in the wind in the middle of the road.

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,000
So friends, today we will

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,720
do a tremendous analysis as to

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,479
who is ultimately responsible for whatever happened?  And

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,079
we will talk about many more things.  So this is my second

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,159
lecture.  Let us go into the technical details a bit.  I

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,000
hope you all are doing very well.

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,759
My name is Siddharth Agnihotri.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,880
Welcome to Study Close.

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:55,920
First look at some photos.  Look, it has

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,520
fallen in the mess area where the

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,119
doctors were having their meals.  I told you in the canteen yesterday that

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,799
it is a medical hostel.

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,280
I am really sorry.  This was the mess area.

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
This was the canteen.  Is it okay?  And friends, the

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
pictures and videos are such, what can I

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,920
say?  This is just the first picture

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,720
inside the airplane.  Some fake videos are also going

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,560
viral that someone is recording live.  Nothing

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,000
like this happened before the crash,

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
friends.  Fake video, old video, that video is

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,680
from Nepal.  Is it okay?  No

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,480
one has made a live recording like this before a crash.  Let me

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,680
tell you, don't read into it.

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,720
Look at these wheels of the plane.

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,720
Look at the wheels of the plane, look at this, look at this condition.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,480
This entire mess area here was telling that

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,879
60 to 80 doctors had come to eat food.  And

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,760
such pictures of burnt bodies everywhere are a

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,000
very painful scene.  So let's talk.

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,680
But friends, let me tell you that

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
today is the last day of our Dark Psychology course.

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
Today is the last day.  Now

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
after this the sale will come after three-four months.  This

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,599
course will cost ₹1000.  So today we will

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,200
close this coupon code.  Use positive coupon

70
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,720
code.  If you want to avoid manipulation.

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,480

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,239
Want to play Persuasion Influence Mind Games in a positive way.

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,319
You have seen the exploitation in Sonam Raghuvanshi's

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,800
case, so you should avail this course.  It

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
is only ₹500.  Psychologist Dr. Mayurka Das has

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
told this and has

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,080
given the link in the description and comment box.  So first of all

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,959
we see that ultimately

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
this Boeing is being made in America.  Now first let

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,440
us understand this.  America has a

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,480
monopoly.  Is it okay?

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,480
William Boeing during World War II: Although the Wright brothers had

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,480
made the airplane, William Boeing

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,400
said, give me the money and I will make the plane for you.

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,239
So, friends, during World War II,

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,680
America

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,280
gave a lot of money and it was during World War II that we

88
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
realised that we needed planes very badly.

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
So earlier

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
planes were made only for the military.  Later,

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,200
commercial planes also started being built.  So now

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
what happened after that is that after 20 years in 1960 we

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,519
see that Boeing came.  Now this

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
was a very big airplane.  Is it okay?  After that

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,640
France brought out its Air Bus.  These are the only two

96
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,319
countries right now.  The engines are also GE Electric, India has

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
paid a lot of money for the engines.

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,400
Delivery has not been done yet.  Bharat is

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,599
upset that brother you took the money when will

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,680
you deliver?  So both America and France

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,400
control the entire aviation industry.

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,400
You can assume that

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,319
if the Federal Aviation Authority of America says that

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
anyone's plane in the entire world is

105
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,320
bad, then it is not working.  No matter how good the

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,479
plane is.  China had produced a very nice plane.

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,199
Canada had brought in Bombardier,

108
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,360
which operates the trains.  The FA spoke out and the

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,960
European Aviation Agency said it's game

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,080
over because these people lobby.  It

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,919
costs $35 billion to build a plane.  A

112
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,560

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,320
plane worth lakhs, lakhs and crores of rupees arrives.  You are understanding that there are

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
8000 crores in one billion dollars.

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
You can calculate accordingly.

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,919
So much money comes, money is spent and

117
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000

118
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,400
lobbying in America means that this company

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,479
gives money to politicians.  No

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,800
action was taken against them.  Last time

121
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,320
one of their engineers had said that the

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
materials being used in Boeing are very

123
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,919
cheap.  The whistle was blurred

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,680
but no one paid attention to it

125
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,840
and no action was taken.

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
You can watch a very good documentary on Netflix.

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,240
American plane maker Boeing has said

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
that we will support Air India.  Which

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,759
is a deadly crash.  He said, okay, we

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,479
will investigate.  Isn't it?  There were

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,160
242 people in London on 12 June.  See, Boeing

132
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,600
comes in three variants.  This Boeing was

133
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,120
made in 2011.  And the Boeing 787 which has

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,360
just crashed, 7878, this

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,400
Boeing can seat 248 people.  Then

136
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,639
comes 7879 in which around 300 people

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,639
can sit.  Then comes the bigger 7 8 7 10

138
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,639
which can seat around 350 people.  So these are

139
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
big planes and it's really rubbish for

140
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,639
me because there are three seats in the middle,

141
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,800
three seats on the side and three seats on the side.  So

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,919
this is a vertical meaning horizontal arrangement of nine seats.

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,759
And now you know that Air India was

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,280
acquired by Tata.  So we are telling you

145
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,840
that we are in touch with Air India

146
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,160
regarding Flight 171 and we are

147
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
fully in support of them.  Our thoughts are

148
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
with the passengers.

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,320
is with the crew.  Our sympathies are with the first responders of

150
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,199
Air India Flight

151
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,600
171, which had 230 passengers.  There were two pilots and

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,800
10 crew members and 242 total members.   There

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,720
is only one survivor.  Ramesh Vishwa Kumar,

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,400
that too Vishwas Kumar who was sitting on seat 11A.

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
That is an emergency seat.

156
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,520
He ran away openly, very fast.  So

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,759
this is the first fatal crash.   The

158
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
Boeing 7 87 Dream Liner has never

159
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,759
crashed before.  That is why their stock markets have also

160
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,919
crashed.  And even before this,

161
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,280
operational issues have been seen.  I

162
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,400
told you that the engineer said that it will crack by 20

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,960
some day.

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,000
This is the thing.

165
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,720
Now this is a very wide body twin jet

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,240
intercontinental plane.  Most advanced

167
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,560
rejects are considered.  Although the

168
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
companies here had placed orders for Boeing 787, but till now

169
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,880
not many people have got it, that is Tata and

170
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,840
Wata.

171
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,840
So 7878, which was involved in the accident, was

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,639
given to India in 2014 and it is the

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,360
smallest.  It can carry 2048 passengers

174
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,479
and is fuel efficient.  Is it okay?

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,319
You will get a good amount of fuel in it.  20%

176
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,880
is effective.  Meaning 20% ​​less fuel will be used.

177
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,720
And there are two choices in this.  There are two

178
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,479
types of engines.  One is

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,400
offered by GE Airspace 787.  And the engine that crashed.

180
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,120
Ok?  That was supplied by GE, you know.   “This is a great way to improve your business,”

181
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,360
explains aviation consultant John M. Cox,

182
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,120
CEO of Safety Operating Systems.

183
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
He told the Associated Press

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,440
from Los Angeles that the aircraft's nose

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,400
was up and it was not going up.

186
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
And the biggest thing is that if the nose was up

187
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,160
then why did it not go up?  So

188
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,960
investigators will have to look at this.  And

189
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,919
right now at this point it is very very very

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,960
early.  We will not comment on this right now.  We do

191
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,199
n't know a lot about it, but the 787 does

192
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,199
extensive flight data monitoring.  Are

193
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,880
you understanding?  So once we

194
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,759
get the recorder and the black box, we will

195
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,800
know things.  Boeing has

196
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,879
sold approximately 2,500 planes so far.  Talking about 787,

197
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,919
47 of them have been sold to Air India.

198
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,759
1189 Jets Jets are

199
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:09,120
airliners or less so far

200
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,199
but there are production delays.  The thing is that the

201
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
order has been placed here.  take the money, take the

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,680
money.  A lot of money has been given but there

203
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
is a delay.  A plane cannot be made so quickly.

204
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
Different parts of the plane come from different places.

205
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,840
So now it is obvious that there

206
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,160
is pressure on you to deliver right now.

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,919
I give you money

208
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,000
in advance and you do not deliver the plane to me.  This

209
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,680
is the problem with them.  Still having engine

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,640
problems.  India also has

211
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
n't got Dream Liners yet and needs more.  So

212
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,719
brother there is pressure on them.  What is the reason behind this, that you just

213
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,880
install whatever part and sell it.

214
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,959
Now it is not the case that no safety

215
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,880
norms are followed.  But you

216
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,440
can see that in the recent

217
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,519
crashes that have happened, these are Boeing

218
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,680
aircraft.   The

219
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,640
787 first flew in 2011, about 1,400 (1400, I'm saying

220
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,800
14 years ago), and then around the same

221
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,560
time, in the same year, it

222
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,399
became a commercial airline.  This is the thing.  The range

223
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,120
and efficiency are excellent.  Everyone

224
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,839
bought it.  The one that Indigo uses is

225
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,760
France's Air Bus, a smaller A380 that

226
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,360
can accommodate fewer people.  Ok?

227
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,680
Not many people can come.  You can assume more than half,

228
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,360
around 100-150, but it

229
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,200
can include double of it.  The way the 787

230
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,240
is built, it is a very big plane.

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,320
This is a very heavy plane.  And the assembly takes place

232
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,560
in Washington, in North Charleson

233
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,760
, and in South Carolina.  But

234
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,680
friends, there have been previous incidents before this too.

235
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,560

236
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,160
In July 2013, an Ethiopian Airlines 7-87

237
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,320
caught fire.  A fire broke out on the ground itself.

238
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
That too London Ether Airport which is the biggest

239
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
airport in London.  It was later reported

240
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,760
that there was a short circuit.  There was a short circuit.

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,399
What happened?  See what I told you,

242
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,920
people do lobbying.  So, whatever

243
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,519
action is taken against them, consider it to be negligible.

244
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,959
In 2013, regulators grounded the global 787 fleet.  Had taken it

245
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,800
down.

246
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,640
Why?  The lithium batteries were overheated.

247
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,399
A lot of issues are seen with lithium batteries.  The

248
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
details that are coming

249
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,399
out are about

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,440
Japanese planes, two Japanese planes, one

251
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,920
in Tokyo and one in Boston.  Is it okay?  And

252
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,040
after that there were changes in the design.

253
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,519
Friends, in March last year, 50 people were injured.

254
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,279
This is what I am telling you

255
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,440
that LATAM LATAM mid flight, it was

256
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,279
going from Sydney to Auckland.  Okay and suddenly she

257
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,079
came down.

258
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,480
Exactly the same thing was said by the investigators

259
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,920
that there was forward movement of the pilot seat.

260
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,079
So brother, fresh scrutiny is

261
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,920
required.

262
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,680
Boeing needs to take a look.  Proper

263
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,839
investigation because look how many people died.

264
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,040
What's the matter with them?  These people will pay the money and leave.

265
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,000
Then an accident will happen here.  Two

266
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,320
deadly clashes have been seen of the 737 Boeing 737 that was made,

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,320
not of 787, the first

268
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,600
one is in 2018 and in 2019 346 people were killed,

269
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,560
this is the thing, the

270
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,240
company is currently in recovery mode, for six years Lion

271
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,800
Air Flight 610 which is a Boeing 737 Max 8,

272
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,519
crashed into the Java Sea in Indonesia, as soon as

273
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,720
it took off, Indonesian Airlines,

274
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,399
you might remember in 2019, 189 people were killed, it

275
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,560
crashed in Jakarta, it fell into the sea, it has

276
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:19,279
not been found yet.  Ethiopian

277
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:21,360
Airlines Flight 302 Boeing 737 MAX 8

278
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,480
crashes in Rdiba.  It is common for them to fall as soon as they take off.

279
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,680
This

280
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,240
is Boeing's problem.  157 passengers have been killed.

281
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,519
Last month, they had signed a deal

282
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,519

283
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,079
with the US Justice Department

284
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,040
that

285
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,920
we will get you relief from criminal responsibility.

286
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,720
According to the New York Times, Boeing is

287
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,880
not admitting it yet.  Please tell me whether

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,320
he has paid the fine or many times he just pays the fine and goes

289
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,560
away.  Last year in April 2014, the

290
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
US Federal Aviation

291
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,640
Administration said that

292
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,800

293
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,720
we will talk about the whistle blower who was told about by the Boeing engineer.  We

294
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,920
will investigate that.  But even in that, nothing

295
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,000
significant has progressed yet.  And

296
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,720
tell me about the tragedy that happened after that, I

297
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,639
mean all the 230 passengers died,

298
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
right?  Tata has said that we will give ₹ 1 crore.

299
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,360
 

300
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,399
But the most shocking part is not an

301
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,160
accident.  And it isn't the wreakage.  It's what happens

302
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,800
after.  What will happen next?

303
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,600
A mother will have to race her child alone.

304
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,880
His father is gone.  His father is gone.  The

305
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,000
father who used to play with his child is

306
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,279
gone.  An entire family was wiped out.  Do you

307
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,800
understand?  There was an Asian student.  He

308
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,440
thought that friend, I will make a very good career.

309
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,240
He died.

310
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,399
Who will talk about them?

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,160
All these things will be in place within three-four days.  But for him it

312
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,399
became a lifelong trauma.

313
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,240
We think that the insurance will take

314
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000
care of everything.  It takes care of everything.

315
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,760
No.

316
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,440
What is not covered is more devastating.

317
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
Studies show that being uninsured

318
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,560
or underinsured

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,600
can cost up to 70% more than what

320
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,880
insurance gives you.  So the family does

321
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,959
lose their you know loved ones

322
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,279
but they don’t get any special help nor any

323
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,120
recognition.

324
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,760
Who will tell the story of 242 people?

325
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,000
Therapy for the children, spouses, parents,

326
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,760
this trauma will

327
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,720
continue to haunt them for years.  Dreams will come, promotions,

328
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:43,839
pensions, birthdays, milestones all gone.

329
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,760
In many cultures

330
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,760
if you say goodbye it isn't a one day

331
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,480
affair.  Ceremonies, travels,

332
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,959
gatherings matter a lot

333
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,079
to a family.

334
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,399
But this is it now.  We do not talk about all these things.

335
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,399

336
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,320
Safety is not just about protocols.

337
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,480
This is for the people.  Do you understand?  We

338
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
need a culture that recognizes the human being.

339
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,399
Recognize human life.

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,920
We should support.  Families

341
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,320
should be supported.  Long term

342
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,320
psychological care should be provided.  The

343
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,120
investigators, the responders,

344
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,440
and the families,

345
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,720
both the legal and financial systems should help them

346
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,120
with dignity.

347
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,480
So if we pay attention to these things it will be

348
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,920
better.  But the truth is that

349
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,199
scrutiny of Boeing is necessary here.  Things won't work like this.

350
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,959
Because this

351
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,399
