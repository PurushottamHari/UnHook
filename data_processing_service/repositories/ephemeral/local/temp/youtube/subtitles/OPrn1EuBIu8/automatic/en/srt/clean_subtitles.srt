Watch the video.  Look, this plane went up and the plane will not be able to take off properly. Ok?  Look, it's gone, it's gone, and this happened yesterday, around 1:39. Ok?  Look at this, now it is not able to take off properly.  You can see it should go up now.  Its engines did not work.  This is most likely what would have happened. And it will come down right away.  That's why I started to descend.  It only went up to 882 feet.  Then suddenly it came down. Now it will fall directly in Meghani Meghnani Nagar. This is okay, right?  It will fall in Meghnaani city.  The BJ Medical College is here. Look, this terrible blast happened. Fell there in the college.  The doctors were eating food as it was lunch time at that time.  It was time to eat dinner.  It is being reported that five doctors have died and many people may be injured and there is only one survivor left.  So this is a very shocking scene friends and Sam Salapor is an engineer.  The hearing took place on April 17 last year.  Nothing happened. He is a whistle blower.  He had said that the parts being used in the Boeing aircraft that America is manufacturing are very bad. I also covered that lecture.  It might break in the middle.  An incident happened last year, friends, Boeing was going to Alaska.   The window broke.  You must be understanding that the window got broken in the wind in the middle of the road. So friends, today we will do a tremendous analysis as to who is ultimately responsible for whatever happened?  And we will talk about many more things.  So this is my second lecture.  Let us go into the technical details a bit.  I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddharth Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Close. First look at some photos.  Look, it has fallen in the mess area where the doctors were having their meals.  I told you in the canteen yesterday that it is a medical hostel. I am really sorry.  This was the mess area. This was the canteen.  Is it okay?  And friends, the pictures and videos are such, what can I say?  This is just the first picture inside the airplane.  Some fake videos are also going viral that someone is recording live.  Nothing like this happened before the crash, friends.  Fake video, old video, that video is from Nepal.  Is it okay?  No one has made a live recording like this before a crash.  Let me tell you, don't read into it. Look at these wheels of the plane. Look at the wheels of the plane, look at this, look at this condition. This entire mess area here was telling that 60 to 80 doctors had come to eat food.  And such pictures of burnt bodies everywhere are a very painful scene.  So let's talk. But friends, let me tell you that today is the last day of our Dark Psychology course. Today is the last day.  Now after this the sale will come after three-four months.  This course will cost ₹1000.  So today we will close this coupon code.  Use positive coupon code.  If you want to avoid manipulation. Want to play Persuasion Influence Mind Games in a positive way. You have seen the exploitation in Sonam Raghuvanshi's case, so you should avail this course.  It is only ₹500.  Psychologist Dr. Mayurka Das has told this and has given the link in the description and comment box.  So first of all we see that ultimately this Boeing is being made in America.  Now first let us understand this.  America has a monopoly.  Is it okay? William Boeing during World War II: Although the Wright brothers had made the airplane, William Boeing said, give me the money and I will make the plane for you. So, friends, during World War II, America gave a lot of money and it was during World War II that we realised that we needed planes very badly. So earlier planes were made only for the military.  Later, commercial planes also started being built.  So now what happened after that is that after 20 years in 1960 we see that Boeing came.  Now this was a very big airplane.  Is it okay?  After that France brought out its Air Bus.  These are the only two countries right now.  The engines are also GE Electric, India has paid a lot of money for the engines. Delivery has not been done yet.  Bharat is upset that brother you took the money when will you deliver?  So both America and France control the entire aviation industry. You can assume that if the Federal Aviation Authority of America says that anyone's plane in the entire world is bad, then it is not working.  No matter how good the plane is.  China had produced a very nice plane. Canada had brought in Bombardier, which operates the trains.  The FA spoke out and the European Aviation Agency said it's game over because these people lobby.  It costs $35 billion to build a plane.  A plane worth lakhs, lakhs and crores of rupees arrives.  You are understanding that there are 8000 crores in one billion dollars. You can calculate accordingly. So much money comes, money is spent and lobbying in America means that this company gives money to politicians.  No action was taken against them.  Last time one of their engineers had said that the materials being used in Boeing are very cheap.  The whistle was blurred but no one paid attention to it and no action was taken. You can watch a very good documentary on Netflix. American plane maker Boeing has said that we will support Air India.  Which is a deadly crash.  He said, okay, we will investigate.  Isn't it?  There were 242 people in London on 12 June.  See, Boeing comes in three variants.  This Boeing was made in 2011.  And the Boeing 787 which has just crashed, 7878, this Boeing can seat 248 people.  Then comes 7879 in which around 300 people can sit.  Then comes the bigger 7 8 7 10 which can seat around 350 people.  So these are big planes and it's really rubbish for me because there are three seats in the middle, three seats on the side and three seats on the side.  So this is a vertical meaning horizontal arrangement of nine seats. And now you know that Air India was acquired by Tata.  So we are telling you that we are in touch with Air India regarding Flight 171 and we are fully in support of them.  Our thoughts are with the passengers. is with the crew.  Our sympathies are with the first responders of Air India Flight 171, which had 230 passengers.  There were two pilots and 10 crew members and 242 total members.   There is only one survivor.  Ramesh Vishwa Kumar, that too Vishwas Kumar who was sitting on seat 11A. That is an emergency seat. He ran away openly, very fast.  So this is the first fatal crash.   The Boeing 7 87 Dream Liner has never crashed before.  That is why their stock markets have also crashed.  And even before this, operational issues have been seen.  I told you that the engineer said that it will crack by 20 some day. This is the thing. Now this is a very wide body twin jet intercontinental plane.  Most advanced rejects are considered.  Although the companies here had placed orders for Boeing 787, but till now not many people have got it, that is Tata and Wata. So 7878, which was involved in the accident, was given to India in 2014 and it is the smallest.  It can carry 2048 passengers and is fuel efficient.  Is it okay? You will get a good amount of fuel in it.  20% is effective.  Meaning 20% ​​less fuel will be used. And there are two choices in this.  There are two types of engines.  One is offered by GE Airspace 787.  And the engine that crashed. Ok?  That was supplied by GE, you know.   “This is a great way to improve your business,” explains aviation consultant John M. Cox, CEO of Safety Operating Systems. He told the Associated Press from Los Angeles that the aircraft's nose was up and it was not going up. And the biggest thing is that if the nose was up then why did it not go up?  So investigators will have to look at this.  And right now at this point it is very very very early.  We will not comment on this right now.  We do n't know a lot about it, but the 787 does extensive flight data monitoring.  Are you understanding?  So once we get the recorder and the black box, we will know things.  Boeing has sold approximately 2,500 planes so far.  Talking about 787, 47 of them have been sold to Air India. 1189 Jets Jets are airliners or less so far but there are production delays.  The thing is that the order has been placed here.  take the money, take the money.  A lot of money has been given but there is a delay.  A plane cannot be made so quickly. Different parts of the plane come from different places. So now it is obvious that there is pressure on you to deliver right now. I give you money in advance and you do not deliver the plane to me.  This is the problem with them.  Still having engine problems.  India also has n't got Dream Liners yet and needs more.  So brother there is pressure on them.  What is the reason behind this, that you just install whatever part and sell it. Now it is not the case that no safety norms are followed.  But you can see that in the recent crashes that have happened, these are Boeing aircraft.   The 787 first flew in 2011, about 1,400 (1400, I'm saying 14 years ago), and then around the same time, in the same year, it became a commercial airline.  This is the thing.  The range and efficiency are excellent.  Everyone bought it.  The one that Indigo uses is France's Air Bus, a smaller A380 that can accommodate fewer people.  Ok? Not many people can come.  You can assume more than half, around 100-150, but it can include double of it.  The way the 787 is built, it is a very big plane. This is a very heavy plane.  And the assembly takes place in Washington, in North Charleson , and in South Carolina.  But friends, there have been previous incidents before this too. In July 2013, an Ethiopian Airlines 7-87 caught fire.  A fire broke out on the ground itself. That too London Ether Airport which is the biggest airport in London.  It was later reported that there was a short circuit.  There was a short circuit. What happened?  See what I told you, people do lobbying.  So, whatever action is taken against them, consider it to be negligible. In 2013, regulators grounded the global 787 fleet.  Had taken it down. Why?  The lithium batteries were overheated. A lot of issues are seen with lithium batteries.  The details that are coming out are about Japanese planes, two Japanese planes, one in Tokyo and one in Boston.  Is it okay?  And after that there were changes in the design. Friends, in March last year, 50 people were injured. This is what I am telling you that LATAM LATAM mid flight, it was going from Sydney to Auckland.  Okay and suddenly she came down. Exactly the same thing was said by the investigators that there was forward movement of the pilot seat. So brother, fresh scrutiny is required. Boeing needs to take a look.  Proper investigation because look how many people died. What's the matter with them?  These people will pay the money and leave. Then an accident will happen here.  Two deadly clashes have been seen of the 737 Boeing 737 that was made, not of 787, the first one is in 2018 and in 2019 346 people were killed, this is the thing, the company is currently in recovery mode, for six years Lion Air Flight 610 which is a Boeing 737 Max 8, crashed into the Java Sea in Indonesia, as soon as it took off, Indonesian Airlines, you might remember in 2019, 189 people were killed, it crashed in Jakarta, it fell into the sea, it has not been found yet.  Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes in Rdiba.  It is common for them to fall as soon as they take off. This is Boeing's problem.  157 passengers have been killed. Last month, they had signed a deal with the US Justice Department that we will get you relief from criminal responsibility. According to the New York Times, Boeing is not admitting it yet.  Please tell me whether he has paid the fine or many times he just pays the fine and goes away.  Last year in April 2014, the US Federal Aviation Administration said that we will talk about the whistle blower who was told about by the Boeing engineer.  We will investigate that.  But even in that, nothing significant has progressed yet.  And tell me about the tragedy that happened after that, I mean all the 230 passengers died, right?  Tata has said that we will give ₹ 1 crore. But the most shocking part is not an accident.  And it isn't the wreakage.  It's what happens after.  What will happen next? A mother will have to race her child alone. His father is gone.  His father is gone.  The father who used to play with his child is gone.  An entire family was wiped out.  Do you understand?  There was an Asian student.  He thought that friend, I will make a very good career. He died. Who will talk about them? All these things will be in place within three-four days.  But for him it became a lifelong trauma. We think that the insurance will take care of everything.  It takes care of everything. No. What is not covered is more devastating. Studies show that being uninsured or underinsured can cost up to 70% more than what insurance gives you.  So the family does lose their you know loved ones but they don’t get any special help nor any recognition. Who will tell the story of 242 people? Therapy for the children, spouses, parents, this trauma will continue to haunt them for years.  Dreams will come, promotions, pensions, birthdays, milestones all gone. In many cultures if you say goodbye it isn't a one day affair.  Ceremonies, travels, gatherings matter a lot to a family. But this is it now.  We do not talk about all these things. Safety is not just about protocols. This is for the people.  Do you understand?  We need a culture that recognizes the human being. Recognize human life. We should support.  Families should be supported.  Long term psychological care should be provided.  The investigators, the responders, and the families, both the legal and financial systems should help them with dignity. So if we pay attention to these things it will be better.  But the truth is that scrutiny of Boeing is necessary here.  Things won't work like this. Because this is a question of the life of all of us, friends.  We are not travelling today.  You will travel tomorrow, right? Be happy, keep reading.  This is a proven signing off.  The link to the remaining courses is given in the description and comment box. What do you think, please tell me in the comment box. Thank you so much.
