1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,520
Friends, do you think that every

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,120
way is justified in war

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,320
?  No, this does not happen.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,599
Whenever there are war conditions within a war, there

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,880
should not be any human casualties in it.  A common

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,680
man should not die.  Any how

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,039
in any condition.  If he dies then we

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,480
say that a genocide is taking place.  Innocent

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,119
people are being killed.  Today

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,120
the media publishes very little about Israel.

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,320
But that doesn’t mean Israel has

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,719
n’t committed genocide in Gaza.   What is the

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,360
most terrible genocide is the one carried out

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,640
by Israel on Gaza.  Even though the media may have

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,440
covered it less.  What has

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,960
happened recently is that Iran has dropped cluster bombs

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,000
on Israel and many buildings in

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,480
important cities of Israel like Tlaib, have been

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,719
destroyed.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,399
But some people are saying that the

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,320
bombs used by Iran,

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,159
cluster bombs,

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,360
doing so is illegal, it is illegal

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,159
according to international laws.  And if Iran does this,

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,720
we will consider it a genocide.  But

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,799
Iran has used it.  So was Iran

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,280
using this tactic thinking that

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,400
I have to kill Israeli civilians as well who are

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,400
innocent?  Ultimately we will know

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,799
what controversy is behind this.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,439
But what has happened so far

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,200
?  First, let them understand.  Look, the first thing is

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,200
that Iran is more important than us.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,920
Israel

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,240
needs to understand, not Iran, that Israel is being

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040
used as a puppet

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,520
by the USA.  USA developed its market

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,920
inside Israel.  USA developed it

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,799
inside Pakistan.  USA developed

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,200
inside Ukraine.  So today Israel is being

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,840
used as a puppet.  It is

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,159
happening like a puppet and the same puppet is now dancing

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,520
and by dancing it is

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,520
harming others.  The treaty, that is to say, the

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,479
Nuclear Band Treaty, was

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,759
between America and Iran.  But

47
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,040
why did Israel jump into the middle?  Because if

48
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,760
Iran is not accepting America's demand then it should be made to

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,720
accept it through Israel and

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
when Israel attacks then whatever Israel is inside it

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
can also be wiped out.  This will

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,160
not have any direct impact on America.

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,080
So America attacks in a covert manner.

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,000
America fights guerilla warfare so that its reality is

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,599
not exposed to the people and countries.  So let me

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,120
brief you a little.

58
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,599
Where did it start from?  From October 7, 2023, when the

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
Nova Music Festival was going on inside Israel

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,760
and Hamas fighters reached there.

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
They started firing there in

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,160
which many Israeli

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,120
citizens were killed.  Israel retaliated against

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,920
Hamas because Hamas is a group of the

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
Axis of Resistance and Iran's

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,360
IRGC supports Hamas.

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Therefore Israel decided to destroy Hamas

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,599
because Gaza was above the Strip.

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Therefore, the people living inside Gaza were

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,080
also killed there.  There is hunger there,

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
nutrition is spread there but

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,959
it makes no difference to Israel.

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,920
Israel simply has to win its war.  In the

74
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,239
meanwhile, Iran enters the country and its

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,480
entry happens in such a manner that Israel is the

76
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,080
first one to attack Iran.

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,400
And that was done because Iran was

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,879

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,879
supporting the military rivals like the Hotez and Hezbollah.

80
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,080
And Israel already knew this.

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,040
Israel attacked Iran and

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,599
how did it do it?  It was done through Mousasad.  Mossad, which was an

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,159
intelligence agency, had already

84
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,080
deployed missiles inside Iran and Israel had

85
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,560
started attacking Iran's

86
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,799
nuclear facilities.  Now Iran has

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,040
also started retaliating against it and has

88
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,280

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,720
started using cluster bombs in it.  Now let's

90
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,879
see what happens next.  We will

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,439
know what exactly cluster bombs are

92
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,760
?  How does it work?  When has it been

93
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,319
used?  Why have Israel and Iran

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,159
not signed that treaty yet

95
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,480
?  In which a

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,239
ban can be imposed on the use of cluster bombs.

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
This treaty was signed in 2008.  We

98
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,199
will talk about it in great detail.  First

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,280
look at the condition of the city.  In this

100
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,680
you people can see that this building is completely

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,000
damaged.  Cluster bombs have been used on these.

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,400

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,199
Ok?  Now, Israel had targeted the nuclear

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,400
facilities in Tehran-Natanz, which

105
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,880
were very important for Iran,

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,120
all the underground facilities there, the nuclear

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,040
facilities, were targeted there.

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,840
Well, Israel did

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,160
not cause much damage to Iran.  Then the

110
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,960
conflict between the two remains at the highest level.

111
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,400
Now the thing is that in this conflict, the

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,520
leader of Iran's defense, whom

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,479
we call Brigadier General Majid

114
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,000
Khadani Khadami, was

115
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,440
killed in the attack.  That means

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,440
Mohammad Khazami who was killed in the sorry attack and then

117
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,680
what was Khadami made of here

118
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,840
?  The General who is the commander of the IRGC was

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,039
made a General.  Ok?  So,

120
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,800
he died.  Because of this, Iran was completely

121
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,440
shattered.  Iran started to feel that

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Israel has penetrated very deep

123
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,919
today.  So there

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,520
is a need to answer somewhere.  And then Iran's

125
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,160
way of responding, in the meantime an incident happens that 40 military aircrafts from all the

126
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,759
air force bases that America had

127
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,440
built in Qatar,

128
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,000
disappear.  I do

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,280
n't know where he went.  It was being said that when

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,400
those 40 military aircraft suddenly

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,560
disappeared from Qatar, it was said

132
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,440
that they had left to attack Iran.

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,560

134
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,280
They have set out to attack Iran.  I don't know where he went.  Now,

135
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,639
USA was already trying in its different countries, like

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,440
Qatar, Israel, Maldives,

137
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,039
Bangladesh.

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,280
It was said in Bangladesh that

139
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,280
give us this island.

140
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,160
But Bangladesh refused.  Sheikh Hasina was

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,160
removed.  So

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
what has the USA done?  Pakistan has

143
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,639

144
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,280
deployed its military bases everywhere in Afghanistan.  Similarly, it

145
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,680
is the same in Qatar and from there, 40

146
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,000
fighter jets suddenly disappeared from there

147
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,720
and it was told that they have left from there to attack Iran.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,720

149
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
Now let us talk about

150
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
what these cluster bombs are and

151
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,160
why are they so dangerous?  How does it

152
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
work?  We know about this.

153
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,199
First of all you guys look at this photograph.

154
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,400
Inside this photograph you can

155
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,600
see a huge iron container

156
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,840
and these small bombs are visible inside it.  It

157
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,080
seems like these are

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,039
not bombs, friend.  It looks as if laddus are kept there.

159
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,080
But this is not a laddu.  Yes, if a

160
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,800
small child or a woman

161
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,960
picks it up thinking it to be a laddu, it will burst.  Actually,

162
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,880
what happens is that

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,759
small bombs are kept inside a big container.

164
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,000
These same bombs are then deployed for attack.

165
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,560
Well right now we will

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,800
see that

167
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,440

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,199
you guys should first understand the mathematics of the bomb that Israel, i.e. Iran, has used on Israel.

169
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,680
See

170
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,039
what Iran did, they took a big container

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,800
and placed 20 bombs inside that container.

172
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,880
 

173
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,919
Keep the bombs.  How many?  Keep 20 bombs.   There

174
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,720
weren't many.

175
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,479
Kept it within that number and took it over that city.  Like

176
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
I just showed you a photograph

177
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,880
of a building that was in a bad state.

178
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,280
You look at this building.  If an

179
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,759
attack is to be made using a cluster bomb, then this bomb can be dropped

180
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,639
approximately 8 km from the ground.  Placed above.  8

181
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,400
Km  Placed on top, there were

182
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,560
almost 20 bombs inside this cluster.  8 Km  While keeping it aloft,

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,720
it was blasted mid-air.

184
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,680
And its radius was about 7 to 8

185
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,840
km.  It covered the radius.  Wherever

186
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,560
these bombs fell, they

187
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,280
started exploding.  It was not even seen whether there was a

188
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,840
child, a woman or an

189
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,960
innocent person there.  There was no news of this whatsoever.

190
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,280
That is why when these bombs attack, the

191
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,319
attack is so powerful that

192
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,599
every surrounding establishment gets

193
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,199
destroyed.  Now this was not a targeted war.

194
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:29,039
Brother, America says that we have

195
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,199
always fought a targeted war; we have attacked

196
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,519
only those who are guilty and those who are terrorists.

197
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,760
But if cluster

198
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,399
bombs are used then their radius will be about

199
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399
7 to 8 km.  It is of and approximately 8

200
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,560
Km.  It blasts from the top

201
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,440
and after the blast its bombs scatter.  The

202
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,680
special thing about bombs is

203
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,040
that some of them

204
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,360
explode after hitting any building.

205
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,360
Blasts happen.  But there are some

206
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,320
bombs which sink into the soil

207
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,399
and do not explode.  Decades later, when

208
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,040
it explodes, someone or the other

209
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,920
dies in it.  This is the biggest problem.

210
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,000
So the thing here is that these are not targeted

211
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,680
and spread completely within that area in

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,399
this manner.  Now

213
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,560
how can this be released?  You

214
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
look inside this diagram.  Actually it is a very large

215
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,080
iron container.  There is another smaller container inside that container in which

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,360
we have

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,160
filled those bombs.  Now, this bomb, that is,

218
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,200
this entire cluster, we

219
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,000

220
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,640
target it either with a drone or a missile, and

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,560
after targeting, these bombs

222
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
go in different directions and spread.  And

223
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,959
what will happen wherever they collide

224
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,120
?  There will be a blast.  I hope you guys have understood.

225
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,440
But where has it been used now

226
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,560
?  It was first used during the Second World

227
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,200
War.  The number we have just

228
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,519
told you is only 20.  20 numbers

229
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,519
means only 20 bombs are

230
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,240
placed in one cluster.  But at the time of the Second

231
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,880
World War, around 100

232
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,360
bombs were kept in a cluster.

233
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,600
But gradually their number started decreasing

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,320
and a small cluster

235
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,880
started being made and 20 bombs were placed in it.  Recently, that is

236
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,200
last year,

237
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,160
when there was a conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, there was a

238
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,200
boundary dispute regarding this area between

239
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,480
Azerbaijan and Armenia, then neither of

240
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,240
them negotiated,

241
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,399
but what happened was that cluster bombs were

242
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,880
used by Azerbaijan,

243
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,720
Azerbaijan used it

244
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,880
inside Armenia and

245
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
Armenia used it on Azerbaijan, both of them

246
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,800

247
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,560
used cluster bombs on each other.  Now one thing should be clear to you here

248
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,519
that

249
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,680
making cluster bombs is

250
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,880
not against the treaty anywhere.  But using it is

251
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,360
against that treaty.  Now see, every

252
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,800
year there is a summit which is called

253
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,120
Convention and Cluster Munitions.

254
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,600

255
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,000
Every year

256
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,959
a meeting is held regarding the ban on the cluster bombs that are made.  A convention takes place.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,120
Such a meeting took place in 2008.  It

258
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,839
happened in 2008.  At that time it was decided

259
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,279
that cluster bombs would not be made.  And

260
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,120
since 2008, 111 countries have

261
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,279
signed it and agreed

262
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,000
that yes, we will not make cluster bombs.

263
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,399
But Israel and Iran did

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,120
not sign that treaty of that convention.  did

265
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,279
not agree with him and what did he

266
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,519
do?  Now recently they have

267
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,480
started using cluster bombs.  So

268
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,279
whenever a cluster bomb falls, it makes a tremendous impact.

269
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,600
Now you guys will see that Canada has

270
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,160
signed it.  Mexico has

271
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,320
signed but the United States has

272
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,560
not signed that convention, that treaty,

273
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,560
which deals with cluster bombs because

274
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,360
cluster bombs were also used by the United States

275
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,760
inside Afghanistan.  Neither India

276
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,000
nor Pakistan has signed it.

277
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,720
So here you will

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,120
see that those countries which have rated themselves are those which have

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,519

280
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,279
very little need to use bombs.  And those who

281
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
use more bombs like Russia

282
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,040
etc., Ukraine etc.  He has never

283
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,959
signed it.  Okay,

284
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,040
what happened now?  What did Russia do?

285
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,240
Cluster bombs used over Ukraine.

286
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
 

287
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
Later Ukraine

288
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,639
confirmed that Russia had

289
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
used these cluster bombs on us.  So

290
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,720
USA said okay we will also

291
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,120
give you cluster bombs and those

292
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,279
cluster bombs reached inside Ukraine and then they attacked

293
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,200
Russia.  So cluster bombs have been

294
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,680
used for a long time

295
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,560
and what has Iran done recently?

296
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,880
Israel has been attacked with cluster bombs.

297
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880
Now how far can this conflict go

298
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,399
?  Let me give you an idea of

299
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,839
how far it can go.  Look, this will reach a point

300
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,000
where Israel will run out of weapons

301
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,160
and Israel will run out of money.

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,959
Iran has no shortage of money.

303
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,000
He will die and be destroyed but will

304
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,160
not stop the war.  This war will stop when

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,600
Israel runs out of money to buy weapons

306
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,360
and Israel will say that

307
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,440
yes, now we need weapons but

308
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,000
we don't have money.  This war

309
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,160
can stop only then.  Apart from this there is no chance

310
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
that the war will stop.  What do you think?  You

311
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,399
