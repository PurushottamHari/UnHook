Friends, do you think that every way is justified in war ?  No, this does not happen. Whenever there are war conditions within a war, there should not be any human casualties in it.  A common man should not die.  Any how in any condition.  If he dies then we say that a genocide is taking place.  Innocent people are being killed.  Today the media publishes very little about Israel. But that doesn’t mean Israel has n’t committed genocide in Gaza.   What is the most terrible genocide is the one carried out by Israel on Gaza.  Even though the media may have covered it less.  What has happened recently is that Iran has dropped cluster bombs on Israel and many buildings in important cities of Israel like Tlaib, have been destroyed. But some people are saying that the bombs used by Iran, cluster bombs, doing so is illegal, it is illegal according to international laws.  And if Iran does this, we will consider it a genocide.  But Iran has used it.  So was Iran using this tactic thinking that I have to kill Israeli civilians as well who are innocent?  Ultimately we will know what controversy is behind this. But what has happened so far ?  First, let them understand.  Look, the first thing is that Iran is more important than us. Israel needs to understand, not Iran, that Israel is being used as a puppet by the USA.  USA developed its market inside Israel.  USA developed it inside Pakistan.  USA developed inside Ukraine.  So today Israel is being used as a puppet.  It is happening like a puppet and the same puppet is now dancing and by dancing it is harming others.  The treaty, that is to say, the Nuclear Band Treaty, was between America and Iran.  But why did Israel jump into the middle?  Because if Iran is not accepting America's demand then it should be made to accept it through Israel and when Israel attacks then whatever Israel is inside it can also be wiped out.  This will not have any direct impact on America. So America attacks in a covert manner. America fights guerilla warfare so that its reality is not exposed to the people and countries.  So let me brief you a little. Where did it start from?  From October 7, 2023, when the Nova Music Festival was going on inside Israel and Hamas fighters reached there. They started firing there in which many Israeli citizens were killed.  Israel retaliated against Hamas because Hamas is a group of the Axis of Resistance and Iran's IRGC supports Hamas. Therefore Israel decided to destroy Hamas because Gaza was above the Strip. Therefore, the people living inside Gaza were also killed there.  There is hunger there, nutrition is spread there but it makes no difference to Israel. Israel simply has to win its war.  In the meanwhile, Iran enters the country and its entry happens in such a manner that Israel is the first one to attack Iran. And that was done because Iran was supporting the military rivals like the Hotez and Hezbollah. And Israel already knew this. Israel attacked Iran and how did it do it?  It was done through Mousasad.  Mossad, which was an intelligence agency, had already deployed missiles inside Iran and Israel had started attacking Iran's nuclear facilities.  Now Iran has also started retaliating against it and has started using cluster bombs in it.  Now let's see what happens next.  We will know what exactly cluster bombs are ?  How does it work?  When has it been used?  Why have Israel and Iran not signed that treaty yet ?  In which a ban can be imposed on the use of cluster bombs. This treaty was signed in 2008.  We will talk about it in great detail.  First look at the condition of the city.  In this you people can see that this building is completely damaged.  Cluster bombs have been used on these. Ok?  Now, Israel had targeted the nuclear facilities in Tehran-Natanz, which were very important for Iran, all the underground facilities there, the nuclear facilities, were targeted there. Well, Israel did not cause much damage to Iran.  Then the conflict between the two remains at the highest level. Now the thing is that in this conflict, the leader of Iran's defense, whom we call Brigadier General Majid Khadani Khadami, was killed in the attack.  That means Mohammad Khazami who was killed in the sorry attack and then what was Khadami made of here ?  The General who is the commander of the IRGC was made a General.  Ok?  So, he died.  Because of this, Iran was completely shattered.  Iran started to feel that Israel has penetrated very deep today.  So there is a need to answer somewhere.  And then Iran's way of responding, in the meantime an incident happens that 40 military aircrafts from all the air force bases that America had built in Qatar, disappear.  I do n't know where he went.  It was being said that when those 40 military aircraft suddenly disappeared from Qatar, it was said that they had left to attack Iran. They have set out to attack Iran.  I don't know where he went.  Now, USA was already trying in its different countries, like Qatar, Israel, Maldives, Bangladesh. It was said in Bangladesh that give us this island. But Bangladesh refused.  Sheikh Hasina was removed.  So what has the USA done?  Pakistan has deployed its military bases everywhere in Afghanistan.  Similarly, it is the same in Qatar and from there, 40 fighter jets suddenly disappeared from there and it was told that they have left from there to attack Iran. Now let us talk about what these cluster bombs are and why are they so dangerous?  How does it work?  We know about this. First of all you guys look at this photograph. Inside this photograph you can see a huge iron container and these small bombs are visible inside it.  It seems like these are not bombs, friend.  It looks as if laddus are kept there. But this is not a laddu.  Yes, if a small child or a woman picks it up thinking it to be a laddu, it will burst.  Actually, what happens is that small bombs are kept inside a big container. These same bombs are then deployed for attack. Well right now we will see that you guys should first understand the mathematics of the bomb that Israel, i.e. Iran, has used on Israel. See what Iran did, they took a big container and placed 20 bombs inside that container. Keep the bombs.  How many?  Keep 20 bombs.   There weren't many. Kept it within that number and took it over that city.  Like I just showed you a photograph of a building that was in a bad state. You look at this building.  If an attack is to be made using a cluster bomb, then this bomb can be dropped approximately 8 km from the ground.  Placed above.  8 Km  Placed on top, there were almost 20 bombs inside this cluster.  8 Km  While keeping it aloft, it was blasted mid-air. And its radius was about 7 to 8 km.  It covered the radius.  Wherever these bombs fell, they started exploding.  It was not even seen whether there was a child, a woman or an innocent person there.  There was no news of this whatsoever. That is why when these bombs attack, the attack is so powerful that every surrounding establishment gets destroyed.  Now this was not a targeted war. Brother, America says that we have always fought a targeted war; we have attacked only those who are guilty and those who are terrorists. But if cluster bombs are used then their radius will be about 7 to 8 km.  It is of and approximately 8 Km.  It blasts from the top and after the blast its bombs scatter.  The special thing about bombs is that some of them explode after hitting any building. Blasts happen.  But there are some bombs which sink into the soil and do not explode.  Decades later, when it explodes, someone or the other dies in it.  This is the biggest problem. So the thing here is that these are not targeted and spread completely within that area in this manner.  Now how can this be released?  You look inside this diagram.  Actually it is a very large iron container.  There is another smaller container inside that container in which we have filled those bombs.  Now, this bomb, that is, this entire cluster, we target it either with a drone or a missile, and after targeting, these bombs go in different directions and spread.  And what will happen wherever they collide ?  There will be a blast.  I hope you guys have understood. But where has it been used now ?  It was first used during the Second World War.  The number we have just told you is only 20.  20 numbers means only 20 bombs are placed in one cluster.  But at the time of the Second World War, around 100 bombs were kept in a cluster. But gradually their number started decreasing and a small cluster started being made and 20 bombs were placed in it.  Recently, that is last year, when there was a conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, there was a boundary dispute regarding this area between Azerbaijan and Armenia, then neither of them negotiated, but what happened was that cluster bombs were used by Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan used it inside Armenia and Armenia used it on Azerbaijan, both of them used cluster bombs on each other.  Now one thing should be clear to you here that making cluster bombs is not against the treaty anywhere.  But using it is against that treaty.  Now see, every year there is a summit which is called Convention and Cluster Munitions. Every year a meeting is held regarding the ban on the cluster bombs that are made.  A convention takes place. Such a meeting took place in 2008.  It happened in 2008.  At that time it was decided that cluster bombs would not be made.  And since 2008, 111 countries have signed it and agreed that yes, we will not make cluster bombs. But Israel and Iran did not sign that treaty of that convention.  did not agree with him and what did he do?  Now recently they have started using cluster bombs.  So whenever a cluster bomb falls, it makes a tremendous impact. Now you guys will see that Canada has signed it.  Mexico has signed but the United States has not signed that convention, that treaty, which deals with cluster bombs because cluster bombs were also used by the United States inside Afghanistan.  Neither India nor Pakistan has signed it. So here you will see that those countries which have rated themselves are those which have very little need to use bombs.  And those who use more bombs like Russia etc., Ukraine etc.  He has never signed it.  Okay, what happened now?  What did Russia do? Cluster bombs used over Ukraine. Later Ukraine confirmed that Russia had used these cluster bombs on us.  So USA said okay we will also give you cluster bombs and those cluster bombs reached inside Ukraine and then they attacked Russia.  So cluster bombs have been used for a long time and what has Iran done recently? Israel has been attacked with cluster bombs. Now how far can this conflict go ?  Let me give you an idea of how far it can go.  Look, this will reach a point where Israel will run out of weapons and Israel will run out of money. Iran has no shortage of money. He will die and be destroyed but will not stop the war.  This war will stop when Israel runs out of money to buy weapons and Israel will say that yes, now we need weapons but we don't have money.  This war can stop only then.  Apart from this there is no chance that the war will stop.  What do you think?  You guys must tell me in the comment section.
