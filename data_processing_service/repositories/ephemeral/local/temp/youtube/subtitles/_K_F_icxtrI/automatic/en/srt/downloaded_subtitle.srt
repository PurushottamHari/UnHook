1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
Today we're diving deep into the future

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,919
of business operations with Hayden, a

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,880
serial entrepreneur who's using AI not

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,280
just as a tool, but as a core operating

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
system for building, scaling, and

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,920
protecting his companies. You'll learn

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,119
how the master prompt method is changing

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,160
the rules, turning AI from a flashy

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,880
assistant into a strategic partner that

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,480
drives real exponential growth. If

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
you're serious about surviving and

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,200
thriving in the AI first era that we're

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,800
entering, you're going to want to watch

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
this all the way through. And if you

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,120
stay till the end, we'll teach you how

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,040
to build your master prompt step by

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,640
step. Let's get into

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,559
it. Welcome to the channel, Hayden.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,480
Thanks for having me, Tuggo. How are you

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,719
spending your your time these days when

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,280
it comes to to AI? Yeah, I work pretty

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,000
long days. um typically wake up around

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,480
4:30 and spend the first 5 hours or so

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
of the day just learning and typically

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,879
playing with AI. I have a several

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,600
businesses so typically over the last

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,320
decade I've probably spent 40 hours a

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,439
week or so learning something, tinkering

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,439
with it and if it works uh attempting to

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,960
systematize it and then teach it to all

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,439
my leadership teams. So when you say

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,720
leadership teams plural um what are the

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,159
different kinds of businesses that

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
you're involved in right now and how?

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,200
So, I have three different holding

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,439
companies. Um, and between those holding

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,240
companies, we've got probably like 30

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,000
active businesses. I'd say twothirds of

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,759
those were acquired. Onethird of those

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,759
were started. Each of those businesses

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
has a CEO. Each of the holding companies

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,079
has a CEO. And the businesses run a

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
really wide gamut. So, we've got one

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,079
holding company that's really a lot of

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
brickandmortar. So, HVAC, plumbing,

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,680
roofing. Um, we've got another holding

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
company that's a lot of digital stuff.

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,119
When you think of what's going on with

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,439
AI right now, your time, I think it's

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,560
safe to say, is is limited and in

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,960
demand. What makes AI worth spending,

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,520
like you said, four, five plus hours per

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,319
day learning, experimenting with, and

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,760
and and uh figuring out I firmly believe

55
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,680
that AI can potentially double to triple

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,879
every single one of my companies per

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,360
year. That's how big I think it is. Um,

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,239
typically leadership teams up until now

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,959
have been setting goals to have like 30

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,560
to 50% year-over-year growth, right?

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,440
That's can be considered sustainable

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,760
growth. And I think some of the scalable

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,040
companies that I mentioned, I think you

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,959
can 10x that today with AI. I mean, it

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
takes a lot of work, don't get me wrong.

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,599
Um, and I think some of the less

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,440
scalable ones, so more of the brick and

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,080
mortar where a lot of the fulfillment is

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,840
done in person, I still think, you know,

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,560
instead of 30 to 50% a year, I think

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,040
probably six to 100% growth per year is

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,360
is doable. Say a little bit about um,

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
Acquire and Empower, which are two of

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
your companies. Um, Acquire is a

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
business that helps people basically

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
become acquisition entrepreneurs,

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,800
typically buying a million dollar a year

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,200
cash line business that's in profit. um

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,959
financing them through SBA loans. Uh and

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,440
then Empower is working more on the

81
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,239
seller side. So we're helping doing exit

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
planning uh for sellers and kind of

83
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
connecting the two. And how many how

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,519
many people have you worked with or

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,599
across how many businesses or

86
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,319
acquisitions have you have you worked

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,239
on?

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,879
Uh a bunch. Uh definitely over hundred.

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,120
Um I think we had like six closes last

90
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,840
quarter.

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,280
Um, and we probably had

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,879
about sort of working with another 50

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
people. And on the seller side, we

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,280
probably talked to thousands of sellers

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,840
off market. When you say the valuation

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,239
drivers,

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,760
um, which of those valuation drivers

98
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,120
does AI affect? All of them. All of

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
them. Every single one. Yeah. Every

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,159
single one. Different ones I would say

101
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,400
have. So you know I said you can get

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,360
like two you know three to 5x growth in

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,680
some areas and maybe 2x growth in

104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,239
others. So I think marketing for example

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,720
you can have massive growth. Um sales

106
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,840
today you on the actual sales side AI

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,639
can help a lot with things like call

108
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,320
reviews, pipeline management, um

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,600
autoresponders. It can make probably a

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,199
manager maybe three times more

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
effective. Right? So a sales manager

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,600
might have 25 to 30 reports. They can

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
remove a lot of the reporting, a lot of

114
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
the that people don't like

115
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
doing, but it can't currently take

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,960
calls, right? So you're still limited by

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,919
someone actually taking the calls. Now

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,160
that might change in the next year or

119
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,160
two, um

120
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,919
operations, things like creating

121
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,240
process, things like all of that is so

122
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,479
much faster. Uh it removes a lot of the

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,120
monotony. Mhm. Um but there's still a

124
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,840
level of training and buy in uh that you

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,840
know takes a lot of work. So what is the

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,600
master prompt method? So basically when

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,840
you prompt you want to be able to give

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,400
the AI as much detailed instruction and

129
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,240
context as possible. If you do a simple

130
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,600
one-s sentence prompt and you've got no

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
other context, the answer you're going

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,280
to get is going to be no better than

133
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,199
really a Google answer in most cases.

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
And so some people do start that way and

135
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,120
they prefer to make turn it into a

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
conversation, right? So do you know do

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
this for me and then it gets back. Okay,

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
now make it this way. Okay, and now make

139
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
it this way. So they kind of look at

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,800
like it's a Google on chatbot. Yeah.

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,800
Right. And then so that's kind of your

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,479
first introductory level. And the second

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
level up after that would be you've

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,240
probably all seen like an Instagram reel

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,240
where someone says like copy this prompt

146
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,120
and it's a super long thing, right?

147
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeah. um and you are my executive coach

148
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,960
and you won't take any from me. And

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,520
it's like then it becomes super mean.

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,919
And so we've all seen that. What the

151
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,039
master prompt is was basically how can I

152
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,199
give full context for in my case for my

153
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,120
business every single time I prompt

154
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,880
without having to write anything. Yeah.

155
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,039
Um and I first thought of this when like

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,360
Chad GPD first came out with memories,

157
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,360
right? The way memories worked was it

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,840
was just, you know, one at a time. You

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,000
had to ask it to remember it, right? And

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,479
eventually after you used it a lot, it

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,080
became really, really useful. But just

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,199
the way it worked, it probably took

163
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,800
like, you know, hundreds of

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,160
conversations to get to that point. And

165
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,680
I found myself always saying, "Remember

166
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,560
this, remember this, remember this."

167
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,400
Right? And then I found then I started

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,240
playing with other tools and I found

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,800
that um Claude basically had these

170
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,160
account preferences uh that let you put

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,560
in effectively like all of the memories.

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,440
So I actually had chatbt export all of

173
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,440
its memories uh and put it into cloud

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,560
and then it it uses that and accesses

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,240
that every time um I ask it anything,

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,440
right? So it now has the full context of

177
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,720
my business. And so I worked on

178
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
developing that out, developing that out

179
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
for each of my companies. Uh and then

180
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,759
sharing it with my leadership teams and

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
showing them how to use it. And this one

182
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
prompt would maybe be like on a Google

183
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
doc 30 pages long, right? And those 30

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
pages are being accessed every single

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
time you type something in. So once you

186
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,680
do that, it's just night and day that

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,440
type of response you get and you just

188
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,960
continually iterate and iterate and it

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,960
just gets better and better. One more

190
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,840
question before we look at uh a couple

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,000
different uh kind of case studies. What

192
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,520
is the impact that it has? Like why why

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,520
does why is it important? Why does it

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,160
matter? What difference does it make to

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,240
have a master prompt? You get more done

196
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
better and faster. Quality of the out of

197
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,080
your work improves drastically. Like

198
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
there's some stats around quality

199
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,759
improving 40%. The productivity, the

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,240
amount of work one person does uh

201
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,000
improves drastically. and you can get it

202
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,039
out faster. So, literally, it's all

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,680
three, right? And that all comes from

204
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
more and better context. More and better

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,479
context and the fact that it's AI. What

206
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,800
would take, you

207
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,960
know, someone two weeks to put together

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,879
everything you need to to really do a

209
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,039
thorough job uh of something now takes,

210
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
you know, under an hour. And so what I

211
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,440
what I find really interesting is and

212
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,639
what will happen is that there will be a

213
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,759
democratization of execution. So and

214
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
it's going to take a different amount of

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,319
time depending on what industry you're

216
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,919
in and how adaptable um the industry is.

217
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,479
Um so like the brick and mortar stuff

218
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
will probably take several years. Um but

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
some of the digital stuff, software,

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399
marketing, um legal finance, that stuff

221
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,880
will probably move much faster because

222
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,440
of this. you can take you can do very

223
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,240
thorough things that typically only very

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,399
large companies have the resources to do

225
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,160
uh in very little time. So sort of

226
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
narrowing the difference or the gap

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
between the small companies and the

228
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,440
large companies. Yeah. Democratization

229
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,519
of execution. Let's get into both some

230
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
real life demos and then we're going to

231
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,839
actually teach you how to build the

232
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,800
first version of your master prompt for

233
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,519
you and your company or organization. So

234
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,519
watch till the

235
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,600
end. All right. So now we've moved to

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,600
the computer and we are looking now at

237
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
your claude account. Say a little bit

238
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,240
about why you have chosen to use cloud

239
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,720
for this. I use claude because it has

240
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,200
this basically setting preference that

241
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
lets you basically put in this. It's

242
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,920
called personal preferences. Um that

243
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
lets you put in everything about your

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
company. So this goes into every single

245
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
prompt. And then the other reason I use

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,600
cloud is that it also has projects and

247
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,640
these projects um for example can when

248
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,880
you go in it has a sources right and so

249
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,040
these sources over here also have

250
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,680
project knowledge and I can share these

251
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,360
projects with other people whenever I

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
make a prompt from within this project

253
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,640
it uses not only what's in the settings

254
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,120
but it also uses everything that's

255
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,560
within this project knowledge and if I

256
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,240
can share this project with other people

257
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,000
so notebook element it's kind of like

258
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,720
this is like notebook LM with a separate

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,200
notebook for everyone. Um, what notebook

260
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,519
Ellen doesn't have is this sort of

261
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,120
preferences thing and and that's your

262
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,720
master prompt basically. Could we see

263
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
that again real quick? Sure. Just to

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
give people a little preview. So this is

265
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
that you said 20 or 30 page doc that has

266
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
all the context about this particular

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,920
business. Yep. So I I share this with

268
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
everyone on the team and I always ask

269
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,800
them to uh just update this part. Right.

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,120
So obviously this is me and this is my

271
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,120
position. I'm the founder. also some

272
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,320
personal stuff, right? Shows what my

273
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,240
strengths are. Also shows what my

274
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,320
weaknesses are. And I also have a how I

275
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,920
want AI to help me. I hope to be able to

276
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,800
use AI and technology to fill in for the

277
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
weakness, which is driving

278
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,240
accountability, keeping everything on

279
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,480
schedule, internal communication, not

280
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
doing things that I don't like doing.

281
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
These are the co key focus areas. Again,

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,600
this is for acquir uh and empower

283
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
together in one. It's not we have

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
separate ones for different businesses.

285
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,200
Then we have like business structure

286
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,880
stuff, which I don't often use. We have

287
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,519
sort of what of our what our products

288
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,959
are. It's like a compendium of knowledge

289
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,760
about this business. Yeah. So, you know

290
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,800
what I used to use and was we had what

291
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,320
was a goo a big Google doc that I just

292
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,680
called our executive um library and I

293
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
just put everything in there. Now, this

294
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,160
is kind of the same, but it's also NI.

295
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
So, yeah. So, it shows our salesunnel

296
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,079
and our conversion metrics, our sales

297
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,760
process, our timing of closes, our

298
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,160
qualification,

299
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,320
um our workshops. This is all stuff on

300
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,920
our team. Who's on the team? What's the

301
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
cost of each team? And this is where

302
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,360
we're going to show people in a minute

303
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
to create for themselves. At least the

304
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
first version. Exactly. Yeah. And some

305
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,880
of the the pieces that matter at the end

306
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,560
are sort of more like so we're going to

307
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,320
show how to do this, but so for example,

308
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,480
131 is something I've used in all of my

309
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,760
businesses. Uh whenever I ask for one,

310
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
I'm asking you to help a decision-making

311
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
framework in which you determine the

312
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
problem, the outcome, and provide three

313
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,440
potential paths and one recommended

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,360
course of action. And then I always ask

315
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,880
it to ask five questions one at a time

316
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,399
um to get what you need to do this and

317
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
answer each question based on what you

318
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,680
know about the business and situation.

319
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
Present your answer and allow me to edit

320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
it or approve it before you proceed to

321
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,120
the next question. It's not just uh

322
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,120
literal factual information about the

323
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
business like you would find in a

324
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
business directory. It's like frameworks

325
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,160
that you use. Yep. Yeah. So all of these

326
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,920
are like we're going to show how what

327
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,440
this actually creates this AI hiring

328
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,920
one. Um so this is one prompt. Uh AI

329
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,040
CMO. We can show that as well. AISP, we

330
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,720
can show that as well. They're sort of

331
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,240
like almost like mini programs that you

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,480
write protocols. Yeah. They're like

333
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,480
little protocols. Um, and like the nice

334
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,480
thing about LLMs is that they are, you

335
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,320
know, you multimodal, so you can take a

336
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
screenshot and put it in. You can, you

337
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
know, take all sorts of stuff and put it

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,040
in. So, a project you mentioned is just

339
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,519
really just a conversational interface

340
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,680
to a set of documents. Exactly. Right.

341
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah. So, it's almost like it's adding

342
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,360
to the master prompt, but just for those

343
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,800
things. So in this project for example,

344
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,800
this is on this is all related to um the

345
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,880
seller funnel and us working with

346
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
sellers and not working with buyers. So

347
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,399
there's no reason for me to put this in

348
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,839
the master prompt that all people on the

349
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,920
buyer side of the business will use.

350
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680
Might even get confusing and pull the

351
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,600
wrong info. Exactly. It's almost like

352
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,839
you want this global context, but then

353
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,480
you actually want silos. Yep. You want

354
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,120
little enclaves of protected information

355
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,680
that aren't shared universally. Yep. And

356
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
how about um the sharability? You

357
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,720
mentioned if you have someone working

358
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
with you on one of these projects, you

359
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
can share it with them. Yep. You can

360
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,160
share chats uh and you can share

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,399
projects. And if you share a project,

362
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,880
can they have their own conversation

363
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,800
with that project? Yep. And do you have

364
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,839
access to that conversation or it's it's

365
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,200
private to them? I believe I do. Um I

366
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,760
don't really use it like that very

367
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,680
often. and chatbt. Just as a point of

368
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,600
comparison, at least on the day we're

369
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
recording this, you can create a

370
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,200
project, but you can't share that

371
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,600
project with anyone, right? Yeah. When I

372
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,959
first looked into chat GPT for these

373
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
options, it was a bunch of different

374
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,040
things that it couldn't do. Um, the

375
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,199
master prompt is another one. Chat GPT

376
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,199
can't do it. Gemini has gems and they

377
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,399
just don't work properly. Mhm. Uh at

378
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,639
least right now as of April 29th at 4:46

379
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,959
p.m.

380
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,440
Uh and uh the only two that are kind of

381
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,760
options for this are are Notebook LM and

382
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,480
Claude. I find that Claude is just a

383
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,040
little bit better for just share general

384
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,480
sharability. Yeah. Um but notebook. All

385
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,959
right. So this was a good introduction

386
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
to how you use Claude. Let's look at a

387
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,480
couple use cases. So what are some

388
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,680
examples of of uh problems you were

389
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,839
trying to solve or things you were

390
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,560
trying to build that were either way

391
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,040
faster or way more effective or

392
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,639
profitable or whatever it is because of

393
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,680
because of the master prompt method in

394
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,959
AI. AI like I said is can democratize

395
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,680
execution meaning even small enterprises

396
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,560
even you know a one-person company can

397
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,079
now take on a process that would be

398
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,279
typically reserved for a company the

399
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,240
size of GM right and so one hiring

400
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,720
practice that um we use in our companies

401
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,000
uh is top grading and top grading is a

402
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,639
lot of work uh you have to you know

403
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,320
obviously the cliche of you know hiring

404
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,079
slow and firing fast definitely exists

405
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,959
but you put in a ton of effort, you have

406
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:18,800
way more interviews. Um, and then you

407
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:20,399
also measure um much more uh regularly.

408
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,199
Do you want to do this without the

409
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,000
master prompt first or I can if you

410
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,839
like. Sure. Yeah. So, yeah, this has no

411
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
no personal preferences. Just kind of a

412
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,519
blank account. Um, so let's say I I just

413
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:38,000
want to say uh uh I want to hire a

414
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,000
marketing director or acquire a

415
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,160
help. So you can see interesting. I have

416
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,079
to go back. It's like, all right, well,

417
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,519
give me context, right? What does

418
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,880
acquire do? What are the key

419
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
responsibilities? What are the specific

420
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
qualifications or experience you're

421
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,279
looking for? So it's basically kind of

422
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,320
like if I have to type all this out, I'm

423
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,480
basically someone's just typing for me,

424
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,320
right? Right. Or, you know, adding some

425
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,240
words in. Okay. Okay. So, if I go to my

426
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:07,279
version here, I just say do AI hiring

427
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,440
for marketing director. And AI hiring is

428
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,480
like a trigger word that activates that

429
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,360
protocol. Yeah. So, that's one of the

430
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,279
words I had in my in my master. And when

431
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,920
you say acquirer, that one word, it

432
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,680
knows everything about acquir.

433
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,839
Yeah. So, first is ask me questions.

434
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,759
This is what I have it programmed to do

435
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,440
and it answers its own question. So what

436
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,399
are the primary responsibilities of this

437
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720
market? By the way, we don't have a

438
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
marketing director require. Um, so it's

439
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
interesting that it kind of understands

440
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,079
this. Um, so leading overall marketing

441
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,600
strategy, generate leads for both of our

442
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,480
programs, managing our multi-

443
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
channelannel marketing approach. It

444
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,560
knows it's emails, a AI agent texting

445
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,480
and paid ads, overseeing content

446
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,079
creation for nurturing our list,

447
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
directing both buyer side and seller

448
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,440
side marketing efforts, managing

449
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
marketing team that includes blah blah

450
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,120
blah. So I mean, this is perfect, so

451
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,440
I'll just say yes. Yeah.

452
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,399
All

453
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,920
right. Right. So now it's just going to

454
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,680
create a job descript. This is the other

455
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,000
thing I really like about Claude is it

456
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,199
has these things called artifacts.

457
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,679
Um and you'll see it'll it'll create

458
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,319
multiple in a second. But notice how

459
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,160
over here it's doing exactly what I

460
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,000
mentioned. So it's got the

461
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,360
responsibility, it's got the market, the

462
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,439
metric to measure, and it's got our

463
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,640
quarterly target for each one of these.

464
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
And again, we don't actually have this

465
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
position. So it's making some

466
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,280
assumptions here. Mh. Uh, it's got the A

467
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,600
player versus B player performance

468
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,880
across all of these. Um, it's got the

469
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,080
month one outcomes, the month two

470
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,919
outcomes, the month three and beyond

471
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,160
outcomes. It's got what the ideal

472
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,760
background. When you've done this in the

473
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,400
past, you've gone through this in great

474
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,559
detail and really verified it. Yeah. I

475
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,960
mean, we we can go through it that

476
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,480
typically the things that will that I

477
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,880
will always look at will be like

478
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,640
specifically this and like the targets

479
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,320
make sure they're accurate. This would

480
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
have taken our HR director a bunch of

481
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,320
time to create. like how much time would

482
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
you estimate? So each of it's creating a

483
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,640
lot of artifacts right now. So this is

484
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,360
probably the hardest one. Um this would

485
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,919
probably take the better part of a week

486
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,760
simply because you have to have meetings

487
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,520
with in this case whoever the direct

488
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
report or the direct manager would be

489
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,600
which would probably be like the CEO.

490
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,640
Mhm. Right. Because we don't have like a

491
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,360
a VP there. That's multiple meetings and

492
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,360
multiple reviews and then also just at

493
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,120
least a couple days of work putting it

494
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,559
putting it together. So okay that that's

495
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,640
one thing. Um this is right here is the

496
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,039
recruitment materials. So it creates

497
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,880
again this is part of the prompt in AI

498
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,720
hiring. It creates uh a screening

499
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,840
interview uh criteria. So obviously

500
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,280
we're going to put out um job ads and we

501
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,600
don't want to have to interview every

502
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,679
single person. So it asks for a cover

503
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,000
letter. It defines what should be in

504
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,559
that cover letter and it based on it

505
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,720
being able to screen and score so that

506
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,440
when we actually do interviews uh we

507
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,240
don't we only do it with people above 20

508
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,480
out of 30 to advance. Uh and so this

509
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,679
here are some of the sample questions.

510
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,640
Uh here's if we email to our list about

511
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,960
the role. Uh here is a job posting for

512
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,919
external sites. Um, and then here is if

513
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,840
people pass that screening interview,

514
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
here's what the working interviews would

515
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,960
be. Mhm. So, in a position like this,

516
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
we'd probably have a couple working

517
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,840
interviews with a couple people. Um, so

518
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,799
we'd have one here, this just what it's

519
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,840
recommending. Marketing funnel

520
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,520
optimization. Another is email marketing

521
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,160
revitalization. A third is new product

522
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,320
launch marketing plan. Uh, it also gives

523
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,400
we always do homework for managers or

524
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,679
above. Um, and so basically giving us a

525
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,120
couple options for homework to give

526
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,039
them. This always took me a ton of time

527
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,880
to think about like good homework for a

528
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,039
role and they're always really good.

529
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,960
Um, and then again, this is like top

530
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,080
grading would do all of these things.

531
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,000
Most people in a company of like 30 to

532
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,640
40 people like Acquir, you wouldn't do

533
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,360
this. You'd just be like, "Yep, looks

534
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,520
like he can type on a keyboard." I mean,

535
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,039
give him a chance. Yeah. It's like for a

536
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,200
company already like a massive

537
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,120
multinational already doing top grading.

538
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,919
This is like okay more efficiency faster

539
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,640
time but for I mean I'm thinking of my

540
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,440
company which is much even much smaller

541
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,200
five people we would simply not do

542
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,440
anything like this. We would be like oh

543
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,520
we know a guy who does this so and so

544
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,880
and just invite him invite him on and

545
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,960
like what's the difference? So, so the

546
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,159
difference might

547
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:32,080
be that you know

548
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:35,440
a let's say 50% more people in this

549
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,640
method are a players. Mhm. Right. Then

550
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,400
in your method. So you take two

551
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,559
companies, two ident two identical

552
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,559
companies going at the same motion, you

553
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,360
maybe need to make if you're growing

554
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,400
maybe year one you make three hires. Um

555
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,159
maybe one of yours works out and two of

556
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,360
mine work out. That's right. Huge. But

557
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,720
that's huge. And now next year because

558
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
two of mine work out I need to make six

559
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,120
hires and you need to make three hires

560
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,280
and now four of mine work out and one of

561
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,919
your like that just it's a divergence.

562
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,480
It's huge because companies really it is

563
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,640
about people right nowadays because you

564
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,520
can do this like this in my opinion will

565
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,840
become common place again it'll depend

566
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,520
on the industry and how much people use

567
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,200
AI. It'll probably take many years

568
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
before every small business is doing it

569
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,559
but there's no reason in my opinion why

570
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,000
should people shouldn't do this right

571
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,360
now. Everybody watching this video

572
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,360
should do this. This was an awesome

573
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,280
example. Um, let's look at a different

574
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,919
one. Let's look at kind of the opposite

575
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,840
like something operations related in all

576
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,840
my

577
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,159
companies. Another thing that is I'd say

578
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,840
we do at a smaller size than most

579
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,000
companies because it's I think it's

580
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,799
really important to get consistency

581
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,280
across the board is fulfillment engines.

582
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,280
Um, but they're basically flowcharts of

583
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,760
process. Uh and so this is a process

584
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,400
that we use uh and in one of our

585
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,919
products basically to um you know

586
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,679
someone pays money they get onboarded

587
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,000
and we start searching for a business

588
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,039
for them and it kind of starts here at

589
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,080
us receiving money and it ends this just

590
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,440
this part ends at getting uh an LOI a

591
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,280
letter of intent a letter of intent

592
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,799
counter signed by a seller right and so

593
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,640
there's kind of two mark two paths to it

594
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,200
there's on market and offmarket we do

595
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,440
both um at the same time effectively

596
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,280
like this is a good onboarding tool for

597
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,720
people because and it's also just good a

598
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,799
good tool for your onboarding of

599
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,000
customers as well as your employees and

600
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,320
then it's also like each of these

601
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,080
actually links to process right and SOPs

602
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,960
and checklists right and I think

603
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,720
everyone knows they should do this but

604
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
it's a pain in the ass you have to be

605
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,120
like a a certain kind of weird to enjoy

606
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,559
it um which I'm not and my daughter is

607
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,320
she loves it but check this out so I'm

608
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,000
just going to take a screenshot any chat

609
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,240
here and just to test this out. I'm

610
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,799
going to say what is this? Let me paste

611
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,840
it in the

612
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,600
screenshot. Okay, it says this appears

613
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,159
to be a process flow diagram for the A+

614
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,080
program onboarding and deal sourcing

615
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,400
workflow.

616
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,799
Um, it's describing it to me accurately.

617
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,200
Mhm. So, I'm just going to say do AI SOP

618
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,640
where we stop which is another protocol.

619
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,600
Yeah, another protocol that we define in

620
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,679
the master prob. This one is like two

621
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,360
paragraphs, right?

622
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,280
which starts with whenever I say AOS

623
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,039
SOP.

624
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,520
And so what it's now doing is it's

625
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,200
taking every single step here and it's

626
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,679
turning it's basically creating the SOP

627
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,960
for it. Uh now you can go even further

628
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,840
and you can actually have if you have

629
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,559
Claude make this flowchart for you uh

630
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,200
and then have it do it. Um I personally

631
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,799
prefer when we're teaching companies, I

632
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,559
personally prefer to actually do this

633
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,120
manually just so people really think

634
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,200
about it. Um because I think that piece

635
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,799
does

636
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,360
require some brain power. What's the

637
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,960
impact of being able to document a

638
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,159
process like this? What what difference

639
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,000
does it make? Uh accountability. Mhm.

640
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,280
It's probably the biggest difference.

641
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,400
Accountability for for employees to to

642
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,039
follow the process. To follow the

643
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,240
process. Yeah. Uh there's never, you

644
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,240
know, if if something doesn't get done,

645
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,960
there's only a few reasons why that

646
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,080
happens, right? um either they didn't

647
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,080
know it needed to be done um they didn't

648
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,400
know how to do it or they weren't bought

649
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,080
in to do it right and so this completely

650
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,039
eliminates

651
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,640
the first two right you know it needs to

652
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,640
be done and you know how to do it I

653
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,240
guess and on the buy in it helps a lot

654
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,640
it's much easier to understand what

655
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,279
you're helping achieve and what your

656
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,600
role is in it and so actually we have

657
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,760
these things called clarity boards so if

658
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,559
you go back to like this other one that

659
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,080
I did here, right? Um, by the way, I

660
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,919
always have at least three chats going

661
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,600
on at once while I wait for AI. Yeah.

662
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,200
Um, so in this one right here, like what

663
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,360
we do is we have like a clarity board

664
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,600
which has all of these on separate um,

665
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,520
it's like a one-stop shop for employees

666
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,520
and it also has a fulfillment engine for

667
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,840
that employment employee just what they

668
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,480
need to do, right? It's almost like an

669
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,760
employee handbook or a man a manual in a

670
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,200
way. That's also included. The actual

671
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,640
employee handbook's included in it as

672
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,240
well. M um do you ever find that the the

673
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,200
people in your companies following this,

674
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,520
do they ever ask the AI for help, if

675
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,559
they get stuck on one of the steps or

676
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,720
somewhere in the process? They

677
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,360
absolutely can. I just want to like

678
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,679
stress that that each one this is just

679
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,360
it's a pain to do. They're very

680
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,880
accurate. Like they're actually when I

681
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,919
reviewed these, they were more accurate

682
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,760
than the first reviews I did when they

683
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,279
were actually made because for Acquir,

684
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,000
we made these maybe a year ago, a little

685
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,240
under a year ago. And it took months to

686
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,960
do and it was a lot of work for a lot of

687
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,200
people, right? Um because and then you

688
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,440
have someone who has to own the SOP.

689
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,919
This right here was probably the

690
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,440
replacement of at least three months of

691
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,200
work. Mhm. Now there's still part of the

692
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,679
challenge now is like how do you get buy

693
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,600
in? Because sometimes when someone has

694
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,799
spent months working on it like they

695
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,200
just need to get buy in because

696
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,120
it was so much work. uh and now so

697
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,080
sometimes you can see that people care a

698
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,080
little bit less because the effort

699
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,640
wasn't there. SOPs and documentation is

700
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,480
so interesting because it's it's

701
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,240
important for companies of all sizes.

702
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,840
Like I can I can imagine a massive

703
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,000
corporation needing to do that but also

704
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,440
in our tiny team of five. The only way

705
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
we can run our company with so few

706
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,360
people is with really good

707
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,520
documentation. It's like every person in

708
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,840
our team on our team has five hats that

709
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,919
they wear and they to switch between

710
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,240
those roles they need they need, you

711
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,960
know, notes and documentation. So that's

712
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,440
that's a the solution you showed is one

713
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,000
that encompasses a super wide variety of

714
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,559
companies and organizations. Yep. And

715
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,799
it's just one example, right? This if

716
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,799
you recall in my preference when I said

717
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,400
what my weaknesses were, it was exactly

718
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,880
this. And I said, I want AI to help me

719
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,360
with this. And so that's how I use it.

720
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,000
But I think as people use it, they're

721
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,480
going to find even more use cases again

722
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,480
just with an LLM. Yeah. Going back and

723
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,720
forth. And the the thing that I really

724
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,760
encourage is whenever so it's a couple

725
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,919
things. Um when you're using Claude, I

726
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,080
always encourage you to ask Claude to

727
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,320
ask you questions. And then if you have

728
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,919
a master prompt, I always encourage like

729
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,520
answer your own question based on what

730
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
you know and then stop and let me look

731
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,120
at it just to save you time. So you

732
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,880
don't actually have to type anything. Um

733
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,799
and then you also are able to see what

734
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,559
does Claude not actually understand

735
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,840
correctly, right? And then you can go

736
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,720
back and change the master prompt.

737
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,120
Interesting. Right. So that's part of

738
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,559
the iterative process. say a little bit

739
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,559
about how this is impacting the

740
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,240
structure of teams or the size of teams

741
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,120
or the roles on those teams. I think

742
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,000
there will be no director layer at all.

743
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,720
Um and I think the manager layer will

744
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,039
probably expand like so typically you

745
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,200
kind of had like this a 50 person

746
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:52,720
company would have sort of seven um sort

747
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,480
of front-facing technicians, right? Um

748
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,880
for every manager. And so you'd have

749
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,120
seven people to seven managers to like,

750
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,120
you know, let's call it one CEO. And so

751
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,320
that's a 50 person structure. And when

752
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,320
you think about that like from a from a

753
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,640
headcount ratio perspective, um it's not

754
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,600
bad, right? You've got effectively 42

755
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,120
people um being paid that are revenue

756
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,000
generating and you have eight people

757
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,600
that are supporting.

758
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,440
However, getting to that stage

759
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,039
is a ton of work. And so there's there's

760
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
this stage everyone some people call it

761
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,120
the valley of death some people call it

762
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,320
the swamp right and it's the stage where

763
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,159
you're kind of you're still too small to

764
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,919
be able to afford to like hire that

765
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,159
layer of management. And so the only

766
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,240
real way to overcome it is you either

767
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,000
take a risk and do a hire with with all

768
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,480
your profit or stop paying yourself or

769
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,880
you work way more hours or you do both.

770
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,000
And so to get to that 50 of efficiency

771
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,559
most of the companies that we're buying

772
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,559
actually have about 25 30 employees and

773
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,960
it becomes super inefficient. So you end

774
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,200
up having maybe 12 or 13 sort of front

775
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,720
level techs and then you end up having

776
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,960
like

777
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
five managers and like two people that

778
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,760
wear like four hats and so it ends up

779
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
being really inefficient and maybe in a

780
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,720
in your previous company or in your

781
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,240
current company you have something like

782
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,720
that where I c I mean I certainly have

783
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,799
and so what I think will happen is you

784
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
will just have the front level people

785
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,320
right just the people actually doing the

786
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,559
workney

787
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,559
Yeah. And depending on the business,

788
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,159
plumbers, HBAC, like you need actual

789
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,600
people to go to someone's house, right?

790
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,440
You need cars. You're limited to the

791
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,240
number of, you know, hours they have in

792
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,080
a day. Yeah. Um, but what you sell, you

793
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
sell an info product, right? And

794
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,720
actually, you sell an info product

795
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,480
without sales. So, actually, it could

796
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,279
be, you could have almost infinite

797
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,960
amount of revenue coming in with very,

798
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,600
very few employees, right? Yeah.

799
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,840
Um and so that's why we have we have two

800
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,440
portfolios. One portfolio is like will

801
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,840
not be replaced by technology but will

802
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,440
not scale at like 5x a year and then we

803
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,919
have the other portfolio that's like

804
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,360
scale like crazy. Um but you're going to

805
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,720
be competing with other people who are

806
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,640
scaling like crazy. Interesting. So

807
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,320
yeah, long answer to your question. I

808
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,799
think you're going to have far larger

809
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,480
companies with far fewer employees. AI

810
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,919
will be all your director layer will be

811
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,720
your CEO layer. Um it will just be

812
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,279
basically owner and then front level

813
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,799
people. So if you're still watching at

814
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,559
this point, you want to do this, you

815
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,960
understand the context, you understand

816
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,480
the impact, you understand the

817
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,159
implications, I really want you to try

818
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,640
this for yourself. So, we are going to

819
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,399
move over to the flip chart and teach

820
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:48,120
you how to come up with at least the V1

821
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,200
of your master prompt. Ready? Let's do

822
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,120
it. So, I'm going to assume you work in

823
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,200
an organization of some kind like a

824
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,919
company. You might be a manager, a

825
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,919
director, a VP, a CEO, or even the

826
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,440
owner. How would someone working in an

827
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,039
organization or company like that get

828
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,559
started with the master prompt method?

829
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,200
Yeah. So, I would first probably just

830
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,039
create a Google doc. Um, and I'd start

831
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,640
creating some sections. And so I think

832
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,559
the first section would be personal

833
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,880
info. Pardon my writing. I was a doctor

834
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,799
in a former life.

835
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,600
So outside of your name, um, this is

836
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,840
going to be like what's your

837
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,919
role? What company do you work in? How

838
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,919
do you want to use AI? What are your

839
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,480
strengths? What are your weaknesses?

840
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,240
That will help AI kind of personalize

841
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,480
and give it the context that you need.

842
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,039
Okay. Next, obviously we need some

843
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,039
company info.

844
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,760
Um so here is like when was the company

845
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,960
established

846
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,399
how many employees does it

847
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,200
have who if it's part of the personal

848
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,279
like who do you report to and then some

849
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,320
important questions about like what

850
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,880
markets do they serve who is their ideal

851
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,440
customer what products and services do

852
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,120
they have so each of these questions and

853
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,480
we can go over them but each of these

854
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,120
questions I actually recommend if you

855
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,880
don't know the answer actually just talk

856
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,200
to AI right and so if you don't know who

857
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,519
they serve perfectly just literally you

858
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,200
know type a message like hey help me

859
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,240
determine who our ideal client u profile

860
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,679
is totally right and take their answer

861
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,960
like put it in a separate artifact take

862
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,480
their answer copy and paste it in your

863
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,519
Google Google doc when you're happy with

864
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,080
it um so yeah that's the that's the who

865
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,880
right there's also like the what which

866
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,279
is like what do you do right? Um what is

867
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,200
the outcome that you're effectively

868
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,080
trying to give to your customer? And

869
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,919
again, you can if if you don't know

870
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,440
exactly how to phrase that, it's

871
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,200
probably good to actually chat back and

872
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,519
forth. Use AI as a thought partner.

873
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,679
Third is that is the how, right? So, how

874
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,679
do you do it and how is that different

875
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,760
from your competitors? So, then I would

876
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,440
say like market information. Who are

877
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,399
your competitors is a good one. Um what

878
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,559
do they do? I especially if you're in

879
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,559
marketing, that's super useful. For each

880
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,279
of these sections, is there like a

881
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,000
minimal length you would look for, like

882
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,200
a word count or what level of detail?

883
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,440
Honestly, a paragraph is probably fine.

884
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,840
Um, any level of detail is better than

885
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,320
none. Yeah. Uh, and what you may find is

886
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,080
as you work back and forth with Claude

887
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,559
or Notebook LM or whatever, you may

888
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,840
decide that based on the results, you

889
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,600
may decide, you know, that wasn't

890
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,519
perfect. And so, I'm going to go and add

891
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,880
a little bit more info. So, I would

892
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,640
actually just recommend everything I

893
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,640
talked about, maybe write like one to

894
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,679
two sentences. Outside of market, this

895
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,159
is going to be more than five. Uh, we

896
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,840
have uh people or team, who's on the

897
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,039
team, right? If you're the owner of a

898
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,880
small business, I would actually just

899
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,399
talk about, you know, who reports to

900
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,559
you, who reports to each of those

901
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,640
people. If you want to bring finance

902
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,960
into this and you can make financial

903
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,399
decisions, uh, you can put that stuff

904
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,679
in. Just keep in mind if you're going to

905
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,960
share this with people on your team, you

906
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,480
might there may be some stuff you don't

907
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,279
want to share. I like to put team plus

908
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,919
APIs. So for each person, what is their

909
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,960
one number, which is super important.

910
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,879
Um, again, if you don't know, then ask

911
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,320
Claude, hey, you know, this person does

912
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,720
this. I need to figure out what would be

913
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,159
the best KPI for them. And then products

914
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,440
and services. So, this I'll

915
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,079
um talk about all of the products,

916
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,440
including potentially planned products,

917
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,760
what do they cost, what are their

918
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,079
features, what are the benefits, and

919
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,520
like that's a great start, those five

920
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,960
things. Um the the last thing that

921
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,240
especially for someone who's a business

922
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,800
owner or someone in a leadership

923
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,839
position I would say would be like

924
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,919
culture and this

925
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:50,000
is quite

926
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:53,280
important because culture which would

927
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,879
include core values right it's a kind of

928
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,400
like a who is on the bus right um

929
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,359
mission

930
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,599
all of that stuff will kind of define

931
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,000
everything you do in each of these and

932
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,560
like the AIS SAP for example our core

933
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,160
values require our serve right

934
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,760
systematic excellence which you probably

935
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,079
see a lot and what I'm talking about um

936
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,160
is the S and so it knows whenever we say

937
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,160
we want to create an SOP it knows to do

938
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,680
that when we do an email to the list it

939
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,079
knows to do that when we create content

940
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,520
it knows to mention our core values and

941
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,480
ultimately that's kind of what creates

942
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,400
and positions you in your market and

943
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,079
people who share those values kind of

944
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,160
orient towards

945
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,599
become true fans. So culture is really

946
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,839
important. So those things it's so

947
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,800
important. I'm just going to put a

948
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,480
little little subheader here.

949
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,480
So I would say core

950
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,680
values if you don't know them. Cloud's

951
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,240
really good at helping you identify

952
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,480
them.

953
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,480
Mission um be hag is a nice one. It's

954
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,320
like your big hairy audacious goal,

955
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,920
right? And then the the final thing

956
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,400
which is maybe outside of the scope of

957
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,359
this video um would be the actual kind

958
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,960
of prompts, right? And and a lot of that

959
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:12,480
can be tailored to your business, right?

960
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,560
So the AI SOP, the um AI hiring, right?

961
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,240
And as you and again, you just figure

962
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,599
that out as you keep on going. Maybe you

963
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,440
read a book and you really like some

964
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,800
concept and you think to yourself, how

965
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,040
can I implement this into the master

966
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,480
prompt? Oh, fascinating. Oh, that's such

967
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,680
a good So, it's like sometimes you're

968
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,920
reading a book, you're like, I wish I

969
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,160
could just like install this book like a

970
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,119
software program into my business and

971
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,480
now you can. Yeah. Yeah. I played with

972
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,079
some stuff too about like, you know,

973
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,640
there's like what would Jesus do, right?

974
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,599
Or what would this ex business person

975
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,520
do, right? It's so easy to do with AI,

976
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,920
right? Just prompt it because it has all

977
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,640
the information about the Yeah. Right.

978
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,040
What about like goals or strategy? Does

979
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,359
that figure into here as well? For sure.

980
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,720
Um, the only reason I wouldn't put this

981
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,920
in in your first master prompt is as you

982
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,560
use AI, any goals and strategy you have

983
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,880
today are most likely going to change

984
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,440
massively. Um, as you kind of explore

985
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,560
and realize what AI is capable of. Uh, I

986
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,640
know for ourselves, you know, we used to

987
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,000
I mean, we used to plan three years in

988
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,079
advance. M I've gone down to 6 months in

989
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,640
advance just because I've noticed that

990
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,359
technology shifts um just make new

991
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,880
things possible. Mhm. Um I know at the

992
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,400
beginning of I was looking at like my

993
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,040
2024 goals that we shared with our

994
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,599
leadership team uh and it had like the

995
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,320
2-year goals and so like three year

996
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:41,520
goals 2024 25 26 I was looking at the

997
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:44,480
2026 number and today like in 2020 25

998
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,400
our 2026 number is like four times what

999
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,160
it was back then mostly because of AI

1000
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,240
mostly all because of AI like it's only

1001
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,320
in the last year last six months really

1002
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,079
that that changed mass massively. Wow.

1003
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,480
Okay, that's a great piece of advice.

1004
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,920
Don't don't put in free AI

1005
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,320
plans that you expect to come to

1006
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,960
fruition. I'd love if you give this a

1007
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,200
try. If you could share with us in the

1008
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,200
comments below what you found, how did

1009
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,599
it go? What were the wins? What were the

1010
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,599
obstacles? We'll do our best to respond

1011
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,680
to those comments and guide you further.

1012
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,119
But otherwise, uh, thanks for being a

1013
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,119
guest on the channel and teaching us

1014
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,040
what you know. Hayden, I would also love

1015
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,480
to know in the comments if you are able

1016
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,040
to use this in something that's not

1017
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,040
business. What kind of master prompt did

1018
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,800
you create and like what kind of uh

1019
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,400
sections did you put in it? That'd be

1020
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,560
really interesting to me. I hope that

1021
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,200
was interesting. I hope it was valuable

1022
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,119
and most of all, I hope it was helpful.

1023
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,280
You can find out much more about the

1024
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,599
master prompt method and the new program

1025
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,560
that we're teaching called Second Brain

1026
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,560
Enterprise at the link below. Thanks for

1027
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,560
watching and I'll see you next time.
