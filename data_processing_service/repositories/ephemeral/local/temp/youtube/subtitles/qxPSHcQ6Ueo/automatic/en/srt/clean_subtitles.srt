Hello Friends.  Friends, Iran has taken a big step and used cluster bombs for the first time in this war against Israel. And let me tell you, there are many countries in the world that have conventions related to cluster bombs. Signed it and said that we will not use it. Because on humanitarian grounds it is said to be a crime. Because this is a huge threat not just for today but also for the future generations to come. I will tell you in the video.  But you can see this news Iran fires missiles with cluster bombs as conflict with Israel enters day eight.  So on the eighth day it has entered the entire war and 10 major developments have taken place in it. I will discuss it with you in detail, the biggest of which is this development related to the cluster bomb.  So let's get started. But before that, friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC for 2026, for next year or especially for 2027, our long term batch has started from today. You have to simply use this code. If you have any kind of doubt related to Ankit Live and Batch, you can simply call on this number.  Our team is sitting.  All your doubts will be resolved. Let's get started.  First let us see what exactly happened?  It is being told that there was a large scale aerial assault on Israel yesterday.  In this, Iran fired a ballistic missile armed with a cluster ammunition warhead.  I will tell you about it further.  But this missile is a cluster bomb, one of those bombs is being told that in the Besheba area in Southern Israel, the Besheba town, again you will see a little about this, I am talking to you, on the southern side of the map of Israel, you can see the Gaza Strip, here, if you look on the right side of this Gaza Strip, just to its right, you will find Warehouse, there it is being told that this is a medical centre, Surka Medical Centre, now see, there is a lot of discussion on this as well, if during the war you attack a hospital or a medical centre because it is not usually expected.  There is a war going on, it's military to military.  If you attack civilian areas and especially hospitals, it is considered a major crime.  And especially if you look at Gaza, there were many allegations against Israel that Israel had bombed many hospitals in Gaza. Now Israel said that they have built underground tunnels beneath it. Whatever the region is.  So what has happened here is that the Surokha Medical Centre, you can see in the pictures, its condition has become like this. These cluster bombs were used here.  And if you look at this, 80 to 240 people have been injured. This is what is being told.  And this was the first known use of cluster munitions by Iran in this particular confrontation.  Well, now the question here is what are these cluster muons?  It's a simple thing.  These are types of weapons that scatter dozens to 100s of small explosives.  Meaning if Iran is launching a munition.  If a rocket is launching a bomb, then through it it can launch anywhere from a dozen to 100s of munitions.   I mean, it can launch small explosives like bombs. You will understand it better from this diagram. This is a munition.  Now, if you look inside this munition, you will find many small explosives planted here.  So when it is about to reach its target, it opens at a particular height and releases many explosives in the entire area.  are you understand?   In fact, if you see, it was said by Israel yesterday that when this missile was being dropped.  This ammunition was being dropped over Israel.  So 7 km. It got split at the height of .  Meaning 7 km from the ground.  It got split. And then after that it is being told that there are about 20 such submunitions which are 5 km.  Meaning five sorry 8 km.  Whatever was within the radius of , spread out.  This is being told here. And because of this, see, the biggest problem is that these small minis that you are seeing, it is not necessary that all the minis will blast.  There are many such immunizations which remain on the ground for many years. You don't even get to know about it, because when a situation is happening during war, who pays attention to what?   They are just running away to save their lives.  So because of this it is being said that long term civilian casualties may occur. Maybe after 10, 20, 40 years some civilian might be going there.  Some digging is going on. Something was happening and then suddenly it became pressurized.  If there is too much weight on it then it can blast.  In fact, you might have noticed that many times news comes that the landmines etc. that were laid during the World War 2 are similar in nature, their impact remains even today, there is a fear that this will pose a huge threat to the future generations and because of this, if you see, there is a Convention on Cluster Mines of 2008 which bans the development of such weapons and their use for stock piling and more than 110 countries have signed this convention and ratified that we will not use it.  In fact, Iran, Israel, US, Russia have also not signed it.  Neither Iran nor Israel have signed it.  Now what was Israel's reaction?  Israel condemned this strike.  Said that this is a war crime.  This is state sponsored terrorism.   In a way, especially the way the hospital has been attacked.  And this is a violation of international law.  And we will give a very strong response to this.  And this is actually what happened.  If you watch throughout last night, again Israel has carried out massive attacks on Tehran's military and nuclear sites.  It is being told here that many nuclear research and development headquarters, including the Nuclear Research and Development Headquarters inside Iran, have also been attacked.  A total of more than 60 fighter jets attacked 120 targets inside Iran.  And it is being said that these sites were being built for many years and were the industrial centers of gravity of the Iranian Ministry of Defense.  In fact, Span Headquarters, it was founded in 2011 and it was also hit.   The Israeli Defense Forces have said that this was, in a way, the center of Iran's nuclear weapons program. So he attacked him.  So, this is one development related to cluster missile.  The second development here is that, in a way, Israel also launched a heavy attack on Iran.  Then thirdly, if you look at the development here, a very important thing has come up because a lot of discussion is going on about whether Donald Trump will attack.  Meaning, will the US enter this entire war directly ?  It is indirectly known to all these people.  The whole world knows.  Even if the US denies it now.  But the question here is whether the US will enter this entire war or not?  Finally, a statement has come from Donald Trump regarding this that a decision will be taken in two weeks.  It means that in a way you can understand, look what happens in geopolitics, things have to be found out, now two weeks' time has been given through talks, which means it is obvious that Iran has two weeks' time at this time, now if they decide in two weeks, then it is possible that it may attack in 4 days, or 5 days, but most likely, as per the current situation, two weeks' time has been given to Iran.  In a way, Don Trump is saying that I am not looking to fight but if it is a choice between fighting and having a nuclear weapon, then I will fight here.  Meaning, I do not want Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.  So, here it is a big development that Iran has got two weeks' time. Apart from this, the Intel Chief of IRGC has also been targeted here.  Actually, this is very important news because I am talking about last Friday.  It is Friday today.  If you look at last Friday, Israel had attacked many targets. So it is being said there that the Chief of IRGC, Intel Chief has also been killed in this attack.  Which becomes big news in itself. This has not been confirmed by Aldo Iran. But if you look at Israel's strategy till now, it has been to destroy Iran's capability of retaliatory operations. Destroy their nuclear infrastructure so that they cannot retaliate.  So this is an important thing.  Next development here, you will see that Israel has now slowly started saying that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, should be killed.  Especially yesterday, Soko Medical Center was attacked through cluster mining.  So, the Defense Minister of Israel has clearly said this regarding this.  This is perhaps one of the most direct threats yet made by Israeli officials.  Because till now no important Israeli official or minister was saying that we want to accept the supreme leader of Iran.  Such news was coming unofficially. But see, now it becomes important because Ali Khamani is not only for Iran, but in the Muslim majority country, many people there believe in him, especially the Shiite Muslims. So what is happening here is that the US officials are saying that Donald Trump had in a way vetoed it. Israel knew the location of Ali Khamenei and wanted to believe him, but Donald Trump said that no, there is no such plan right now. We are not going to kill him right now because it could cause a huge disruption. So let's see what development takes place regarding this. But next, another development that has happened here, if you look inside Qatar, there is a very important strategic base of the US.  You will see this in Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar. Some images have emerged from there.  It is being said that the US fighter jets were present in the earlier image and suddenly the fighter jets here have disappeared. Where has he gone?  Is the US fully preparing for war?  Or those fighter jets have been sent to the carrier, are being positioned on the aircraft carrier or somewhere else.  So here also continuous efforts are going on through satellites to find out which country is trying to do what.  Next, another important development, look at what happened, when Surco Medical Centre was attacked, Nitin Yadav reached there as a gesture.  But one such statement of his came due to which he had to face a lot of backlash.  That was, actually he was trying to show that look, my son is getting married twice, meaning the second time it will happen is when I am postponing my son's wedding, so everyone is struggling with it.  Meaning he was addressing the whole of Israel and telling them that we are all in pain right now.  But here we have to stay together.  But in a way, a lot of backlash was also seen from the people because people were saying that you are worried about your son's marriage. Here the entire country is at war and has been at war for a long time. So in a way, you will get to see this also.  Next look here now there seems to be a hope that maybe the diplomatic talks may start in Geneva.  What is happening in Geneva is that Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Arachi is scheduled to have a meeting with the leaders of the European Union and the UK and it is possible that a window may be open that in the next two weeks, as I told you, Don Trump has given two weeks' time, in a way, efforts are being made to find a diplomatic solution in two weeks, efforts are being made to stop escalation, let's see what happens regarding this as well, but now another interesting thing that has happened here is that when Israel is attacking, there are many nuclear sites etc. inside Iran, it is informing the people there that look, you should leave that place and run away. Otherwise it can be quite dangerous.  So what is the problem now?  There is an internet blackout inside Iran. So where this is being said, especially if you look at the nations, cities in Iran, the civilians there were warned by Israel to evacuate the industrial zones because we are going to attack. Now it is not known whether the message reached people or not because there is an internet blackout there. Did people vacate it?  How many people were killed?  So all these things will also be seen and ultimately the last development here is that many speculations are being made that whether this Iran Israel war is going to spread more rapidly in the entire Middle East, whether Iran's proxies will also enter now because they have not entered yet and this is quite surprising I was thinking of making a video on this that what has happened, otherwise earlier whenever Iran used to attack Israel, the rest of Iran's proxies also used to get defeated here, Hezbollah got defeated, whatever they are, you will not get to see this this time, let's see I hope that through this video you must have got whatever current update was there and before leaving a very interesting question can you tell which of the following countries is both nuclear power and not a signatory to the convention on cluster munitions, I just told you about the convention that which is that country which is also a nuclear power and has not signed the convention on cluster munitions  have done it.  You all know its right answer.   You will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.  You can get its correct answer from Telegram.
