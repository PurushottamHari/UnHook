00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hello Friends.  Friends, Iran has

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,279
taken a big step and

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,960
used cluster bombs for the first time in this war against Israel.

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,960
And let me tell you, there are

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,800
many countries in the world that have

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
conventions related to cluster bombs.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,039
Signed it and said that we will not use it.

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,880
Because

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
on humanitarian grounds it is said to be a crime.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,519
Because this is a huge threat not just for today but also for the

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,519
future generations to come.

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,960
I will

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,679
tell you in the video.  But you can see this

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,399
news Iran fires missiles with cluster

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,040
bombs as conflict with Israel enters

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,280
day eight.  So on the eighth day it has entered the

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,800
entire war and 10 major developments have taken place in it.

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,879
I will discuss it with you in detail, the

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,960
biggest of which is this development

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,239
related to the cluster bomb.  So let's get started.

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,920
But before that, friends, let me

22
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,920
tell you all that those of you who are

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,239
preparing for UPSC for 2026,

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,559
for next year or especially

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
for 2027, our long term batch has started from today.

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,920
You have to simply

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,079
use this code. If you

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,079
have any kind of doubt related to Ankit Live and Batch,

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
you can simply call on this number.  Our team is

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,080
sitting.  All your doubts will be resolved.

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's get started.  First let us

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,320
see what exactly happened?  It is being told

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,360
that there was a large scale aerial

34
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,240
assault on Israel yesterday.  In this, Iran

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,640
fired a ballistic missile armed with a

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,200
cluster ammunition warhead.  I will

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
tell you about it further.  But this missile

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
is a cluster bomb, one of those bombs is being

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,720
told that in the Besheba area in Southern Israel, the

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,960
Besheba town,

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,799
again you will see a little about this, I am talking to you,

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,720

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,960
on the southern side of the map of Israel, you can see the Gaza Strip,

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,799
here, if you look on the right side of this Gaza Strip,

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,360
just to its right,

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
you will find Warehouse,

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,439
there it is being told that this is a medical

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,920
centre, Surka Medical Centre, now see, there is a

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,560
lot of discussion on this as well, if during the war

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,399
you attack a hospital or a medical

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
centre because it is

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,079
not usually expected.  There is a war going on, it's

53
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,840
military to military.  If you

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,000

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
attack civilian areas and especially hospitals, it is

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
considered a major crime.  And especially

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,399
if you look at Gaza, there were

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,399
many allegations against Israel that Israel had bombed many hospitals in Gaza.

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,920

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
Now Israel said that

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,239
they have built underground tunnels beneath it.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,319
Whatever the region is.  So what has happened here is that the

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,400
Surokha Medical Centre, you

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,879
can see in the pictures, its condition has become like this.

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,040
These cluster bombs were

66
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,160
used here.  And if you

67
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,920
look at this, 80 to 240 people have been injured.

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,720
This is what is being told.  And this was the

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,680
first known use of cluster munitions by

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,280
Iran in this particular confrontation.  Well,

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,920
now the question here is

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,120
what are these cluster muons?  It's a simple

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,560
thing.  These are types of weapons that scatter

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,000
dozens to 100s of small explosives.  Meaning

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,400
if Iran is launching a munition.  If

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,680
a rocket is launching a bomb, then

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,720
through it it

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,319
can launch anywhere from a dozen to 100s of munitions.   I

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,239
mean, it

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,840
can launch small explosives like bombs.

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,480
You will understand it better from this diagram.

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,760
This is a munition.  Now,

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
if you look inside this munition, you will find

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,239
many small explosives

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,080
planted here.  So when it is about to

86
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,640
reach its target,

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,840
it opens at a particular height

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,239
and releases many explosives

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,480
in the entire area.  are you understand?   In

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,040
fact, if you see, it was

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,360
said by Israel yesterday that when this missile was being

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,680
dropped.  This ammunition was being

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,560
dropped over Israel.  So 7 km.

94
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,040
It got split at the height of .  Meaning

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
7 km from the ground.  It got split.

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
And then after that it is being told that there are about

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,799
20 such submunitions which are 5 km.  Meaning

98
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,040
five sorry 8 km.  Whatever was within the radius of ,

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
spread out.  This is being told here.

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,280
And because of this, see, the biggest problem is

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,120
that these small minis that

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
you are seeing, it is not necessary that all the

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,159
minis will blast.  There are many such

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,239
immunizations which remain on the ground for many years.

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,560
You don't even get to know about it,

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
because when a situation is happening during war,

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
who pays attention to what?   They are

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
just running away to save their lives.  So

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,879
because of this it is being said that long

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,360
term civilian casualties may occur.

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,040
Maybe after 10, 20, 40 years some civilian might be

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,879
going there.  Some digging is going on.

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Something was happening and then suddenly it became pressurized.  If there is too

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,199
much weight on it then it

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
can blast.  In fact, you might have noticed that

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,600
many times news comes that the

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,000
landmines etc. that were laid during the World War 2 are

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
similar in nature,

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,320
their impact remains even today, there is a fear that this will pose

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,560
a huge threat to the future generations

121
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,479
and because of this, if you see, there is

122
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,680
a Convention on Cluster

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,919
Mines of 2008 which bans the

124
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,479
development of such weapons and their

125
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,479
use for stock piling and

126
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,320
more than 110 countries have signed this convention

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,160
and ratified that we will

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,479
not use it.  In fact, Iran,

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,000
Israel, US, Russia have also

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,840
not signed it.  Neither Iran nor Israel have

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
signed it.  Now

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
what was Israel's reaction?  Israel

133
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
condemned this strike.  Said that this

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,000
is a war crime.  This is state sponsored terrorism.   In

135
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,520
a way, especially the

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,479
way the hospital has been attacked.  And this

137
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,800
is a violation of international law.  And we will

138
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,199
give a very strong response to this.  And this is actually what

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,360
happened.  If you watch throughout last night, again

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,520
Israel has carried out massive attacks on Tehran's military and

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,400
nuclear sites.  It is being

142
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,400
told here

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
that many nuclear research and

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,360
development headquarters, including the

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Nuclear Research and Development

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,240
Headquarters inside Iran, have also been attacked.  A

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,960
total of more than 60 fighter

148
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,039
jets attacked 120 targets

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,039
inside Iran.  And it is being

150
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,199
said that these sites were being built for many years and

151
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,280
were the industrial centers of gravity

152
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
of the Iranian Ministry of Defense.  In fact,

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,320
Span Headquarters, it was founded

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,080
in 2011 and it was also hit.   The

155
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,240
Israeli Defense Forces have

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
said that this was, in a way, the center of Iran's nuclear weapons

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,120
program.

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
So he attacked him.  So, this is one

159
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,520
development related to cluster missile.  The

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,560
second development here is

161
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,199
that, in a way, Israel also launched a

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,800
heavy attack on Iran.  Then thirdly,

163
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
if you look at the development here, a very

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,160
important thing has come up because a lot of

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
discussion is going on about whether

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,120
Donald Trump will attack.  Meaning, will the

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,039
US enter this entire war directly

168
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,400
?  It is indirectly known to all these people.  The

169
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,560
whole world knows.  Even

170
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,720
if the US denies it now.  But the question here is

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,880
whether the US will enter this entire war

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
or not?  Finally, a

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,039
statement has come from Donald Trump regarding this that a

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
decision will be taken in two weeks.  It means that in a

175
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,120
way you can understand, look what happens in geopolitics,

176
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
things have to be found out,

177
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
now two weeks' time has been given through talks, which

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
means it is obvious that

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,120
Iran has two weeks' time at this time, now if they decide in two weeks, then it is

180
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,600
possible that it may attack

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,520
in 4 days, or 5 days,

182
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,759
but most likely, as per the current situation,

183
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
two weeks' time has been given to Iran.  In

184
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,080
a way, Don Trump is saying

185
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,240
that I am not looking to fight but if it is

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,560
a choice between fighting and

187
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,360
having a nuclear weapon, then I will

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,680
fight here.  Meaning, I do not want Iran to acquire

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,840
nuclear weapons.  So, here it is a

190
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,680
big development that Iran has

191
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,319
got two weeks' time.

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Apart from this, the Intel Chief of IRGC has also been

193
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
targeted here.  Actually,

194
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440
this is very important news because

195
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,120
I am talking about last Friday.  It

196
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,199
is Friday today.  If you look at last Friday,

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,360
Israel had attacked many targets.

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,479
So it is being said there

199
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,479
that the Chief of IRGC, Intel Chief has

200
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,240
also been killed in this attack.  Which

201
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,479
becomes big news in itself.

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,800
This has not been confirmed by Aldo Iran.

203
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,039
But

204
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,759
if you look at Israel's strategy till now, it has been to

205
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,680

206
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
destroy Iran's capability of retaliatory operations.

207
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
Destroy their nuclear infrastructure

208
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,880
so that they cannot retaliate.  So this

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
is an important thing.  Next

210
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,039
development here, you will see that

211
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,199
Israel has now slowly started saying that

212
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,160
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, should be

213
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,960
killed.  Especially yesterday,

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,280
Soko Medical Center was attacked

215
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,960
through cluster mining.  So, the

216
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,199
Defense Minister of Israel has

217
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,160
clearly said this regarding this.  This is perhaps one of the

218
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,240
most direct threats yet made

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,919
by Israeli officials.  Because till now no

220
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,039
important Israeli official or

221
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,960
minister was saying that we

222
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,440

223
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,120
want to accept the supreme leader of Iran.  Such news was coming unofficially.

224
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,560
But see, now it becomes

225
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,199
important because

226
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,520
Ali Khamani is not only for Iran, but in the

227
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,759
Muslim majority country,

228
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,160
many people there

229
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,160
believe in him, especially the Shiite Muslims.

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,000
So what is happening here is that the US

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,759
officials are saying that Donald

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,560
Trump had in a way vetoed it.

233
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,959
Israel knew the location of Ali Khamenei and

234
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,760
wanted to believe him, but Donald Trump

235
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,680
said that no, there is no such plan right now.

236
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
We are not going to kill him right now because it could

237
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,440
cause a huge disruption.

238
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
So let's see what development takes place regarding this.

239
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,279
But next, another development that has happened here,

240
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,279
if you look inside Qatar, there is

241
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,320
a very important

242
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,880
strategic base of the US.  You will

243
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,959
see this in Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar.

244
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,080
Some images have emerged from there.  It is being said

245
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,279
that the US fighter jets were present in the earlier image

246
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,120
and suddenly the

247
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,200
fighter jets here have disappeared.

248
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
Where has he gone?  Is the US

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,959
fully preparing for war?  Or

250
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,640
those fighter jets have been

251
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
sent to the carrier, are being positioned on the aircraft carrier or

252
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,480
somewhere else.  So here also

253
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
continuous

254
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,320
efforts are going on through satellites to find out which country is

255
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,640
trying to do what.  Next, another

256
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,120
important development, look at what happened, when

257
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,600
Surco Medical Centre was attacked,

258
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
Nitin Yadav reached there

259
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,560
as a gesture.  But one such statement of his

260
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,040
came due to which he had to face a lot of backlash.  That was,

261
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,640
actually he was

262
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,120
trying to show that look, my

263
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,120
son is getting married twice, meaning the second time it will

264
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,600
happen is when I am postponing my son's wedding,

265
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,839
so everyone is

266
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
struggling with it.  Meaning he was addressing the whole of Israel and

267
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
telling them that we are all

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
in pain right now.  But here we have to

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,040
stay together.  But in a way,

270
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,640
a lot of backlash was also seen from the people because

271
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,959
people were saying that you are worried about your son's marriage.

272
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
Here the entire country is at war

273
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,200
and has been at war for a long time.

274
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
So in a way, you will

275
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
get to see this also.  Next look here now there

276
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,120
seems to be a hope that maybe the

277
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
diplomatic talks may start

278
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,360
in Geneva.  What is happening in Geneva is that

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,240
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas

280
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,640
Arachi is scheduled to have a meeting

281
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,519
with the leaders of the European Union and the UK

282
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,200
and it is possible that a window may be open that

283
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,959
in the next two weeks, as I told you,

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
Don Trump has given two weeks' time, in a

285
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,240
way, efforts are being made to

286
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
find a diplomatic solution in two weeks,

287
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,760

288
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360
efforts are being made to stop escalation, let's see

289
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
what happens regarding this as well, but now another

290
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,519
interesting thing that has happened here is that

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,279
when Israel is attacking, there are

292
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,120
many nuclear sites etc. inside Iran, it is

293
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,360
informing the people there that

294
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,920
look, you should leave that place and run away.

295
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,760
Otherwise it can be quite dangerous.  So

296
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,920
what is the problem now?  There is an internet blackout inside Iran.

297
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
So where this is being said,

298
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,959
especially if you look at the

299
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,640
nations, cities in Iran, the

300
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
civilians there were warned by

301
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,040
Israel to

302
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
evacuate the industrial zones because we are going to attack.

303
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,399
Now it is not known

304
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320

305
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,079
whether the message reached people or not because there is an internet blackout there.

306
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
Did people vacate it?  How many

307
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,000
people were killed?  So all these things will also be seen

308
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,560
and ultimately the last

309
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
development here is that many speculations are being made

310
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,120
that whether this Iran Israel

311
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,120
war is going to spread more rapidly in the entire Middle East,

312
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
whether Iran's

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,720
proxies will also enter now

314
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
because they have not entered yet and

315
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,240
this is quite surprising I was thinking of

316
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
making a video on this that what has happened, otherwise

317
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
earlier whenever Iran used to attack

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
Israel, the rest of Iran's

319
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
proxies also used to get defeated here,

320
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,160
Hezbollah got defeated, whatever they are,

321
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,760
you will not get to see this this time, let's see I

322
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
hope that through this video

323
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,200
you must have got whatever current update was there and

324
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,040
before leaving a very interesting

325
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,079
question can you tell which of the

326
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,480
following countries is both nuclear power

327
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,160
and not a signatory to the convention on

328
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
cluster munitions, I just told you about the

329
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,560
convention that which is that country

330
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,880
which is also a nuclear power and has

331
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,640
not signed the convention on cluster munitions  have

332
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,079
done it.  You all know its right answer.   You
