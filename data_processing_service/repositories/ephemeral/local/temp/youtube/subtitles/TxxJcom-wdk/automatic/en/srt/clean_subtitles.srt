Friends, just a while ago a big news has come that Iran has attacked Israel for the first time with a hypersonic missile. You can see this news Iran Supreme Leader's Big Warning after Launching Hypersonic Missile at Israel.  And look here it seems quite likely that the US too will jump into this war very soon. Because many statements, Donald Trump's sudden departure from G7 and the kind of warning he gave after that, indicate a lot here. We will know about this in detail in the video.  You will get to know a lot.  Let's move on. First of all, see what is the reason behind this crisis?  You all know that the escalation between Iran and Israel has increased significantly. Especially when Israel started Operation Rising Line here and said that we do not want Iran to have nuclear weapons, and because of this, many of its nuclear facilities, military installations, radar systems and many other things were attacked.  In view of this, Iran also launched Operation Honest Promise 3 here and said that this is a large scale retaliatory missile campaign against Israel.  And at the same time, their military, IRGC, has also claimed that it is just the beginning of a multiphase operation and somewhere we want to be able to deter the Israeli aggression in a way. So what has happened here now?  Look, basically, it was declared today by their supreme leader Khamenei and what he said, you can see, he publicly stated that the battle begins and we will show no mercy to Zionist criminals. I will tell you later what he said exactly. But the important thing is that this is the first time in the last few decades that Iran is endorsing a direct military confrontation at the highest level. Because whatever was happening till now, many times missiles were launched, drones were launched.  So here, some statements used to come from those who became President and Prime Minister.  But you will see this at the highest level from Iran's side and somewhere it shows that the war here is going to escalate very rapidly. What infact happened?  First of all let me tell you that on social media, US President Donald Trump issued a kind of threat and said that you have to do unconditional surrender.  Meaning, Iran was told that it will have to surrender without any conditions.  And after that if you see, the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he issued a warning on Twitter on x and look there it said the battle begins, Ali returns to Khyber.  So basically what is this?  Let me show you a little bit about this. If you see the tweet, this image was shared along with it.  So basically the basic translation of what Khamani has tweeted is: In the name of Namai the battle begins Ali returns to Khyber with his Zulfikar.  So the reference of this statement is basically that the first Imam of Shia Islam had conquested just the town of Khabar in the 17th century and he tweeted by referring to that and along with that, he posted an image in which a person is entering a castle-like gate holding a sword and you can see fireballs raining in the sky like this. You can see this here.  So in a way this is a direct threat now.  It seems that Iran is not going to back down from here either.  So this tweet was made by Khaini, shortly after that you can see here early this morning he made another tweet and said we must give a strong response to the terrorist giant regime.  So he is basically referring to Israel.  And we will show thenest no mercy.  We will not show any mercy and will attack with all we have. And then you can see what happens, here it is revealed that Fateh One hypersonic missile has been used over Israel. Is this Fateh Van?  This is Iran 's first non-operational hypersonic missile developed by the IRGC's Aerospace Force and what is its speed? Because a hypersonic missile is one whose speed is more than 5 Mach.  So its speed is said to be around 13 to 15 Mach meaning 18,000 km.  But the speed can be up to R. Its range is 1400 km. is around.  And what becomes important in a hypersonic missile is that after its launch, its maneuverability is quite good. Meaning, if Israel feels that the target is going to be hit here.  So Iran can change its direction from far away. So because of this it becomes very difficult to predict it and especially to detect the defense systems that Israel has, be it Iron Dome or David Slings. And why does this significance remain?  Because hypersonic weapons in a way reduce the reaction time and your entire defense system fails to intercept it.  And it can strike with high precision.  This means that your precision can strike any strategic site, be it military command centre, air bases or nuclear facilities.  And it is also important because this is the first time that Iran has, probably, become the first country in the Middle East to publicly use a hypersonic missile during combat.  So now the question is, did this cause any damage?  Look, according to the initial reports that have come out, it is being said that these missiles were targeted and it is not that there was a single hypersonic missile. Several hypersonic and ballistic missiles were launched simultaneously.  The launches were carried out in two waves and they were aiming at the entire Tel Avi area in Central Israel as well. And because of this, it is being said that some military logistics depots have suffered some damage as some fire- like things were also seen there.  No civilian casualties have been reported so far.  But it is also being said by Israel that our Iron Dome and David's Sling have intercepted many missiles.  But the reports that are coming out say that some missiles with advanced payloads breached the Israeli defense and hit inside Israel. Well, considering this, it is obvious that Israel would also respond and Israel deployed its F35 jets and carried out a counter-strike on the Iranian facilities.  They struck at their missile sites. Apart from this, cyber attacks were launched so that Iran's missile tracking radar and early warning system could be targeted, and if you look inside Israel, emergency preparedness has been started, shelters have been opened, Israeli military reserves have been mobilized in Talvi and Haifa, many of their intelligence units, commando forces, all of them have now been deployed. Now the question is what is America's role in this?  Because the US President has issued a blunt warning and said that Iran should unconditionally surrender, unconditionally surrender, we know where the Khanis are.  So in a way Donald Trump is threatening that we know where Khamenei is and we can attack him whenever we want.  An in fact report also came out where it was being said that Israel wanted Khamenei to be eliminated.  It should be blown up by a missile.  But somewhere, Donald Trump backed off.  He said that no, this can cause a lot of harm. So, in a way, they have appealed to all Americans that wherever you are from Iran, or Tehran, you should evacuate immediately.  Do not travel to the Middle East right now and the US Embassy in Jerusalem has been sealed on a temporary basis due to the security threat. Well now the question is how much possibility is there of US involvement ?  Because if you look at the military posture, it is at the highest level.  The US Navy has deployed its aircraft carrier group USS Eisenhower inside the Persian Gulf.  The Patriot missile barrier batteries, which become the third system, have also been deployed by the Gulf States in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. And if, let's assume, by mistake, Iran attacks the US forces or any asset of the US in any way, then it is being said here that counter air strikes will be carried out and the US will launch cyber operations on Iranian missiles so that Iran's communication infrastructure is disabled.  Apart from this, the Iranian ship present here will also be prevented from entering the State of Hormones.  And here the US can say that we have carried out this attack in self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Or alternatively the US can also say what if Iran launches missiles against US assets. Even before that, suppose the US launches an attack on Iran.  So in that case, it can also be said that we knew that Iran was going to attack us. That is why we have launched attack on Iran.  So there can be a lot of possibilities here.  But in the end another question arises that ultimately what is the objective of every country of these three countries ?  If we talk about Iran, then Iran basically wants to assert its power against Western hegemony.  Apart from this, he wants to deter the Israeli and US strikes here.  He wants to mobilize the nationalist support that he has at home within Iran. Khamenei is the supreme leader of Iran and here he is showing his missile strength, for example, Fateh One which he just launched, he is also trying to give a signal of unity. Israel, on the other hand, is basically saying that we do not want to see Iran having nuclear weapons at any cost, at any cost.  Because if that happens, it is an existential threat to us and apart from this, it has also drawn a red line, the air defence system in Iran has also been tested in a way to see how strong it is and apart from this, somewhere Israel wants the US to join this war as soon as possible so that it gets more strength and in a way, an attempt is being made to change the map of the Middle East a little bit. This kind of talk is going on.  An attempt is being made to change the regime inside Iran. America on the other side.  Donald Trump basically wants Israel's security to be maintained.  That will be in the interest of the US.  There should not be a full blown war.  Somewhere or the other the disruption of oil could be quite severe. Apart from this, Trump would also not want that the manpower, basically the forces, the army personnel, should not be deployed on the ground.  Because he is repeatedly talking about withdrawal. So if this happens, then there will be a contradiction in their words that you are bringing more American people from above to the Middle East. So, they don’t want it.  So Trump wants to somehow get some deal done here. Things should stop.  So let's see what ultimately happens regarding this.  But I hope that you have understood the latest update related to all this and before leaving, can you tell me what is a very interesting question?
