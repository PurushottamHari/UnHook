1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,199
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,680
Hello Friends.  Friends, just a while

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,239
ago a big news has come that Iran has

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,239
attacked Israel for the first time with a hypersonic missile.

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,559
You can see this news

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,360
Iran Supreme Leader's Big Warning after

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,520
Launching Hypersonic Missile at Israel.  And

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
look here it seems quite likely

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920
that the US too will jump into this war very soon.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
Because many statements,

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,399
Donald Trump's sudden departure from G7 and

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,239
the kind of warning he gave after that,

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,000
indicate a lot here.

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,840
We will know about this in detail in the video.  You will

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
get to know a lot.  Let's move on.

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,359
First of all, see

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
what is the reason behind this crisis?  You all

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760
know that the escalation between Iran and Israel has

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
increased significantly.

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,960
Especially when Israel

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,200
started Operation Rising Line here and said that

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
we do not want Iran to have

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,680
nuclear weapons, and because of this,

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
many of its nuclear facilities, military

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
installations, radar systems and many other things were

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,040
attacked.  In view of this, Iran also

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,600
launched Operation Honest Promise 3 here and said that this is a large scale

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,840
retaliatory missile campaign against

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,240
Israel.  And at the same time, their military,

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,040
IRGC, has also claimed that it is

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,960
just the beginning of a multiphase operation and

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,280
somewhere we want to be able to

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,680
deter the Israeli aggression in a way.

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,079
So what has happened here now?  Look,

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,399
basically, it was declared today by their supreme leader Khamenei

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,920
and

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,119
what he said, you can see, he

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,920
publicly stated that the battle begins and we will

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
show no mercy to Zionist criminals.

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,040
I will tell you later what he said exactly.

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,920
But the important thing is

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,759
that this is the first time in the last few decades that

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,840
Iran is endorsing a

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,920
direct military confrontation at the highest level.

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Because whatever was happening till now, many

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
times missiles were launched, drones were

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
launched.  So here,

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,920

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,400
some statements used to come from those who became President and Prime Minister.  But

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,080
you will see this at the highest level from Iran's side

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
and somewhere it

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,480
shows that the war here is going to

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,160
escalate very rapidly.

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
What infact happened?  First of all let me tell you that on social media,

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
US President

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Donald Trump issued a kind of threat

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,560
and said that you have to do unconditional

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,599
surrender.  Meaning, Iran was told that it will have to surrender without any

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,840
conditions.  And

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,160
after that if you see, the Iranian

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,800
he issued a warning on Twitter

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
on x and look there it said the battle

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
begins, Ali returns to Khyber.  So basically

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,440
what is this?  Let me show you a little bit about this.

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,319
If you see the tweet,

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,120
this image was shared along with it.  So basically the

81
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,000
basic translation of what Khamani has tweeted

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,879
is: In the name of Namai the

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,200
battle begins Ali returns to Khyber with his

84
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,080
Zulfikar.  So the

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,720
reference of this statement is basically that the first Imam of

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,599
Shia Islam had conquested

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,000
just the town of Khabar in the 17th

88
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,159
century and he

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,640
tweeted by referring to that and along with that, he posted an image in which a person is

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,120

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,599

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,840
entering a castle-like gate holding a sword and

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,599
you can see fireballs raining in the sky like this.

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680

95
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,599
You can see this here.  So in a way

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
this is a direct threat now.  It seems that

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,159
Iran is not going to back down from here either.  So

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,239
this tweet was made by Khaini,

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,319
shortly after that you can see here

100
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,720
early this morning he made another tweet

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,040
and said we must give a strong response

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,879
to the terrorist giant regime.  So he is

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,560
basically referring to Israel.  And

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,360
we will show thenest no mercy.  We will

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,400
not show any mercy and will

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,239
attack with all we have.

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,120
And then you can see what happens,

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,840
here it is revealed that

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,000
Fateh One hypersonic missile has been used over Israel.

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,959
Is this Fateh Van?  This is Iran

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,600
's first non-operational hypersonic missile

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199

113
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
developed by the IRGC's Aerospace Force and what is its speed?

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
Because a hypersonic missile is one

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,000
whose speed is more than 5 Mach.  So

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,919
its speed is said to be around 13 to 15

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,080
Mach meaning 18,000 km.  But the speed can be up to R.

118
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,240
Its range is 1400 km.

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,639
is around.  And what becomes important

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,320
in a hypersonic missile is that after its launch, its

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,040

122
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,280
maneuverability is quite good.

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,600
Meaning, if Israel feels that the

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,600
target is going to be hit here.  So Iran

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,000
can change its direction from far away.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,040
So because of this it becomes

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,040

128
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440

129
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,600

130
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,360
very difficult to predict it and especially to detect the defense systems that Israel has, be it Iron Dome or David Slings.

131
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,759
And why does this significance

132
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
remain?  Because hypersonic weapons in a

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
way reduce the reaction time

134
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,360
and your entire defense

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,919
system fails to

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,800
intercept it.  And it

137
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,720
can strike with high precision.  This means that

138
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,639

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,360

140
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
your precision

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
can strike any strategic site, be it military command centre, air bases or nuclear facilities.  And it is

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,919
also important because this is the first time that

143
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,240
Iran has, probably, become the first country in the

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,639
Middle East to publicly

145
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,520
use a hypersonic missile

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,360
during combat.  So now the question is, did this cause

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,280
any damage?  Look,

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,039

149
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
according to the initial reports that have come out, it is being said that these

150
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
missiles were targeted and it is not that there was

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,120
a single hypersonic missile.

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,680
Several hypersonic and ballistic missiles were

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,080
launched simultaneously.  The launches were carried out in two waves and

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,479
they were aiming at the

155
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,320
entire Tel Avi area in Central Israel as well. And

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,880
because of this, it is being said that some

157
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,120
military logistics depots have

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,199
suffered some damage as some fire-

159
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
like things were also seen there.  No

160
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,280
civilian casualties have been

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,919
reported so far.  But it is also being said by

162
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,440
Israel that our Iron Dome and

163
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,360
David's Sling have

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,199
intercepted many missiles.  But the

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,440
reports that are coming out say

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,160
that some missiles with advanced payloads

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,479
breached the Israeli defense

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
and hit inside Israel.

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,479
Well, considering this, it

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,600
is obvious that Israel would also respond and Israel

171
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,680
deployed its F35 jets

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,919
and carried out a counter-strike on the Iranian

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,000
facilities.  They struck at their missile sites.

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,400
Apart from this,

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,160
cyber attacks were launched so that

176
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Iran's missile tracking radar and

177
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
early warning system

178
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
could be targeted, and

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,680
if you look inside Israel,

180
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,160
emergency preparedness has been started,

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,919
shelters have been opened,

182
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
Israeli military reserves have been

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,160
mobilized in Talvi and Haifa, many of their

184
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,400
intelligence units, commando forces,

185
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,319
all of them have now been deployed.

186
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
Now the question is

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,400
what is America's role in this?  Because the

188
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,479
US President has

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,919
issued a blunt warning and said that Iran

190
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,240
should unconditionally surrender, unconditionally surrender,

191
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
we know where the Khanis are.  So in a way

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,639
Donald Trump is threatening that we

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,319
know where Khamenei is and we

194
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,919
can attack him whenever we want.  An in fact report

195
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,800
also came out where it was being said that

196
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,039
Israel wanted Khamenei to be eliminated.  It should be

197
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,960
blown up by a missile.  But

198
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,120
somewhere, Donald Trump backed off.  He

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,440
said that no, this can cause a lot of harm.

200
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,680
So, in a way, they have appealed

201
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,160
to all Americans that wherever you are from Iran, or

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Tehran, you should evacuate immediately.  Do

203
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
not travel to the Middle East right now

204
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,680
and the US Embassy in Jerusalem has been

205
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,840
sealed on a

206
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
temporary basis due to the security threat.

207
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,759
Well now the question is

208
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
how much possibility is there of US involvement

209
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
?  Because if you look at the military posture, it is

210
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,280
at the highest level.  The US

211
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
Navy has deployed its

212
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,000
aircraft carrier group USS

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,080
Eisenhower inside the Persian Gulf.  The

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,720
Patriot missile barrier

215
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,280
batteries, which become the third system, have

216
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,599
also been deployed by the Gulf States in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

217
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,000
And if, let's assume,

218
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,800
by mistake, Iran attacks the

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,120
US forces or any

220
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,360
asset of the US in any way, then it is being said here

221
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,440
that counter air strikes will be carried out and the US will

222
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,919

223
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,840
launch cyber operations on Iranian missiles

224
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,680
so that Iran's communication infrastructure is

225
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,320
disabled.  Apart from this, the

226
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,880
Iranian ship present here will

227
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,519
also be prevented from entering the State of Hormones.  And here the

228
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,080
US can say that we have carried out this attack in

229
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,959
self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter.

230
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,360
Or alternatively the

231
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,839
US can also say what if Iran

232
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,680
launches missiles against US assets.

233
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,480
Even before that, suppose the US launches an

234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,040
attack on Iran.  So in that case, it

235
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,200
can also be said that we knew

236
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,040
that Iran was going to attack us.

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
That is why we have launched

238
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,880
attack on Iran.  So there can be a lot of possibilities

239
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,959
here.  But in the end

240
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,800
another question arises that ultimately

241
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,360
what is the objective of every country of these three countries

242
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,000
?  If we talk about Iran, then Iran

243
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,800
basically wants to assert its power

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
against Western hegemony.  Apart from this,

245
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,360
he wants to deter the Israeli and US strikes here.  He wants to mobilize the nationalist

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,519
support that he has at home within Iran.

248
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680

249
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
Khamenei is the supreme leader of Iran and here he is showing his

250
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,600
missile strength, for example, Fateh One which

251
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,600
he just launched, he is

252
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,200
also trying to give a signal of unity.

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
Israel, on the other hand, is

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,480
basically saying that we do

255
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,880

256
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,880
not want to see Iran having nuclear weapons at any cost, at any cost.  Because if that

257
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,120
happens, it is an existential threat to us

258
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,519
and apart from this, it has also drawn a red line, the

259
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,360
air defence system in Iran has

260
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
also been tested in a way to see

261
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,279
how strong it is and apart from this,

262
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
somewhere Israel wants the US to join

263
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,240
this war as soon as possible so that it

264
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,480
gets more strength and in a way, an attempt is being made to

265
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,720
change the map of the Middle East a little bit.

266
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,560
This kind of talk is

267
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,640
going on.  An attempt is being made to change the regime inside Iran.

268
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,640

269
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
America on the other side.  Donald Trump basically

270
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
wants Israel's security to be

271
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,079
maintained.  That will be in the interest of the US.  There should

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,079
not be a full blown war.  Somewhere or the other the

273
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,240
disruption of oil could be quite severe.

274
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,880
Apart from this, Trump would also

275
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,959
not want that the manpower, basically the

276
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,399
forces, the army personnel, should

277
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,920
not be deployed on the ground.  Because he is

278
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
repeatedly talking about withdrawal.

279
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,760
So if this happens, then there will be a contradiction in their words

280
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
that you are

281
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,600
bringing more American people from above to the Middle East.

282
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,760
So, they don’t want it.  So Trump wants

283
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920
to somehow get some deal done here.

284
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,519
Things should stop.  So let's see

285
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,040
what ultimately happens regarding this.  But I hope

286
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
that you have understood the latest update related to all this

287
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
and before leaving,

288
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,920

289
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
can you tell me what is a very interesting question?  Which of the

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,640
following Indian projects is associated

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
with hypersonic missile development?

292
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
You have to tell out of these three and

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
you all know its right answer.  You
