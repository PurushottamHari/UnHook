2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
India has now surpassed Japan to become

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,639
the world's fourth fourth largest

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,120
economy in the world. It is now worth

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:19,920
more than $4 trillion. Japan has

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:22,640
[Music]

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,359
Hi everybody. India just hit the $4

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,439
trillion GDP mark. India is poised to

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,560
become the world's fourth fourth fourth

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,560
fourth largest economy in the world.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,560
Modi

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,960
guarantee

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,280
guarantee guarantee. We've raced past

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
the United Kingdom. We've beaten Japan

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,000
and we are now the world's fourth

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,000
largest

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:56,480
economic. So the Indian economic miracle

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,480
is here, right? No, no, no. Guys, come

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,440
on. It's okay to be happy with $4

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,600
trillion, but do you realize India looks

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
nothing like Japan, UK, or

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,360
France, and don't get me wrong, it is a

23
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
milestone. But here's the thing about

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,920
milestones. Sometimes they are signs of

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,240
progress, and sometimes they are just

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,680
tombstones with better lighting. Because

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,159
behind the $4 trillion flex is a silent

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,880
creeping danger that has already crushed

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,439
countries like Malaysia, Brazil, South

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,000
Africa and Thailand. And I am not saying

31
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,960
this. The World Bank itself is saying

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,759
this. This trap is called the middle

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,840
income

34
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,759
trap. In India, in Brazil, there's a lot

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
of optimism that countries will move

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,799
from middle income to high income. In

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,159
the real world, that's not happened. It

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,680
means that we'll be a middle- inome

39
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
country and then our growth will begin

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,000
to falter unless we're able to increase

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
the sources of demand. We It means in

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,759
short we will not be South Korea. We

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,200
will not be China. We will be Brazil. We

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,040
will be South Africa. We will be a

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,640
middle- inome country with large numbers

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,520
of people in poverty. It's a meager

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,760
$2,900 per year. Now that ranks India

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,319
relatively much lower. So before we

49
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,800
light more fireworks over GDP, what we

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,959
need to see is that India is already

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,520
getting divided. While one India is

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,360
celebrating the $4 trillion GDP mark,

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
the other India is still wondering how

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
to stretch 400 rupees till the end of

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
the month. While one India is building

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
startups, the other India is still

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,239
searching for toilets. While one India

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,239
is flying to Bali for offsides, the

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,120
other India is still walking 5

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,840
kilometers just for clean water. And

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,720
both these Indas are real. They exist on

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,680
the same street, sometimes even in the

63
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,560
same house. And the truth is a $4

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,360
trillion economy with two Indas is not a

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,680
success story. It's an incomplete story.

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
But the good news is that we can fix it.

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,760
And in today's case study, we want to

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,959
use the World Bank's report to help you

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,879
understand why exactly is India failing.

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,640
Which economic mistake did Malaysia,

71
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,319
South Africa, and Brazil make that

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,159
killed their growth? What do we need to

73
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,080
learn from the legendary story of South

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
Korea? And what are the lessons that

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,360
you, me, and a billion other people need

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
to scream to our

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,720
politicians? This video is brought to

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
you by the communication masterclass

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,480
course. If you're an executive who wants

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
to communicate your ideas as powerful

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
leaders and not as shy, timid

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,519
individuals, you must join our

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
communication masterclass course.

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,879
Because the truth is, you could be the

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,879
hardest working person in the room, but

86
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
if you're not communicating your value,

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,799
you will always stay invisible. And the

88
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,480
person who knows how to speak well will

89
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
always get the promotion that you

90
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
deserve. So, if you're this ambitious

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
person who wants to speak with

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,440
confidence and clarity, you must join

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,879
our communication masterclass course.

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,560
And if you don't find value in this

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,879
course in the first 7 days, we will

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,480
return your money with no questions

97
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,480
asked. I have crafted this course

to become a confident leader, click the

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,199
link in the description and I will see

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,199
you in the live

114
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,800
[Music]

115
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,720
session. To understand the problem with

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
the Indian economy, you first need to

117
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
understand the dangers of the middle

118
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,479
income trap. And the classic case study

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
to understand it would be the Malaysian

120
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,040
miracle story of 1960. The states of

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
Malaysia are mainly lands of jungles and

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
swamps. So most of the people live near

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,000
the sea or on the banks of the rivers to

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
help overcome a limited food supply. The

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
government has built ponds and stocked

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,479
them with fish to provide an additional

127
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,199
source of food. And even though they've

128
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,039
been living in the country all their

129
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,479
lives, they don't exist legally as a

130
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,720
people in the place they were born. But

131
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,600
they've been denied their basic rights

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,479
that other citizens enjoy, including the

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,199
rights to education, healthcare, and

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,800
employment. Is there really a future for

135
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,039
them? Living in a home away from home?

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
You see, back in the 1960s, this is what

137
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
Malaysia looked like. It was filled with

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,520
slums. People were poor, and Malaysia

139
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,360
was just another poor country struggling

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,720
to survive. While the Malaysians earned

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,720
just $240 a year, nearly half of their

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,520
population lived below the poverty line.

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,440
In fact, 50% of them couldn't even read

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,199
or write. But this is when the

145
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Malaysians decided to change their

146
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,240
destiny. And just like India today, they

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,080
went allin on three important investment

148
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
pillars. Just like India today is

149
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
building highways after highways,

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,479
Malaysia increased their infrastructure

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,600
spending from just 1.9% of its GDP to

152
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,840
9.4% of GDP. Secondly, just like India,

153
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,240
Malaysia invested heavily into primary

154
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,280
and secondary education and increased

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,520
literacy to

156
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,440
96%. And finally, Malaysia improved ease

157
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
of doing business with free trade zones,

158
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,000
tax breaks, and cheaper electricity.

159
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,479
This is how within a decade, Malaysia

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,479
went from an Asian nightmare to an Asian

161
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,440
miracle. Look at this. The average

162
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,280
income in Malaysia went from $374 in

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,840
1970 to

164
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,000
$4,45 in 1995. And guess what? It

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,120
crossed $10,000 by late 2011. So

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,960
Malaysia's per capita GDP increased by

167
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,039
$2,500% in just a few decades. But

168
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,680
here's where the problem started. Look

169
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,720
at this chart. It shows how Korea,

170
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,280
Poland, and Chile grew over the past 60

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,520
years. And here you can see that all

172
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,240
three nations started off as poor

173
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,639
nations. But watch what happens next.

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Korea somehow pulls away and gets richer

175
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,240
and richer and crosses

176
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,639
$30,000. While all other countries, they

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,080
stall around

178
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,240
$15,000. Why? Because here's what people

179
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,479
forgot about the Malaysian miracle. The

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,880
Malaysian miracle wasn't built on tech

181
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,680
or innovation or billiondollar brands.

182
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,520
It was built on just one thing, cheap

183
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,479
labor. Malaysia opened its doors in the

184
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,840
1980s and '90s and the world rushed in.

185
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,000
Intel, Sony, AMD, Motorola all came to

186
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,319
Malaysia because it was the factory of

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
Asia. Labor was cheap, land was

188
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,240
affordable and the government made it

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,080
easy to set up shop. Assembly lines ran

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,000
day and night, exports boomed and jobs

191
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,400
exploded. For a while, it worked very,

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
very

193
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,280
beautifully. Intel Corporation chose

194
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,919
Pinang as its first site outside of the

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,160
US in 1972.

196
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,240
The tech powerhouse currently employs

197
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
more than 8,000 highly skilled

198
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Malaysians. As Malaysia grows more

199
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,639
prosperous, we're beginning to see a

200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,080
rising middle class, which is demanding

201
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,960
more services. In 1980, Malaysia's GDP

202
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,599
was near $25 billion, and the country's

203
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,360
economy has been booming. Malaysia has

204
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,759
become a barometer for the emerging

205
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,240
markets. But here's the catch. When your

206
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,319
only value is cheap labor, your biggest

207
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,240
threat is just someone cheaper. I

208
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,720
repeat, when your only value is cheap

209
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,360
labor, your biggest threat is just

210
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
someone cheaper. And that is exactly

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
what happened to the Malaysian miracle.

212
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
As Malaysia developed, wages naturally

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,919
went up. So increasing wages sounds

214
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
good, right? But the problem was that

215
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,839
the moment Motorola, Intel, and all

216
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,240
other companies saw another country that

217
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
was cheaper, they simply moved out. And

218
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,000
look at this. By 2020, the average

219
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,959
monthly earnings for manufacturing

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,560
workers in Malaysia was

221
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,600
$458. Meanwhile, Vietnam was

222
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,120
significantly lower at $310. Indonesia

223
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,320
was even lower at $28 and Thailand was

224
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,640
slightly below Malaysia at $397.

225
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,279
Not because Malaysia failed, but because

226
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,800
Malaysia got expensive without getting

227
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,720
better. And here's another trap that

228
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,560
Malaysia fell into. While a lot of

229
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
people went to school, the education

230
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,880
system did not produce innovation. It

231
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
produced graduates with degrees, but

232
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,320
very few opportunities to apply them. So

233
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,200
from 2000 to 2010, Malaysia still

234
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,360
assembled, but Malaysia did not design.

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,839
They still exported, but they never

236
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,320
really built great brands. They still

237
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,640
worked very hard but they couldn't move

238
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,040
higher. So eventually when the factory

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,279
started leaving the economy had no new

240
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,279
engine to replace them and the result

241
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,320
well the first generation worked and the

242
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,519
second generation was just left

243
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,839
undermployed and eventually the

244
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,320
country's economy started stalling in

245
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,760
the face of the economic downturn and

246
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,080
the low wages that we're seeing

247
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,000
especially for uh university graduates.

248
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
They find it very hard to get work which

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,959
is commensurate with their

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
qualification. More than

251
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:08,720
250,000 students graduate from higher

252
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,279
education institutions every year. But

253
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,360
sadly one out of five graduates remain

254
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,279
unemployed. Now Malaysians should brace

255
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,440
for a tough times as the economy is

256
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,920
facing real problems amid external

257
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
situations beyond its control. Projects

258
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,959
abandoned, the currency plummeting,

259
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,800
banks and major corporations teetering.

260
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,320
Foreign investors the world over are

261
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,240
pulling out capital from emerging

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
markets such as Malaysia because of

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,720
concerns over global growth. Look at

264
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,000
this chart. Malaysia's income grew very

265
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,880
fast up to 2009. But after that you see

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,200
a flat wavy stuck curve. There was no

267
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,200
crash as such but there was no progress

268
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,040
also. And look at this. In 2023 over 36%

269
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,120
of Malaysian university graduates were

270
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,640
undermployed. You know what that means?

271
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
Engineers were working as customer

272
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
service representatives. Degree holders

273
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,839
were delivering food orders. And after

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,000
four years of university, graduates were

275
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,279
asked to spam call people and sell

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,880
insurance. This was the story of

277
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,800
Malaysia. Sounds very familiar to India,

278
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,519
right? But this is where India needs to

279
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,240
turn to South Korea because South Korea

280
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,320
is truly an economic miracle. In the

281
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
1960s, South Korea was one of the

282
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,480
poorest countries in the world. In fact,

283
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,880
even poorer than Malaysia. It was a

284
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,279
walton, resourced, and desperate

285
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,480
country. It was a country in abject

286
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,160
poverty. With its land ravaged by

287
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,240
war and did not have even the most

288
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,360
meager

289
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,360
resources, this country has no

290
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,519
future. A lot of orphans and then the

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
beggars everywhere. South Korea was

292
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,839
reliant on international aid for its

293
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,800
continued existence following the end of

294
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,360
the Korean War. Unable to recover from

295
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,800
the ruins of war on its own, Korea was

296
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
forced to rely on foreign

297
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,120
aid. But you know what they had? They

298
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,120
had a generational vision. One

299
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,360
generation would work, the next would

300
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,519
study and the third would invent. That

301
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,839
is how the per capita GDP of South Korea

302
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,600
started rising. Let me explain. The

303
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,360
first generation of South Korea was the

304
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
generation of workers. They worked in

305
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,480
textile factories, shipyards, and steel

306
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,240
plants. hard labor, long hours, and low

307
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,320
pay. But they produced something

308
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,560
valuable, something exportable. And

309
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,560
those exports brought in foreign money

310
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,720
into the economy. This first wave of

311
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,279
employment lifted the GDP per capita

312
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,480
from just $280 in 1970 to

313
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:40,639
1,715 by 1980. 60 years later, Korea has

314
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,720
become a global power with the world's

315
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,560
12th largest economy. Korea's

316
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
export-driven economy is still being

317
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,360
driven by six industries which can

318
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,279
expect to expand even further in the

319
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,279
future. It is the home of the global

320
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,880
headquarters of Hyundai heavy industry.

321
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,880
South Korea's ship building industry,

322
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,600
the number one in the world. South Korea

323
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,760
posts a trade surplus for 22 straight

324
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,760
months. The Republic of Korea is

325
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
strengthening its position as an active

326
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,560
player in international trade thanks to

327
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,200
its manufacturing competitiveness, solid

328
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,440
growth of its main export items and

329
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,360
diversification of markets. And then

330
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
came generation 2, the graduate

331
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,880
generation. When factory jobs got paid

332
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
enough to send kids to school, the

333
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,800
government stepped in and the government

334
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,120
started investing massively into STEM

335
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,560
education. STEM as in science,

336
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,240
technology, engineering, and

337
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,040
mathematics. And by 1980s, South Korea

338
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,000
had world-class engineers, world-class

339
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,320
scientists, and world-class managers. So

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
now, instead of just making things,

341
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,880
South Koreans could actually design

342
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,519
products, improve products, and manage

343
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,600
their production all by themselves. For

344
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,360
example, back in the 1970s and 80s,

345
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,000
South Korea just assembled televisions

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,160
using Japanese parts. But by the 1990s,

347
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Samsung wasn't just assembling TVs. It

348
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,399
designed its own screens, created

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,040
proprietary chipsets, and led the global

350
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,959
display industry. And today, Samsung

351
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,519
doesn't just make electronics. It

352
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,959
designs screens used in Apple iPhone.

353
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,959
Samsung is a brand name that's

354
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,279
everywhere in more than 100 million US

355
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,360
households, Android phones, TVs,

356
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,800
refrigerators, and unconventional

357
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,440
displays. So, the 13-in uh display can

358
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,360
be as big as 17 in. This is the future

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,199
of display. Lee has made it one of the

360
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,519
world's most important and valuable

361
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,440
companies. It's not just making devices,

362
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
it's making the chips that power them.

363
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,519
People probably don't know that we've

364
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,360
led memory for three decades. Samsung

365
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,959
gained international notoriety with the

366
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,440
world's first 64 megbit DM chip in 1992.

367
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,360
Its presence is so ubiquitous in South

368
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,760
Korea that they call their country the

369
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,600
Republic of Samsung. Every major company

370
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,199
out there, Apple, you know, they have to

371
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,959
bend the knee to Samsung. They have to

372
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,880
get their chips, their displays. Uh,

373
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,560
this is a company that everybody has to

374
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
go through at some point to get what

375
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,320
they need because they're so

376
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,560
influential. Now, let that sink in. The

377
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,279
same company that once assembled TVs for

378
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,079
others now powers the display of the

379
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,720
world's most premium smartphone. That's

380
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,279
not assembly, that is value creation.

381
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,120
And that is exactly how the GDP per

382
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,000
capita skyrockets when you move from

383
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,079
cheap labor to worldclass innovation.

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,320
This shift from the factory floor to

385
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,920
engineering office pushed up wages,

386
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
pushed up productivity, and most

387
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,800
importantly, it pushed up GDP. Look at

388
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,040
this. The South Korean GDP per capita

389
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,440
shot up from

390
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:34,000
$6,610 in 1990 to over 12,200 by 2000.

391
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,720
And then came the final leap, the

392
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,880
generation of innovators. It's part of a

393
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
wider trend here in Korea to foster the

394
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,880
start of new businesses by younger

395
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,199
Koreans. The number of new businesses

396
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,440
started by people under the age of 30

397
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,600
hit an all-time high. Korea is very has

398
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
a very strong engineering base and also

399
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,680
design talent which is very important

400
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,000
nowadays. The development of smart cars

401
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,480
and eventually driverless vehicles

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,320
managing robots in teley medicine or in

403
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,480
industry. It's been found a Hyundai

404
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,639
Motors Electronics and LG Electronics

405
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,480
are among the top 10 global companies

406
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,320
with the most patents related to

407
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,160
self-driving technology. Ria also

408
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
attempted a revolution in the

409
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,079
information technology industry. The

410
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,639
cuttingedge enterprises that were

411
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,560
founded during the IT boom, provided a

412
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,320
new stimulus to the economy. You see,

413
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,399
the children of engineers did not just

414
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,399
stop at good jobs. They started filing

415
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,959
patents, building startups, and

416
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,839
launching global brands. And from 2000

417
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,759
to 2020, Korea wasn't just exporting

418
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,639
electronics. It exported Samsung

419
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,560
smartphones, Hyundai cars, and LG

420
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,040
displays. In fact, Hyundai was once

421
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,440
mocked for making cheap, clunky cars.

422
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,920
But now they build electric vehicles,

423
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,000
luxury models, and even invest in

424
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,040
hydrogen-powered transport, and even

425
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,440
flying taxis. This wasn't luck, guys. It

426
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,600
was three generations of progress.

427
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,240
Factory workers, then engineers, and

428
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,079
then worldclass innovators. And today,

429
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,560
South Korea isn't making cheap assembly

430
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,720
goods anymore. They make high value,

431
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,280
globally respected products. because of

432
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,000
which today their per capita income is

433
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,919
just growing like crazy. It's not magic.

434
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,720
It is the people climbing the economic

435
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,079
ladder together. Today, South Korea's

436
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,760
per capita GDP stands at

437
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,640
$33,000. That is how South Korea made an

438
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,280
epic transformation from $150 per capita

439
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,280
GDP to

440
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,039
$33,000 per capita. If this is very

441
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,240
clear to you, let's talk about India.

442
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,640
Because while we've been watching

443
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,480
Malaysia stall and South Korea rise,

444
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,559
India is approaching its moment of

445
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,679
truth. So the question is where does

446
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,919
India stand today? Well, on paper, India

447
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,600
looks like it's booming. Record-breaking

448
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,200
startups are coming out. Bullet trains

449
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,360
are being planned. Highways are being

450
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
built at lightning speed. GDP is growing

451
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,440
faster than major economies all around

452
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,160
the world. All these numbers look very

453
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,520
very lucrative. But if we look closely,

454
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,280
the picture is far far complicated. You

455
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,600
see, India officially became a lower

456
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,880
middle- inome country in 2007. Today,

457
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,679
our per capita income is around

458
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,520
$2,400. And if you look at the

459
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,679
historical progress, it looks like a

460
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,760
significant progress. But here's what

461
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,679
the number hides. India is not one

462
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,080
economic story, it's three different

463
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,720
countries stacked on top of each other.

464
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,039
Let's break it down. The top 10%, as in

465
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,760
the top 120 million Indians, live like

466
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,919
Germans, earning more than $15,000 per

467
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
capita. They've got global jobs. They

468
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,240
invest in US stocks and they order

469
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,160
avocado toast via Zumato. The middle 300

470
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,480
million Indians live like Bangladesh.

471
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,400
They hustle, they escape poverty, but

472
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,799
they're just one medical bill away from

473
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,160
slipping back. And then we have the

474
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,559
bottom billion. Here we have 1 billion

475
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,559
people with a per capita income of just

476
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,760
$1,000. And these people live like the

477
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,320
people of subsaharan Africa. Yes, you

478
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,320
heard that right. Over 1 billion Indians

479
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,400
live like the poorest parts of the

480
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,039
world. We are talking about no proper

481
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,120
sanitation, no stable electricity, no

482
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,120
digital access and very limited

483
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,430
[Music]

484
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,679
opportunity. What is it meant for rural

485
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,840
areas where children don't have access

486
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,559
to devices by which they can access

487
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,640
online classes? For the young and the

488
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,880
old, this railway track is their

489
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,760
equivalent of a bathroom. These public

490
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,840
facilities are filthy, smelling, and the

491
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,280
only option for people here if they want

492
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,679
to use a public toilet. Smart grid or

493
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,679
smart meterology.

494
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,470
street

495
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,470
[Music]

496
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,919
light. So while India's average per

497
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,840
capita income is

498
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,880
$2,400, the economic experience of the

499
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,720
bottom 70% is nothing short of a

500
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,799
nightmare. And this is where it gets

501
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,960
scary. Just like Malaysia, India is

502
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,720
banking on cheap labor and exports from

503
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,720
this bottom billion. We are trying to

504
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,200
grow by assembling phones, cars, and

505
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,160
gadgets. But here's the hard truth.

506
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,039
Wages alone won't build a rich country.

507
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,280
And factories alone won't lift a billion

508
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,280
people out of poverty. And Malaysia

509
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
tried that, but they got stuck. And

510
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,520
today, we have three big traps that

511
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,840
we're just walking right into. First is

512
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,000
the education trap in India. In India,

513
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,799
we produce millions of graduates every

514
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,400
year, but only about 45% of them

515
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,480
actually possess the necessary skills

516
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,120
for the job market. Now that's not a

517
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,039
skill gap. That is a system failure. We

518
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,360
build coaching centers but we forgot to

519
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,840
build campuses. We teach kids to crack

520
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,320
exams but not solve problems. And the

521
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,799
result underpaid engineers, unemployed

522
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,799
MBAs and a generation full of degrees

523
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,760
but no direction. In fact, the

524
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,400
underemployment situation is so bad that

525
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,919
when the UP government released 62 polls

526
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:06,480
for a pun job, more than 93,000 people

527
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:10,159
applied, including 3,700 PhDs, 50,000

528
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,320
graduates and 28,000 post-graduates.

529
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,960
This is the education trap that we're

530
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,760
walking into. Third grade education and

531
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,280
no scope of innovation. Then we have the

532
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,919
next trap, which is the innovation

533
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,000
deficit trap. Despite our massive size

534
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,840
and potential, you know what? India

535
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,840
spends only 0.7% of its GDP on R&D. And

536
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,159
if you compare that to other countries,

537
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,480
it will put you to shame. South Korea

538
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,679
stands at 5.21%, Germany stands at

539
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,280
2.68%, China stands at 2.56%. Now mind

540
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,400
you, we're talking about the Chinese

541
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,400
economy which is sitting at $17 trillion

542
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,919
which is practically four times bigger

543
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,799
than India. So if you see we are

544
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,280
practically nowhere guys. In fact India

545
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,360
files fewer than 100,000 patents a year

546
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,320
while South Korea files over 150,000

547
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,440
patents. The US files 280,000 patents

548
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,080
and China files 600,000 patents a year.

549
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
They build Samsung, Hyundai and LG while

550
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,840
we still waiting for the next Indian

551
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
global brand. And you know what's the

552
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,520
worst part? We are not even good at

553
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,039
assembly guys. We are not building the

554
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,600
next Samsung. We are not building the

555
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,760
next Hundai. We are not even winning the

556
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,440
lowcost manufacturing game. Did you know

557
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,520
that? This is a game that Malaysia

558
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,600
played 40 years ago by the way. And let

559
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,360
me tell you why. We are still struggling

560
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,360
with basic literacy. Our engineering

561
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,080
colleges are not producing inventors.

562
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,320
They produce copypaste research papers

563
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,159
just to pass semester exams. And

564
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,200
thirdly, even if our people want to

565
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,960
work, we don't have enough factories. Do

566
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,039
you remember the grand vision of making

567
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,480
India? It was supposed to make India the

568
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,400
factory of the world. But 10 years

569
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,880
later, what happened? Manufacturing's

570
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,840
share of GDP has barely moved. It was

571
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,720
15% in 2014 and even after 10 years,

572
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,880
it's still lingering around 15 to 17%.

573
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,760
This is the reason why our productivity

574
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,840
cannot skyrocket. Our cheap labor is not

575
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,080
being leveraged. And even if we succeed

576
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,400
in cheap labor tomorrow, if there's

577
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,559
another country in Asia or Africa that

578
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,840
has cheaper labor, just like in

579
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:15,440
Malaysia, companies will move out of

580
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,480
India. This is how we are walking into a

581
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,360
middle income trap. So the question is

582
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,280
what do we do? Well, the solution is

583
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,120
pretty straightforward. It's called the

584
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,360
three eye framework. Investment,

585
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,200
innovation, and infusion. Let's look at

586
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,440
South Korea again to understand better.

587
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,000
In the 1960s, while South Korea's GDP

588
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,919
per capita was $150, instead of

589
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
depending on foreign aid, they built a

590
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,360
road map to attract investment. They

591
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,520
poured money into infrastructure,

592
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,440
reformed land rights, made starting

593
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,440
businesses ridiculously easy, and most

594
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,000
importantly, they invested in primary

595
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,919
education with laser focus. This

596
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
attracted factories. Factories created

597
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,080
jobs. Jobs created income. And that

598
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,159
income lifted millions of people out of

599
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,799
poverty. We are partially succeeding

600
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,039
here, but not fully. There's still a lot

601
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,799
more work to do. Malaysia succeeded at

602
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,640
this first stage as well. But here's

603
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,640
where most countries stop. And here's

604
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,880
where Korea knew something that others

605
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,240
did not. Korea knew that investment

606
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,480
alone cannot make Korea rich. And this

607
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,200
is where the next stage starts which is

608
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,880
called infusion as if climbing the value

609
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,080
chain. In South Korea, instead of

610
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
staying at the bottom of the supply

611
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,559
chain, they decided to climb it. To do

612
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,400
that, they imported technology. Samsung

613
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,960
began licensing designs from Japanese

614
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,960
giants like Sano and NEC. They reverse

615
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,200
engineered products, built domestic

616
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
capacity, and produced better versions.

617
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,559
And while Samsung was doing this, the

618
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,320
Korean government backed them. Look at

619
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,760
this line chart. The government first

620
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,159
played a crucial role where they

621
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,080
introduced adoption subsidies as in they

622
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,080
rewarded companies to copy tech. And

623
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,400
while Malaysia kept assembling imported

624
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,799
parts, Korea started mimicking global

625
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,200
brands and then they built their own

626
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,360
global brands. But even this had limits

627
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,520
because at some point you can't just

628
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,279
copy, you must create. And this is where

629
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,520
the third stage came in which was the

630
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,799
innovation stage. This is called the

631
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,799
final leap. In the 1980s and '90s, Korea

632
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,120
stopped subsidizing tech adoption and

633
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,520
they started heavily funding R&D. They

634
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,320
gave money to companies not to copy, but

635
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,520
this time to invent and the results were

636
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:21,679
absolutely insane. In 1980, Korea spent

637
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,880
just 0.5% of GDP on R&D. But by 1990, it

638
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,640
tripled to 1.6%. And today, they've

639
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,039
tripled it again, reaching 4.8% of GDP.

640
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,240
And the result, private sector R&D

641
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,840
exploded, growing by 26 times in a

642
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,919
single decade. But here's another

643
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,840
important point. Just spending money on

644
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,559
R&D doesn't guarantee intellectual

645
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,880
property because innovation isn't just a

646
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,919
result of cash infusion. It is a result

647
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,919
of brilliant minds put together. So you

648
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,679
need innovators. And you know what Korea

649
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,279
did? They ramped up higher education

650
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,039
spending. They trained engineers,

651
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,880
scientists, managers by the thousands.

652
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,720
And the results were revolutionary.

653
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,440
Samsung went from selling noodles to

654
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,440
inventing curved OLED screens. Hundai

655
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,159
went from assembling parts to building

656
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,320
entire vehicles from scratch. LG stopped

657
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,159
being a budget appliance maker and

658
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,159
started building futuristic batteries

659
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,000
and flexible displays. Now you might be

660
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,520
thinking, bro, even India has Bajage

661
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,760
Bidline Reliance, right? Sure we do. A

662
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,760
few giants are definitely innovating in

663
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,320
India. But here's the difference. In

664
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,240
India, innovation is the exception. In

665
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,360
South Korea, it's the system. And I want

666
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,480
to prove this using numbers. In 2023,

667
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,120
while South Korea files over 156,972

668
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,440
patents globally, India files just over

669
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,320
82,811 patents. That's a 2x gap in spite

670
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,120
of Korea having just 125th of India's

671
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,440
population. So yeah, a country with 100

672
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,080
times less population than India is

673
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,799
still spending more on R&D and it is

674
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,720
filing more patents than India. A

675
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:58,880
country with 1.4 4 billion people. So

676
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,880
you tell me guys, am I being anti-India

677
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,120
or a patriot breaking the delusion that

678
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,360
we're living in? Drop a comment below so

679
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,200
that we can let India know that real

680
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,840
patriotism is not about living in

681
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,120
delusion but in fixing reality. And if

682
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,520
you are a politician who's watching this

683
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,200
episode, please understand that we don't

684
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,600
mean to disrespect the work that you've

685
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,559
done. We just hope that we do slightly

686
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,000
better. Our job as creators is to point

687
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,799
out the flaws and improvements that

688
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,600
could possibly be made so that we as a

689
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,559
country can go further. So you and I are

690
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,200
not oppositions. We are on the same team

691
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,440
because we both want India to grow. So

692
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,080
if you want India to grow, please let us

693
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,559
know what you are doing so that we just

694
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,080
like South Korea can become an economic

695
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,039
miracle. That's all from my side for

696
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,559
today guys. If you learned something

697
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,320
