Bhram Bhairavaya Namah Bhram Bhairavaya Namah Thank you for being in the Studio again sir. Thank you to us too To call. How are you? I am fine. Where to start? where last time Bhairav ​​had left it. ok or ten mahavidya bhagavati Where you start from. ok maybe from bhairav Let's start. Ok. Whatever this happened What do you think about the past three months? Was? because i remember the first or the second I received a message from you the other day. you said that Bhairav ​​ji is with you. Basically you did this Said. hum hum to would just like to know Because I haven't talked to you outside. Now when you were sitting in front of me for 10-15 minutes I did not talk about it then. So tell me now. When You are in sadhana when you are a seeker If you are, then two things happen in your life. One is a power in your life which Isn't it, she is always there? Are you a seeker or No it is not so. it has some powers which is negative. Ok? but he It lives with you as a parasite and It brings benefits. When you begin to meditate If yes, then remove these powers from your life. Does matter. So he creates all kinds of intrigues that you feel that the gods and the This is sadhana, both of these are wrong for us. And will bring you into such a situation that you One should completely turn away from the practice. just like that Something happened to you. But you stood firm and If you trusted in Sadhana and God then God Whatever Mahamaya's deception was to you Kicked him out. This is a topic. Second is that in sadhana you have to learn Is. then you won't make mistakes and you will learn How? Everybody makes mistakes and Mahamaya makes it happen. and you have a little I made a mistake. It was your narrator's mistake, who said Do people make personnel mistakes? This is what we do. Ok? I have a Read about the topic recently. That The name of the topic is Ego Death. we we are one It is an English word. Ego means self Identification of who I am, what am I? Who am I? What have I done? What can I do? We think of all that He passed away. we their death we My ego died especially in that one week which was the first week we we because We were threatened with violence in our childhood I think I read a couplet by Kabir Where basically they say that the one above has so much power that he can put pressure on you One can cause your ego death by pulling a hair from Is. It can bring an earthquake into your life. That is why it is very important to be humble and polite Is. I just remembered that couplet that friend Everything was fine three-four days ago. then this There was an earthquake. See, life never It does not move linearly. go in the flow like this Does not happen. and if your life is a torrent If I follow you will neither be able to learn anything nor There will be happiness in life. Until and Unless You have Challenges till then you have this courage to live The purpose is that it ends. If suppose linear running you are enjoying life bus It is going on, it is going on. Come on look at you seeker I talked about this and not about what happens in the life of a seeker It happens? Why does it happen so quickly? As A normal person who sells groceries does the shop. He goes in the morning and evening I close the shop and have a family Life goes on. there is something very much in it It doesn't happen. If there is a lot of it in the house, There will be some fights but that is the life which begins his life the way he ends it It happens. When a seeker lives his life Neither does he start acquiring knowledge. Ok? And when you acquire knowledge, If you are learning then it is according to your nature It comes as per calculation. When your knowledge gradually When the eye opens then there are ten great scholars He starts showing you his different side. She does. You start with black The great void remains. you give me some ideas Not there. But you have it all inside you. To you I don't know anything. then the second stage knowledge It comes in which Tara comes. Tara to you It gives knowledge. Ok? The third stage comes It is of Tripura Sundari. Tripura Sundari who Yes, it develops the brain. Fourth Stage Bhuvaneshwari's comes. Bhuvaneshwari arrives So it gives wealth. Then Bhairavi comes What is Bhairavi? She destroys enemies It is around you. So you become supreme. After that which rotates in a sequential manner comes and this goddess who comes, Banglamukhi Here comes, they are goddesses of destruction. So All the empires that you have built will be lost One by one they collapse. And finally Who is coming? Kamala, great glory, great knowledge. Ok? So these are the stages which are 10 Mahavidya It happens to a seeker's life 10 This is Mahavidya. Meaning, if you practice If you start, a timeline will also start goes. A timeline starts with you goes. And you see, the order is 10 Maha Vidya which is written in a sequence that after Kali, Tara and then Tripura Sundari then Bhuvaneshwari then Tripura Bhairavi and finally The order in which Lakshmi comes is not like this It has been written. this is the order it is exactly It happens according to the life of the seeker. And what is in your life right now what does it say If you are around the fifth Mahavidya then you You too will definitely be cured. Your the people around will also be cured so that the costume of a seeker which is a costume I mean it's not clothes, it's the eternal gown When you wear it, Mahalakshmi is with you If it comes, are you ready for it? Let's go, okay, see, there is God too Even gods are not free from mistakes. All gods make mistakes. so that like Maya I just told you about Bhagwati. Each and every goddess You will find such a story of God In which mistakes were made. Lord Dattatreya came into being because Lakshmi ji, Parvati ji and Saraswati ji the three that you When I talked about ego, his ego came to the fore Was. Anusuya was so chaste that she used to hide her clothes I did not bring water. so much their power Was. So he said to Mahadev, Vishnu to Ji and to Brahma ji that you people should go and By breaking the sanctity of Anusuya Give it. So then they went to Anusuya. Then Anusuya kept him as her child. Took it. And then don’t leave them. So The entire balance of the universe is disturbed Done. Then the goddess had to come to Anusuya Near. I apologized for the ego death you caused and then the universe started moving the same way Put. Is it okay? So you will get many such You will get examples. so you can't live in the Remotes that you did something. the point is you You have learned and you should move on. Increased connection have been done. Yes. That is visible. right now means Sadhana is happening with even more devotion Is. And even now it is happening with devotion Was. Butt devotion on steroids. he started to be Is. That I get lost in meditation. and I have realized that that is the right way to do it Sadhana. we we are absolutely. I with my I tell people who are learning that if you want to see Bhagwati, Bhairava Do you want to have darshan of Lord Shiva or any other deity? You are worshipping. until madness sets in Till then if you tie yourself to anything have been. Whether it be an action, whether it be Be it a garland. Ok? until you are in those things Will remain stranded. when you get out of them Only then you are able to pave the way for devotion And the god takes one look and says yes this too Any Is. One change I have adopted is this That means suppose I sit down to meditate I sit in the morning. in the afternoon or evening I sit and then I sit at night. But In those three ah time periods if I If I am not feeling the feeling of devotion then I get up I go from there. do it right and during the day You may feel it in one of the three time periods it goes away at least at night but we are devoted I do not sit down to do sadhana without it. Sadhana walking with you on the path when you and If you do sadhna then it will also happen that you will get many You won't feel like doing sadhana for days. Meaning, you will not feel like you Do worship. There comes a time when you feel may the gods be with us Are. Ok? So at that time, the mantra is Mantra is a vibration. So your power When it is fuller than your body proportion With the mantras you will feel that we are no longer worshipping Do it. Now let us stop chanting for a few days. When Swami Vivekananda was 34 years old He told his brother that I I will die in six years. They Asked why will you die? so said that our body does not accommodate this consciousness I won't be able to handle it. so a very explosive The situation will arise and this is what happened Vivekananda He had many diseases. So this It is true that if you always practice meditation and yoga I don't have the desire to, I don't have the desire to chant Is. so this is perfectly normal what does it mean Your body is realizing how much it needs How much worship to do, how much meditation to do, How much to chant? sometimes something something After chanting the mantras, a little I start having a headache. and that would be a sign That's ok stop at least for me. hardly I have my own system. The chakras must be balanced. If your sir I am in pain that means the mantra Yours is working. but your crown The chakra needs a clearing. So by learning it And the chakras should be cleared. But How has it become unclean? I mean how did Cloudy happen? Then he chanted It happens, right? that's what I said, if you He keeps on chanting and accumulates energy It keeps happening. so either you use that energy you help someone you do something for someone puja do something or pray for someone So that energy will be used. Its just you If you keep accumulating then it will show it Effect. My mentality is that right now Whatever sadhna you have done, the power of that sadhna I am starting some new things regarding Now I am doing Beyond The on YouTube podcast. Because I have learned a lot In five to six years. There is a lot to do. We We are obviously the world's largest economy for India For this we also so this outputting creative work this is right There is a path of sadhana. You get whatever you want now He is planning to leave it to his god Give it. You don't need mantra and sadhna for Yourself. Whatever practice you are doing There will be two fruits. One is that you have this knowledge No, what I said is the cycle of 10 Mahavidyas if you keep moving forward in that then that is Very spiritual. To you in material life What you need and what you can do Leave that to god. Understand one thing. We you can see your life only to the extent that We have seen it till now. Are you understanding? mine which There is exposure, I don't want to end my life there I can see it. but god bless our life I watch too much. So if we practice and asking the gods to we may have an X but we mean our 100X is written in my destiny So we stop at X. that's why Never ever do your sadhana rely on material things You should not do it for this. don't even think Needed If you are doing a thing then you assume that Seems like the god wanted you to do. If you are successful in that, that is also theirs There is work. That's not your job either. Here If failure was to happen then it wouldn't happen to you Would bring it. A seeker should not be afraid of any such thing Do not put any such thing which will fail. Antillean End unleash it is a learning Again. You just said one thing that After the point, Devi also came into your life In. After we worship Bhairava. We this I told you about the timeline because I I guess we didn't talk about it last time I had curry it. Hmm. am i also feel that devi Pooja is less common in Mumbai. we we now There is a lot of devotion among the people here. hmm People are very career oriented in this city. Mata ki chowki on us, goddess worship, goddess These temples are rarely seen in Bombay. When we go to North then we go to U C It's more. More prevalent in the South Is. It is also prevalent in the East. because of that I have seen Devi only in the last 3-4 years I have to go in. no up til then it's been Ganpati Krishna Lord Shiva Hum Hum Bat Ye It's not just my problem. I feel that This is the problem of my entire generation. Plus even online i noticed that definitely There is a lot of content on Bhairava ji. Shiva But there is too much content. Now on Bhairav ​​ji Content Now After 2019 What We Can Find. But initially Bhairava was a god. I mean like when we started worshipping Bhairava When we were kids, people looked at us as outcasts. Look, let me tell you a little about this Keep the topic. Bhairava in our life Had not come earlier. first in our lives Bhagwati had come. We guys, you, yes, okay. Since childhood what happened was that we, we, in our home, Nana ji was the one who recited Durga Saptashati Used to recite. And our job was to assist them to do. So like now Durga Saptashati is going on If so, burn incense there; the lamp is burning keep watching, do all this and keep doing that The Durga Saptashati which he used to recite I also I kept remembering and along with it, I was with Bhagwati One I felt very connected. Correct Is? When we came into the path of Tantra, the first The initiation that we had was also Tara Mantra It started from. So we asked Guruji that Why are we starting with Tara Mantra? So Bhagwati Tara is the motherly form. When Mahadev drank poison in the form of a mother During the churning of the ocean he swallowed the poison I restrained myself and saved them from that havoc. I was in a lot of pain. very jealous Was. Then Mahamaya took the form of Bhagwati Tara at that time. I came and Mahadev became a small child And breastfed them. then from that milk That jealousy of Mahadev stopped. So In the Tantra path it is said that Bhagwati If you do sadhna of Tara then Mahadev comes running after him. Ok? So our beginning was with Bhagwati Durga By sadhana. Ok? worship whatever it is It happened as per Durga Shapati. then tara and We had a connection with Tarapitha. all this when were doing it so we told you that one time It came to pass that there was a great deal of money in our lives There was a shortage. At that time we should do Tara Sadhna only. Were living. So besides the Guru Mantra we have 10 Mahavid was doing sadhna of Tara and Only Tara was visible to us. Ok? That At that time we had also given up Durga Sadhna. What was your age then? We have started Tara Sadhana It was done in 2013 and we were born in 84 In. 29 This was it. So in 2017 we had a Nathji in Rajasthan meet. Nathji means one who belongs to Nath sect coming. But what is there is not The magician is Nath ji. which is very People are Pandora. The meaning of Pandora That they show you the tricks. people in it They get stuck. What kind of tricks? So in the room Shower me with notes. Ok? extract money from the ground Give. So that was the way he used to work. Now That Shivalok of Manohar is no more. So he Once I met him, he told me that whatever you are doing right now you need Bhairava You should do sadhana otherwise you will lose your things It won't be ok. I said why ok Won't it be? So he said that it is Maya's work To throw the seekers away. and who balances it Is? Mahadev Shiv form balances it In. Then he told me to do Bhairava Sadhna, All these things are the method of Bhairav ​​Sadhana Taught me. After that what happened was that the people there Nath is there, he does sadhna on voice Are. Meaning he doesn't say any words. they have Some sounds. He doesn't even teach everyone. Ok? and the method that he described But I have been doing sadhana for two-three years, I did what was taught in Bali Pooja. There was a desire to move beyond that. So There was a sadhak who was a big name in Tarapith Kamakhya was his Veernath Yes, if in modern India there is a very big When the name of Aghori is taken then he is a doctor Ramnath is an Aghori. And those who direct The disciple was Veernath ji. So Veernath ji When I met him, I started crying. I had heard his name so much. He is in Ranchi There is an ashram. yes it is. He is now deceased. Shiva went to heaven in 125 years. So when When we went to meet him, we went thinking that We were thinking that we will take the mantra of Bhairava from him. Correct Is? So we went to meet him. He was very happy We sat together for five to six hours. Very All kinds of things happened. Food happened, whatever happened Happened. But we couldn't tell them that we Please give me the Bhairav ​​mantra. Ok. say that mean I couldn't even find it. There was no chance, no meaning It felt appropriate to talk to him. a few days Went again later. Then we sat for 5-6 hours Couldn't speak. Well, your 5 and a quarter year old saint if someone is sitting in front of you then you should wait 10 minutes before speaking. I have to think many times whether I should say it or not Speak. Went again on the third day. On the third day we thought I will speak today and then I will not be able to speak. Meaning, I could not speak even though I wanted to. And we started to go That okay Guru Maharaj, we are leaving. when we As he came out of the gate he entered a small room I used to sleep in a corner, so he said that you will be able to handle Bhairav ​​if you ask a direct question We said yes, we will handle this much It is not easy to handle Bhairav, we are not Gurudev will take care of it and after that very Bhairav ​​temple in Ranchi miraculously After the Bhairav ​​temple was built, Bhagwati's temple was built The establishment of Bhagwati which was established We have a place called Ramnagar in Bihar. There By inviting Bhagawati from your own is placed in place. and then there again Durga Puja has begun. So the only one like that It is Durga Puja which lasts for nine days Durga is worshipped according to Tantra method. Now So Durga Puja too is going to become extinct Put. You are talking about here. I I was watching Durga Puja here. So It is said in the scriptures that whatever you have is different We bring soil from this place and make Durga from it The vigraha of Ka is created The puja which goes on for nine days, I have seen it at many places It was seen here that those POP statues were moving It is like a thing in which life cannot come. At our place too, the Kalash would be placed from the fourth day Are. What is fundamentally religion now? is coming back. I can say this. So But in the last 20 years the entire religion has Was destroyed. In the last 20 years, 202 in years yes since 2000 since 2000 approximately why Our generation or those just before us When that generation grew up, they were separated from religion There was not much attachment. We mostly live in India Wasn't it a place for displaced people? Everyone left their village and came somewhere to earn money have been. So those who are coming to earn, their first The aim was that their child should also study Whatever I have, I started earning. Ok? So the one who is Religion requires mental stability He is the Maximum India's to follow It was not there. Well, on the side where this stability was Where the displacement is less There, religion is going on as it is. But in North India and wherever you see that modernization is where factories are built The religion there was completely destroyed. Now the AP center of Durga Puja is Kolkata Is. So many days for the communists in Kolkata It remained a secret. the government system that is still in place It is very secular. So that is also the goddess's They make it secular. without weapons is worshipped. Isn't it? So this is going on. So when Durga was worshipped in our place So when we used to see it, we felt No, there should be such worship at a place where But the whole method is as per the rules and regulations Should be worshipped? So for the past six years now Now Durga is being worshipped in our temple Is. Right or wrong way to worship Where is it written? The first topic we That puja is done in two ways. Agamas and Corporation. This is one way, which is Tantra path. So In the path of Tantra, the book of Tantra path are you to him Study under some guru and Understand it and then do it. that tantra path Worship is done with it. The second Vedic law There is a scriptural rule for worship, right? We and you don't have to do that puja. His simple principle is that you Call him. You can only be a host to it Are. You cannot perform the puja on your own. So don't put your mind to it at all That is how puja should be done. means you You are saying that puja is mostly done in everyone's house It happens to us which our mother always does We will actually do that by bringing a Pandit. We don't need those who worship at home Yes, that is tantric worship, okay, that is Vedic It is not everyone's matter who is in everyone's house People also worship lord Krishna Absolutely respectful of duty Because as soon as you come to Panch Puja If yes then it is a Tantric puja. What Is Panch Puja performed? Panch puja means you You lit the incense stick in front of the deity You lit the fire, you offered it to them You offered sandalwood to him and offered flowers to him You offered these five things to this Tantrik The method is in the Vedic method of worship that You will light the havan and perform it, is that okay? Just this, as soon as you performed the Panch Puja does it mean that you are a tantrik Worshiping as per the method. Ok. Are you saying that most of the people especially this We are still listening to that podcast have I ever worshipped in my life He has already used the system. they're doing it, they're doing it. you kept the defiance If you take it then the idol is a device. Hmm. You Keeping the yantra and chanting mantras along with it If you are pronouncing it then you are doing tantra Are. And now in the coming years we will be The high level will be in an advanced version In our country. Yes. This is a fight. Absolutely. So home You can advance while sitting On the path of Tantra. This is what we are saying to you. Yes. Ok. But you talked about Durga Puja you said i think what i understood When you worship Shakti, that is worship It is a little fiery, a little aggressive And such fierce worships were probably not there 100 years ago 200 years ago we were very normal in India But now she has become normal a lot because of British Rule etc. in which case Our country had different factors. but that Everything will come back now. We just now worship that fiery Let's talk a little bit about it. we came No, now we will know a little about the practice of sacrifice. I will talk to you. Let’s start from there Because this is an internet friendly topic. Look at this Tantra Shastra. Ok? on that There is no point in debating. You You will see that those who oppose the practice of sacrifice Those people are calling themselves Vaishnavs Are. Ok? And since he is a Vaishnav They feel that you should not make sacrifices. Ok? Because he is a vegetarian. Mr Karpatri Maharaj it is okay that at the last moment of the religious assembly Was the president. He spoke on the subject It was when one of his devotees came and He had asked that Agnihotra Brahmin Were. Agnihotra havan is performed to the Sun For. So we asked him to perform a wet havan Or perform dry havan. this story is complete Shankaracharya Mahabhag has also told this. Meaning Wet havan means that first the sacrifice And with that meat again for the sun We perform havan for the Sun. Ok? And Dry havan means the havan which is performed with the havan material It happens. Ok? So he said that You should perform wet havan. means first sunrayan Sacrifice it and then offer it to him as havan Should be done. What is sacrificed? Of the goat. Isn't it? Those of us who follow the path of Tantra If there are people then the Panchamakar prevails amongst us. Without meat, our worship is not complete Is. Is it okay? So we debate in Tantra I won't do it at all. if anybody is even talking that you should not sacrifice then it does Doesn't matter. It does not matter to us whether Who is saying what? That practice of ours Is. It means that after someone Someone else is expressing his opinion. so someone's The intent doesn't matter. what is religion are you speaking? That's all I have to see. Effectively all sadhna including basic If we sit in one place and do meditation Chant the mantra HAM ENIDE THE MIND. We There is an energy build up. Are we okay? Over the years I'm from. So, what is your diet? Because of that energy build up gets affected Can it? as it is said that chakra can gate Blocked because of non veg etc. So, I I have thought a lot about this subject. and please correct me if you say you are you You I'm wrong. butt i think different mantra has different rules. but is that right or wrong? See, there are no different rules for different mantras There are. Different gods have different rules. So, when you are doing sadhana for someone, right? So gradually your nature and behavior Nor does he become like your East. That If you are a devotee of Narayan. Now Narayan who You will do whatever you enjoy, right? we are this It works in this manner. Meaning, you should understand one thing. the body of a human being or You have a brain, you can see it in any dimension Can not push. you can suppress Are. And the thing which you will suppress He is in some form or the other and he is Will get back to you. Ok? So when you If you are following religion then no religion should allow it to flow as you As you begin to practice, When you follow the gods in the same way His grace will keep coming to you and things will be in your favor will change automatically in life and that is You might think that I am the one doing this. Then you may have what God wants that you become a vegetarian but that god will take you to a place where you will feel I don't need it. the day you think because if I don't do that then I will be very I will develop in sadhana. it does not Is. This does not happen. One might understand that I have completely understood the game of Mahamaya. So the gods could not understand what we understood Will find it. you're gonna get all this mixed up By not eating food. Isn't it? And I last Bar also said that food is a matter of option For those who have money. We give you the money If not, then you do not have a god. As such It doesn't happen. You can eat anything if you are a god If you are engrossed in me then the god is for you Will meet. Sadhna with Do You Feel That Diet It gets affected. See, this doesn't happen to me It happened till today. Ok? There is such a thing as any not the one to whom you give too much priority I will give. Ok? It will affect your sadhana. What Why Should We Just Talk About Food? Ok? If you do deep meditation and If your phone is important to you, then it Even the phone will distract you from your sadhana. A Knock on the Door Can Like Green Your Meditation And If You Think Your Meditation Is Very Importent. Like you did Kriya Yoga Is. So this is taught in Kriya Yoga that even if a mosquito bites you it doesn't Affect you. And they never talk about food. Give Talk about Sadhana. Isn't it? so the more you Create a distraction. You for yourself you set it that if I do this then it will happen Will not done. If I do this it won't happen will be. If I do this then this will not happen. Now People say that it is tamasic food, There is food. Ok? then you will eat satvik food Then your mind will remain pure. so what does that mean That means as much crime is happening right now He is 100% non vegetarian What? Isn't it? That is why it means tamasic food by doing more good work Are they all vegetarian? As such What is it? Is there any such buffering system in the world? Isn't it? So what are you eating? It might change your mind about it Meaning your idea is weak. Ok? They Getting affected by anything. Meaning You are saying that meditation and chanting of mantras so much We are such powerful weapons that actually no one It is not affected by any thing. No effect It happens. But if your mind is inside your heart I have such doubts, self-doubts, then maybe It might be affected. See in Sanatana Dharma By eating these five things you can follow Sanatana Dharma go out of Are. So let me tell you one more thing now. 99.999% people are outside Sanatan Dharma. because what are the things that mean who These are the things that you eat They are excluded from Sanatan Dharma. So garlic Onion fine mushrooms. Ok? Pork and a I can't remember the item right now. But Garlic, onions, mushrooms. Mushrooms mean Vegetarians can also eat it. Isn't it? and this There is pork and cow. So all of these things By eating this you are out of Sanatan Dharma Let's go. When we talk about Sanatana Dharma Isn't it Sanatan Dharma is not confined to Humans. Sanatana Dharma which is of the Gods It is for animals and also for humans. All knowledge was given to humans in some part That which he can understand. Let us take the Mahabharata The epic is our history book. When Vyasa wrote the Mahabharata, so It was finished in 24,000 verses. He The one who was there for Rs 24,000 was the main principal. After reading it, anyone can understand Mahabharata. can't do it. then it was added to History. So it became a history book and then The Mahabharata which we read consisted of 1 lakh verses Are. But this Rs 1 lakh that was given to us Yes, this is a lesson from the Mahabharata. which is complete Mahabharata is available for the gods. It is not meant for humans at all. that's why There are a lot of things that we People have been told as a rule. Because it is beyond our understanding to understand it Is. An obvious question is that then that rule where is the book? Why didn't you give it to me in my childhood? Is this rule book gone? because the man that can not understand. But what about humans For which she can never be available? yes It can. In our Vedas, there is mention of Yajnas The number and method of Yagya has been explained. If In a number you can read that Veda and If he performs the yajna then you will be free from the human they become gods. So, humans have to The path to becoming a god in life was given Is. So if you follow him and become a god If you go, it is available for you. I am Thinking about how Sanatan Dharma has progressed for centuries increased? because we have been here for centuries No. We have been around for many clever ages. We have been here for many eons. We will never end It did not happen. We are infinite, aren't we? of Sanatana What does it mean? Which has been going on since the beginning. We understand this in a very normal way Are. Now there was Gandhi. Ok? Mahatma Gandhi Were. how do you know about them Are? By reading. You haven't seen it. Is No? even when the end of mankind comes The gods live. Ok? Like we told you told that when Shri Ram was crying When he is wandering in the separation from his wife At that time, Mahadev was in the jungle, only Ram Katha I was listening. Ok? And even earlier people knew the Rama Katha which still going. Ok? So that time loop the concept is not that time is stagnant and We are changing stations. it This is told in every story of Sanatan Dharma. Ok? So our guardians are above us The ones sitting here are gods. time is Stagnant and we are changing stations. Wow Meaning what was happening 2000 years ago is happening now It is also happening somewhere. Cycle of Birth And the same character. she body yes. may be some Another soul but the story remains same. you this Do you believe that you are in the same family? Rebirth happens. It is possible this would have been Is. People who helped us create our first podcast I haven't seen them, even a little It is necessary to provide contact. you know the same horror The theme was podcasts. Yes, I remember. And From somewhere it became Bhoot versus Bhairav. Correct. Then talk of Tantra started coming up. And After that chapter, the path of Tantra is known as the path of the gods. I have to go to Sanatan Dharma. I have to go. I I will tell you what I think about this chapter Why am I talking now? we are my life whatever happened in the last three months Nor do I think that anything is as big as this The two also had paranormal conversations He has had some effect over the years. And Because of that maybe from now on we will have Reduce Paranormal Conversations on the Show. And Talk More About Tantra Tantra or Actually I wanted to talk to you because your also switch on at some level same thing happened But the question to you is that now at some point In your spiritual journey I am sure that Have you known Maa Kali, we are at least I will have to go, I don't know if I have worshipped Have you done it? Do you worship this Maa Kali? Compare the worship with that chapter when you deal with the oakley trail were staying. There is some linkage between oral trials and In the middle of Mahakali? C of Paranormal Research if we talk then it is a very dangerous state and let me tell you something that if that is called sado science then there There are reasons for it. Ok? because literally when If we do paranormal research then we R beating the bush. something we didn't know What is in front is not there. Ok? But paranormal research pushed me to come inu sadhna route. So once we investigate somewhere Were doing it and that investigation is over And the second day I came to know that I had a cut Mark on my thigh. and that was the cut mark That was painless. He didn't use pen. From there our team decided that no, we People we should go inu tantra way. Correct Is? And then why does it happen little by little? Because you're not in paranormal research Taught how to deal with entities. Ok? So One is to go on the path of sadhana even earlier There was curiosity. what is the second if you will have to go on the path of sadhana, then that get you into it any way you can that you have to come. Who brings it? the deity you have been a devotee of, the one you have been worshipers. Ok. so some incident happened in your life because of which you understood or not let's figure out what we are dealing with what is the religious way out This is what you mean in paranormal have equipments you can like that feel something So it is happening but in this tantra way you can see what is happening this has happened with me I know ok when mommy casts an evil eye or someone else also take your eyes off me, what is actually happening happens if a very negative person Whose thoughts are very negative. He always thinks negatively It is about the people. such negative people why thoughts manifest very quickly Is. Very quickly. Like when on the path of sadhana If you move forward then I will tell you It will be told by your teachers that you should speak less. Ok? What else? Think less. think less in What? Think less negatively about yourself. You If sadhana is on the path and you know about yourself He will immediately think of negative things Manifest does. You are something in your life It is going to be positive. You think about that I am negative, it is like a straight line The work that is to be done will be done in 10 parts. Correct Isn't it? in the same way that negative people There are those who were earlier called witches. meaning not a witch like not a Wiccan but a witch who They used to say it. So basically if he looks at you And don't think anything negative about you So your energy meaning is called metaphysics You assume that this is a theory of metaphysics that the saw that is around you is yours There is a field in which their energy shapes and mixes it happens and once that energy is in your If he comes inside then he will tell you according to his wish Then it means your thinking, your physical structure If it changes it then what do we do When the bushes fall, what things do they use to shed them? Are? They fall with lemon. It is acidic. So whatever that unwanted energy is, it will go away from that It goes out. Ok. Can one ward off evil eye by worshipping goddess? Can it be taken off? by herself who is the goddess The seekers are not affected by evil eye. why is this There is an armor form. Yes. any goddess By the practice of. By worshipping any goddess. Sadhana of Bhairava. Absolutely. of any deity You should do sadhana. If you worship God If you are doing it well then that God is yours live with. protects the seeker from external attacks One should not avoid one's own attacks too much. Ok? what happens to a seeker When everything in life seems to be going so well isn't it then he starts thinking that this is this things are going well and these things are happening Otherwise, this problem may occur in our life It can. It would be better if it doesn't happen. But as soon as the seeker thought about himself did he manifest those things in your life even in the slightest form She returns. So this means a lot to a seeker It definitely happens with every seeker. what you Negative Thoughts: Have you ever thought that Manifest will do it. Positive also manifests Will do it. Maybe this is also a human truth. But Manifestation of your thoughts by doing sadhna Ability is high. It becomes too much. That is why just like we perform havan here, when Do not open your mouth when havan is performed in Aghor It happens. they don't talk even if you need something No, you tell me in gestures to bring that Bring it. you can't say a word every word that This is set during Aghor Sadhna Havan It will be manifested. about someone Don't think bad. about someone Don't say anything bad. And you were right. These It happens for common people as well. a lot of people come we have that our work is absolutely It gets spoilt while being created. These were the people Are you the one who thinks negatively about yourself? Are. If any work is going to be done then its you will think about it 10 times if this happens So this work will not be done. That means absolutely 100% yes, this work has to be done. But Than They Will Think That if this happens then it will not happen. It will happen. Everything they think about themselves. now that It gradually manifests. things stop It starts in life. One more life I would like to say career oriented thing here. I Think 99% of people are watching this podcast. They also have materialistic goals Are. Often I have seen that those who are Those who worship Shakti, Those sons have some materialistic There are definitely quotas. doesn't mean that the Devotion is not there. Worship with devotion We do. What can we take from this career guidance Can you? From Bhairav, from Shakti. Look, this is a topic that people don't understand yet A lot of people who are young right now are getting it Everyone is becoming a sanyasi after completing their studies Are. Ok? and according to them if he worship goddess or gods in this way If they worship then they have the path It will be paved soon. People think like this don't they that you wore a red dress, you wore a yellow dress You have worn the clothes, you have worn the fallen clothes If you take it then you become a great devotee. And if you If you are wearing a shirt then you are a small devotee Are. And you told me this last time too asked if material desires are a Is there hindrance in spiritual growth? Right? Something like that. No, it is not. this is the Plan of Mahamaya. Ok? we have such There have been saints who have been saints since childhood. In his childhood, he was given a Whatever is there in the ashram is given to them Mahamaya had decided that he would be a saint or someone who is in a very unconscious state He felt that he had to attain God. For him Mahamaya has decided and sent you to go now whatever this life of yours is You have to attain the gods. You Whatever it is, move away from this life. But the one who In the household religion, a person is his first The aim is that he should completely save the household live by it and only then what is What do you call that which is your own in religion? time should be given and to the gods who Keep the feeling you have and tell it to the gods You decide what is best for us Do it. ok to summarize a i think you are saying that a There is a path of human life. First you about yourself about your family I first think about my own comfort Attention should be paid to all things. and if Your heart desires to move forward in Sadhana I should request the daughter to Take me to that. the one who is your date will pave your way. all the same I will make arrangements. Let us assume 12 from today 10 years ago or when we only knew Durga Used to recite Saptashati. We knew a little about You will become a seeker. We have lived a life of our own began. I studied mass communication of. We worked in newspapers. We Worked at UNICEF and did whatever. Remained in politics for a few days. we never Did you know what we said? absolutely We will follow the path of religion. But the gods has turned our lives in such a way that we Came into the path of sadhana. and just as much as The more we pay attention to the gods, the more we Also pay attention to your household. Any But even if we are paying less attention to it Meaning we are not right with our religion because the first religion which we get We have to follow the Dharma of the household Is. Or else we should become sannyasis. Everything Leave it, don't do that, become a fugitive Needed Is it okay? Wood you say that the monk The core logic behind its creation is that We have to progress in our sadhana quickly. Meaning The core logic of speed remains. See now when you talk to the sannyasis Nor would those people make fun of this thing Are. Now, there is too much renunciation happening. If you ask the sanyasis why so many The number of sannyasis who are girl sannyasis is increasing He will tell you there are four types of sannyasis Are. Ok? First Sanyasis who do not wish to work, they become a sanyasi. do some work They keep getting food. Other sannyasis He who is suffering from the household, he is suffering from his wife Are you upset or are you troubled by your family members? He retires. The third monk who He has fled after committing a crime and has become a sadhu They go so that the police cannot catch them. And there is a very small section of Sanyas Ashram which is really just like nurturing the gods He retires for the sake of it. This is a very small There is a section that will be available No. The rest is meant for us Gurudev was a saint. He said what If it didn't happen to your family, it will happen to you. He said a big thing while laughing But you can understand what a big deal he is She said and even the sanyasis say this What? Not every sannyasi is such that you I should bow down and pay obeisance to him. Very little The Sanyasis are those who are from childhood. For them Looking at you, this feeling will come that is there. For them After seeing him you will understand that he is a sannyasi. Now we will talk about that timeline In. We are going to tell you about the timeline of the 10 Mahavidyas. Actually let's boil it down completely. Gin People have also heard about 10 Mahavid No, let's start from there. Good Chapter Zero I think it's a no. Very nice. Ok. See what is there about 10 Mahavidyas There is a lot of confusion in me. Ok. 10 This is true about Mahavidya. is mahavid Different chapters of knowledge or evolution of knowledge like the 10th avatar of the human it's about evolution in the same way Knowledge or enlightenment of your brain It is about him. but 10 great scholars one who understands where the origin of The thing is. He who knows that story Knows the importance of 10 Mahavidyas In life. Ok? Now we have named Durga I took Bhagwati’s. End of Durga Saptashati When I complete 13 chapters then Bhagwati says in the end that now my To kill the inaccessible demon And then I'll be Durga Durga I will tell you, understand that we have written 13 chapters I read Durga Saptashati and at last Bhagwati said now my name will be Durga when I It is about the timeline, I didn't He said, time is stagnant so first of all Bhagwati In that book the name was written as Durga It has happened. In the 13th chapter of that book, Bhagwati It says that when the Durgam demon is killed If I do it then I will be called Durga. This is the Durga It was from there that the 10 Mahavidyas emerged There came into being. of the inaccessible monster Arrival took place. It was very austere and inaccessible The demon took a boon from Lord Brahma that All the knowledge about the earth should come to me. Ok? So the inaccessible monster has the rest Apart from having knowledge, the four Vedas are also became his slaves. Ok? So the earth which Isn't it so? She has become disinterested in knowledge. Earth But there is no knowledge left and there is chaos Done. Meaning in Devlok everyone is like an animal Started doing it. Started living like animals. Complete Meaning that the entire creation is going to be destroyed Put. What will happen without knowledge? So the god who went to Brahma ji and said that you Has he given this boon? then goddess These people appealed to the same From the sources. Ok? and the Bhagawati Took the form of Durga. Ok? and Durga's After taking the form of Durgam, he killed the demon for 10 more goddesses apart from Durga An outbreak occurred. who together made the inaccessible Killed the demon. his his whole Destroyed the empire and all four Vedas I brought it back from them. So when he came back with the Vedas the knowledge which had vanished from the world Vidya had gone away, she has come back. that's why These are called Mahavidya. Vedas to the world Durga's 10 incarnations Appearance took place and Vedas were those 10 incarnations She brought it back and Gyan came back. that's why Mahavidya is okay, right? So black is the first one in that Tara then Tripura Sundari then Bhuvaneshwari Chinmastika Matangi. She is Matangi. Yes. After that Baglamukhi Is. Matangi is the ninth Mahavidya. so this There were different Mahavidyas. So Kali's work is to give birth as I told you. Tara's The job is to impart knowledge. in a person's life of their hearts and minds What is the role of these 10 Mahavidyas inside? In a human journey. 10 Mahavidya Sadhak's When you do sadhna in life and Bhagwati If you do sadhna of this then you will get knowledge of all the ten Mahavidyas One has to live. Ok? So black is black What is? Kali with Mahadev of Mahakal She sits together. He is fierce. Ok? and two more It is extreme. one black and one Of Tripura Sundari. Both are black. As We know Kala Bhairava and Gora Bhairava. We Similarly, one of them is black and the other is white Is. Is it okay? So Kali when you meditate When Kali comes into the area and casts her eyes on you If you read it, you are born in the system. Ok? Then you come to the second stage. Yes, Tara is coming. Tara's job is for you Cutting off past karmas. Ok? Who You have knots to cut and you will gain knowledge Give. Is it okay? then come in third Ah Tripura Sundari. which means all three It is considered the most beautiful among the people. He You have the most beautiful looks and the most beautiful mind They give. Ok? Then comes Bhuvaneshwari. She expands that opulence. Chinmastika comes again and what you have till today Learning destroys it. Isn't it a beheading? Whoremastika. The fierce Chandika has raised her neck Cut it off. So what do they say there? It destroys your ego. Then Bhairavi comes who is your enemy It destroys him. Yours in the first I have destroyed your ego Mastika cut off the head and then Bhairavi came And they destroyed everything else. Correct Is? then in the same order as Yes, Dhumavati is coming. that too of destruction Devi and Baglamukhi come. Dhumavati to you It revives and the one who is Baglamukhi determines that whatever elements are around you These are the things that prevent you from becoming a successful seeker now May they be destroyed. That is the final stage. Then Matangi comes. Matangi teaches you again She gives it. the knowledge that was lost when Chhin Mastika had broken you. Ok? And In the end comes Mahalakshmi Kamala who will bless you takes you back to the same glory you were in Were in the beginning. Ok? it is also called Garuda yoga They say. What is of the eagle which is of the phoenix it is a concept or not it is the same concept that the eagle dies and rises again He is alive. so in human life This Garuda Yoga brings you great height will stay and then fall again Will get up. or who will rise a second time then fall Does not happen. what am I not able to do in office should keep? do you think its negative energy because i have had a Kali worshipper come and He said hey the skull is of Kali We are my favourites but I don't know especially after this face I don't keep such things How do you feel? Are they affecting you? Am I not affected by these decorations? I feel like I'm not affected yes that's it it doesn't affect so it's about what you put into art basically it is a Art hum that's how I look at it. yes it is everything will start affecting in your Life. Then it will become difficult to live. We every You will keep thinking about the thing. From this This is happening to me, that is happening to me. Each person has his own interpretation Is. The head of Bhagwati Kali is the favourite Is. There is nothing like that. Yes. Ok. When Kali does Tantra Sadhna No, then we would have given Kali a seat on our heads Are. It has a prescribed format that In this way you bring that head. Whatever ghost is there then it would be invoked and then we place Bhagvati on top of it Are. That's all the head is used for. Ok shaved nothing that needs to be shown or are you on the wrong path of wandering There are three seekers. it had a skull Is. So the one who is Kapalika is made from skulls He does sadhana. This is called skull. So Cranial activities take place. one is the skull Not the rituals which are performed on dead bodies. There are skull operations in which All powers are surrendered. Means it Just like we use memory cards now Yes, it is kept in that manner. all sadhanas are offered there and goddess above him The ka is established. Therefore, the skull It is important. Ok. But this is obviously not an actual skull. These Maybe it's made of POP, I don't know from what? Is. But because it is made in this shape Because of this the energy gets affected. any of the Cheese does not have an energy effect on you Apart from the mind of. no the same veg non veg one The logic is the same that eating it does not have any effect could you mean any material like that There can be no interest or no interest. we our Guruji is the one who taught us so much when we were beginners When we were in the period of sadhana then we By looking at this one could understand the Tantra of the path There is a person. because it's all in our hands Something was always tied. Something used to be tied here. Used to wear garlands. So they asked me why are you doing this so much do you wear it? So we told them that this is us Wear it for your protection. This is ours It is an amulet. You should assume that. So he He said that this is not the talisman of a seeker. of the seeker This is the amulet. where a seeker sits There is no negative energy there Needed So if you are wearing it yourself then What will you protect the rest of us from? What Will you meet the powers that be? so today is that day It is the day of. We don't wear anything that that from the security point of view Be important. The same way we treat everyone Should become a talisman. Ok? external Energy: Nothing can disturb you. You should be that strong. The seeker especially He has so much faith in his Guru and the East It should be that when they are there then no one can control us Energy that is not work will do it. Stay safe. no different for him There is no need to recite the mantras. What does Maa Kali want from her devotees? Mother Kali wants this from her devotees May you attain nirvana sin. you everything Learn to do so. Everyone should understand this. Ok? that's why Maya's job is to take you to Mahadev Go. Maya was born in this game in order to create so that the living beings who are souls Nor could he understand what their purpose was. So as long as they are given different tasks, today's language I speak. that task will not be done Until then he will not understand what is not Is. What is the balance of the universe? So the goddess Kali's only purpose is to make you will take you to the path from where you can reach Mahadev It should reach till. I love them very much has increased a lot lately we mean If I get a little emotional right now I I will start crying that much I am feeling affection we are with them so I will not talk to them more about that attachment when we When sadhana started we became Tara He was practicing Maha Vidya but Tara we were not able to prove it okay so We just talked about Guruji, right? Then he gave us a mantra of Kali and that Only by mantras and not by miracles in my life Interview It happened and when we caught Kali then Tara we were also able to catch us and Then our journey continues till Bhairav ​​ji remained. Five of its 10 Mahavidyas of this from Tantra and the rest from Sri Vidya Completed the sadhana. Explain that when the mother What happens when Kali comes into your life? So Bhagwati Kali, that is birth, that is time and Black darkness, great void, everything is right from there If we start, then we start with Bhagwati Kali only Tantra also started when for the first time something did not understand that we were doing something If you come into Tantra Sadhna in the beginning then You won't understand anything for three-four years So it is blank, you won't feel anything, why? we are not able to understand any difference you will become a bit aggressive which means They say there is some value addition in life do not seem. v is why it's not too Enjoy the process. Yes yes, just enjoy it. So when I was doing sadhna of Kali Bhagwati then For the first time I felt that our The mantra is awakening or our goddess Is with me. We had gone to a place to perform havan. So That too was a Nath family. But to us he There was a little enthai. So there was a pyre. over there The havan was being performed. So those people have a lot of The material was collected and kept. Us We were invited to perform havan but we The material was not provided. Gave very little. so he If you were doing your havan then you were doing havan So they are throwing one material after another into the pyre Were. But the pyre was not burning. that means That doesn't happen. very last stage water Had been. And a lot of the fuss that happens is smoking It happens that he threw it away. nothing he It wasn't burning at all. So we had our Kali mantra there of. When our Gurudev said something If you don't have it then you can pick up some soil and perform havan Do it because everything belongs to God. those It is made of. That is the five elements. Your Is it all tasty or tasteless for them That's it. So what did we do that Bhagwati's Took the mantra. He picked up the ashes from there and buried them on the pyre We sacrificed ourselves thrice and that pyre was burnt got up. So we thought that yes, that means Bhagvati is our and for the first time I realised that Tantra we are doing or learning There is something in it. So it took a lot of time. Goddess Bhagwati has blessed us very much. very often It seemed like I should give up now. Tools We used to do it a lot. in our house our The room is at the end and our Dad was also about to go to our room at that time. They were afraid. But then slowly Bhagwati told everything Some things were resolved. Then Tara Mahavidya I. Thara was interviewed in life. Then the eye of knowledge opened. Then Bhairava came. Then The worship of Chin Mastika Baglamukhi Bhairavi We did it. Then from the entire Shankaracharya Mahabhag We took initiation and then their Bhuvaneshwari and Tripura Maritime and five Colleges I practiced his sadhana. That sequence is ongoing right now Used to be. A friend of mine in my building Is. He found a devi mantra online. And Asked me to do this. I said yaar I Don't know honestly. and it's not my right to give you the meaning because I meant it I haven't even practised. we are these I said now it's not my right, is that The Correct Way of Looking at Things. Yes yes. first of all You should get a month from a Guru family. One The mantra should come to you from the guru tradition. And your Guru has to be given authority by his Guru You should be able to pass on this mantra Are. Only then are you eligible to cast the spell. Otherwise there are many mantras available. Correct Is? and if you read it you might You may suffer loss. anything can happen to you No. Ok? its not good with you Can. Yes. Why can't it happen? Because it is as good as a poem. Or The mantra of cheating that you don't have the right to It is like a poem. You just read it For him. I told you a story, right The Englishman who met a saint in Benares To take the Gayatri Mantra. The saint refused Given that you are English then I am not Give. The Englishman had money. he is someone And went to the Acharya. From that, Gayatri Mantra Took it. He came and told the saint that he had This is the Gayatri Mantra. So the saint said you Recite the Gayatri Mantra. so he heard it from Om Gave. So the saint recited this Gayatri Mantra Not there. The British thought that we had left. He He went back to his teacher and said that the saint I am saying that what you said is There is no Gayatri Mantra. Then Acharya jumped having done this he came to the saint and said, we have our He told the disciple that this is not the Gayatri Mantra Is. So he said no. then he said to the disciple tell me. Then the disciple recited the Gayatri mantra. So you pronounced it literally correct. So Acharya said this is Gayatri Mantra. Saint He said this is not Gayatri Mantra. Then The religious assembly of Banaras met to decide this For and when the religious assembly of Banaras sat Then the Englishman recited the Gayatri Mantra again. The Mantra Dharma Sabha said that he narrated it correctly The saint said that this is not Gayatri The religious assembly said the mantra that Saint Sahab We too know this Gayatri Mantra Are. So he said you guys have the right are received. So when you read this, it This is the Gayatri Mantra. the rights you receive he is not a person if he chants the gayatri mantra If he reads it then it is not considered as Gayatri Will go. in the same way if you do anything, looking up mantra yantra or tantra online without any Guru who has the right to If not, then it becomes invalid. It doesn't make any sense. Then the Psalms What happens? You can source it. All of them are praises, all of them are hymns, all of them can you read. Devotion increases. yes joe is a must. Yes. the gods were pleased It is from him. Like if a normal person is called a goddess If you want to worship then buy Durga Saptashati Take. There is a chapter on Durga in the name of Namaavali Durgati Shamani Durga Pad Nivarani Durgham Chedni Fort Shani Fort Nashani Fort Dhani Durgani Durmapa Durgam Gyaada Durdaitya Lok Dawla Durgama Durmaka Durma Swaroopani Durmap Prada Durgam Vidya Durma Durgam Knowledge Institute Durgamani Durma Durgamaga Durma Swaroopani Durma Shivshant Durmadharani Durmangi Durmata Durma Durd Durg Bhima Durbhama Durbha Durdhani has 32 names so this is the name given to it You can chant it every day but you don't have the right Even then you can chant it when you wake up You can chant this also. Due to this, Bhagwati She feels very happy. We who worship the Goddess He can start with this. What is the difference then? In which? The mantras and In the Psalms. One is a president, right? It is the grace of Bhagvati that you are like this Bhagvati you They are like this. They It means magnification. That is a prayer. Ok? And what is the mantra? it's a vibration which the sages and saints had given to us which has been created by doing it in a correct way Our spiritual growth takes place. we are that If it is not done properly it It can also make you imbalanced energy wise And mentally too.
