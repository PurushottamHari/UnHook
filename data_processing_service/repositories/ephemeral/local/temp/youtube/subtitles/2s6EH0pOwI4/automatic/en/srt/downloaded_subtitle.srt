1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
Brahma Bhairavaya Namah Brahma Bhairavaya Namah

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,600
Connections have increased in the last three months

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,679
Are. It is visible. See, life never

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
It does not move linearly. in the life of a human being

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,559
This is Garuda Yoga. Garuda dies and

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,000
He becomes alive again. that you are of perfect height

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
I will stay in after that I will fall after that again

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,880
Will rise from. These who will rise a second time

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,720
Don't fall. I get lost a lot. Any 

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,400
You are also worshipping that god. a time like this

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,599
comes you can feel that god

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,560
You are coming with us. Brother when mom looks at me

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,880
Does it take off or is anyone taking your sight away?

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,559
what would have happened

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,800
Is? These ten Mahavidyas in a person's life

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,760
What is the role of? in tantra way

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,320
It is said that if you do sadhna of Bhagwati Tara

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,840
If they do, Mahadev comes running after them

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
Are. Do you believe that in one family

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
You are reborn. It could be this

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,680
It happens. may be some other soul but the story

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,600
Remains the same. How has Sanatan Dharma progressed for centuries?

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,480
increased? Because we are never finished

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,359
happened. even when the end of mankind comes

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,359
gods live

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,680
Are. Very deep spiritual conversation

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,159
Is. The title of the last episode was Bhoot Vs.

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,200
Bhairava. There was talk of horror, talk of Tantra

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,159
Hui. But in today's episode it's not very deep.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,080
Spiritual things have happened. If Sanatana Dharma

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,240
The Tantric secrets of Sanatan Dharma

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,280
Tantric secrets and Sanatan Dharma

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,000
If you want to identify a Tantric medium then

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,079
Watch this episode till the end. maybe one day

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,880
The world of podcasts will not exist. Any

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,600
Won't listen to podcasts. But even then it is not like that

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,079
These are spiritual episodes that bother people a lot

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I will teach you something. Guide people too much

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,439
We will do it because of people like Shishir Kumar.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
don't want to say too much about him other than

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,880
the fact that this is not one of my favourites

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,360
Guests are to speak to learn from.

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,960
Enjoy today's episode. Many more

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,320
There have been talks about Sanatan Dharma,

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,520
About spirituality and about life.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,520
Watch it till the end.

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:16,979
[music]

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,720
Shishir sir has returned. Bhram Bhairavaya Namah

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,720
Bhram Bhairavaya Namah Thank you for being in the

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Studio again sir. Thank you to us too

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,680
To call. How are you? I am fine.

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,920
Where to start? where last time

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,640
Bhairav ​​had left it. ok or ten mahavidya bhagavati

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,519
Where you start from. ok maybe from bhairav

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,920
Let's start. Ok. Whatever this happened

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,319
What do you think about the past three months?

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,560
Was? because i remember the first or the second

58
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,959
I received a message from you the other day. you said that

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,840
Bhairav ​​ji is with you. Basically you did this

60
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,120
Said. hum hum to would just like to know

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,760
Because I haven't talked to you outside.

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,519
Now when you were sitting in front of me for 10-15 minutes

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,360
I did not talk about it then. So tell me now. When

64
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:10,159
You are in sadhana when you are a seeker

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,879
If you are, then two things happen in your life.

66
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,959
One is a power in your life which

67
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,879
Isn't it, she is always there? Are you a seeker or

68
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,920
No it is not so. it has some powers

69
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,560
which is negative. Ok? but he

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,680
It lives with you as a parasite and

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,000
It brings benefits. When you begin to meditate

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,000
If yes, then remove these powers from your life.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,599
Does matter. So he creates all kinds of intrigues

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,799
that you feel that the gods and the

75
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,440
This is sadhana, both of these are wrong for us. And

76
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,080
will bring you into such a situation that you

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,799
One should completely turn away from the practice. just like that

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,840
Something happened to you. But you stood firm and

79
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,680
If you trusted in Sadhana and God then God

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,000
Whatever Mahamaya's deception was to you

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,959
Kicked him out. This is a topic.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Second is that in sadhana you have to learn

83
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:07,120
Is. then you won't make mistakes and you will learn

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,599
How? Everybody makes mistakes and

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:15,200
Mahamaya makes it happen. and you have a little

86
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,959
I made a mistake. It was your narrator's mistake, who said

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,600
Do people make personnel mistakes?

88
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,000
This is what we do. Ok? I have a

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
Read about the topic recently. That

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,680
The name of the topic is Ego Death. we we are one

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,160
It is an English word. Ego means self

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,600
Identification of who I am, what am I?

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
Who am I? What have I done?

94
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,800
What can I do? We think of all that

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,360
He passed away. we their death we

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
My ego died especially in that one week

97
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,800
which was the first week we we because

98
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,479
We were threatened with violence in our childhood

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,560
I think I read a couplet by Kabir

100
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,360
Where basically they say that the one above

101
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,040
has so much power that he can put pressure on you

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,639
One can cause your ego death by pulling a hair from

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,440
Is. It can bring an earthquake into your life.

104
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,000
That is why it is very important to be humble and polite

105
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
Is. I just remembered that couplet that friend

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,919
Everything was fine three-four days ago. then this

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,240
There was an earthquake. See, life never

108
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,120
It does not move linearly. go in the flow like this

109
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,840
Does not happen. and if your life is a torrent

110
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,000
If I follow you will neither be able to learn anything nor

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,759
There will be happiness in life. Until and Unless You

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,360
have

113
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:37,440
Challenges till then you have this courage to live

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,120
The purpose is that it ends. If suppose

115
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,360
linear running you are enjoying life bus

116
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
It is going on, it is going on. Come on look at you seeker

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,720
I talked about this and not about what happens in the life of a seeker

118
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,520
It happens? Why does it happen so quickly? As

119
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,720
A normal person who sells groceries

120
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,720
does the shop. He goes in the morning and evening

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,800
I close the shop and have a family

122
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,919
Life goes on. there is something very much in it

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,160
It doesn't happen. If there is a lot of it in the house,

124
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,000
There will be some fights but that is the life which

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,039
begins his life the way he ends it

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,360
It happens. When a seeker lives his life

127
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,680
Neither does he start acquiring knowledge.

128
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,919
Ok? And when you acquire knowledge,

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,800
If you are learning then it is according to your nature

130
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,639
It comes as per calculation. When your knowledge gradually

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,960
When the eye opens then there are ten great scholars

132
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,440
He starts showing you his different side.

133
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,199
She does. You start with black

134
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,120
The great void remains. you give me some ideas

135
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,919
Not there. But you have it all inside you. To you

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,680
I don't know anything. then the second stage knowledge

137
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,560
It comes in which Tara comes. Tara to you

138
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,479
It gives knowledge. Ok? The third stage comes

139
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,800
It is of Tripura Sundari. Tripura Sundari who

140
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,039
Yes, it develops the brain. Fourth Stage

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,000
Bhuvaneshwari's comes. Bhuvaneshwari arrives

142
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,400
So it gives wealth. Then Bhairavi comes

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,800
What is Bhairavi? She destroys enemies

144
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,280
It is around you. So you become supreme.

145
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
After that which rotates in a sequential manner

146
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,560
comes and this goddess who comes, Banglamukhi

147
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Here comes, they are goddesses of destruction. So

148
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,520
All the empires that you have built will be lost

149
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,599
One by one they collapse. And finally

150
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,759
Who is coming? Kamala, great glory, great knowledge.

151
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,680
Ok? So these are the stages which are 10 Mahavidya

152
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,160
It happens to a seeker's life 10

153
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,160
This is Mahavidya. Meaning, if you practice

154
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
If you start, a timeline will also start

155
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,800
goes. A timeline starts with you

156
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,800
goes. And you see, the order is 10

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
Maha Vidya which is written in a sequence

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,319
that after Kali, Tara and then Tripura Sundari

159
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,039
then Bhuvaneshwari then Tripura Bhairavi and finally

160
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,120
The order in which Lakshmi comes is not like this

161
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,840
It has been written. this is the order it is exactly

162
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,639
It happens according to the life of the seeker. And

163
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,680
what is in your life right now what does it say

164
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,479
If you are around the fifth Mahavidya then you

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,720
You too will definitely be cured. Your

166
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,400
the people around will also be cured so that

167
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,759
the costume of a seeker which is a costume

168
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,319
I mean it's not clothes, it's the eternal gown

169
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,479
When you wear it, Mahalakshmi is with you

170
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,240
If it comes, are you ready for it?

171
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:09,759
Let's go, okay, see, there is God too

172
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:13,360
Even gods are not free from mistakes.

173
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,919
All gods make mistakes. so that like Maya

174
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,639
I just told you about Bhagwati. Each and every goddess

175
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,160
You will find such a story of God

176
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,879
In which mistakes were made. Lord Dattatreya

177
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,759
came into being because Lakshmi ji,

178
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,080
Parvati ji and Saraswati ji the three that you

179
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,640
When I talked about ego, his ego came to the fore

180
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,440
Was. Anusuya was so chaste that she used to hide her clothes

181
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,360
I did not bring water. so much their power

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,240
Was. So he said to Mahadev, Vishnu

183
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,120
to Ji and to Brahma ji that you people should go and

184
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,399
By breaking the sanctity of Anusuya

185
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Give it. So then they went to Anusuya.

186
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,519
Then Anusuya kept him as her child.

187
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
Took it. And then don’t leave them. So

188
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,880
The entire balance of the universe is disturbed

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
Done. Then the goddess had to come to Anusuya

190
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,200
Near. I apologized for the ego death you caused

191
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,279
and then the universe started moving the same way

192
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,760
Put. Is it okay? So you will get many such

193
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,839
You will get examples. so you can't live in the

194
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,320
Remotes that you did something. the point is you

195
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,720
You have learned and you should move on. Increased connection

196
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,720
have been done. Yes. That is visible. right now means

197
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
Sadhana is happening with even more devotion

198
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,160
Is. And even now it is happening with devotion

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,040
Was. Butt devotion on steroids. he started to be

200
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,040
Is. That I get lost in meditation. and I

201
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,720
have realized that that is the right way to do it

202
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,480
Sadhana. we we are absolutely. I with my

203
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,519
I tell people who are learning

204
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,279
that if you want to see Bhagwati, Bhairava

205
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you want to have darshan of Lord Shiva or any other deity?

206
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,519
You are worshipping. until madness sets in

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,920
Till then if you tie yourself to anything

208
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,040
have been. Whether it be an action, whether it be

209
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,360
Be it a garland. Ok? until you are in those things

210
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,680
Will remain stranded. when you get out of them

211
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
Only then you are able to pave the way for devotion

212
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,880
And the god takes one look and says yes this too

213
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Any

214
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,480
Is.

215
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:10,320
One change I have adopted is this

216
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,600
That means suppose I sit down to meditate

217
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,079
I sit in the morning. in the afternoon or evening

218
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,000
I sit and then I sit at night. But

219
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,760
In those three ah time periods if I

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,120
If I am not feeling the feeling of devotion then I get up

221
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,279
I go from there. do it right and during the day

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,079
You may feel it in one of the three time periods

223
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,399
it goes away at least at night but we are devoted

224
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,240
I do not sit down to do sadhana without it. Sadhana

225
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,000
walking with you on the path when you and

226
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,399
If you do sadhna then it will also happen that you will get many

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,440
You won't feel like doing sadhana for days.

228
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,920
Meaning, you will not feel like you

229
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
Do worship. There comes a time when you feel

230
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,640
may the gods be with us

231
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,399
Are. Ok? So at that time, the mantra is

232
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,360
Mantra is a vibration. So your power

233
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,680
When it is fuller than your body proportion

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,920
With the mantras you will feel that we are no longer worshipping

235
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,480
Do it. Now let us stop chanting for a few days.

236
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,160
When Swami Vivekananda was 34 years old

237
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,040
He told his brother that I

238
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,880
I will die in six years. They

239
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,920
Asked why will you die? so said

240
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,959
that our body does not accommodate this consciousness

241
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,120
I won't be able to handle it. so a very explosive

242
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,000
The situation will arise and this is what happened Vivekananda

243
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,360
He had many diseases. So this

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,839
It is true that if you always practice meditation and yoga

245
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,519
I don't have the desire to, I don't have the desire to chant

246
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,160
Is. so this is perfectly normal what does it mean

247
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,240
Your body is realizing how much it needs

248
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,240
How much worship to do, how much meditation to do,

249
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,279
How much to chant? sometimes something something

250
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,079
After chanting the mantras, a little

251
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,200
I start having a headache. and that would be a sign

252
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,680
That's ok stop at least for me. hardly

253
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,920
I have my own system.

254
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,320
The chakras must be balanced. If your sir

255
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,720
I am in pain that means the mantra

256
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,600
Yours is working. but your crown

257
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,440
The chakra needs a clearing. So by learning it

258
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,079
And the chakras should be cleared. But

259
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,040
How has it become unclean?

260
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,720
I mean how did Cloudy happen? Then he chanted

261
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,800
It happens, right? that's what I said, if you

262
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,279
He keeps on chanting and accumulates energy

263
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,600
It keeps happening. so either you use that energy

264
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,600
you help someone you do something for someone puja

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,519
do something or pray for someone

266
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,200
So that energy will be used. Its just you

267
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,760
If you keep accumulating then it will show it

268
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:29,120
Effect. My mentality is that right now

269
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,160
Whatever sadhna you have done, the power of that sadhna

270
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,079
I am starting some new things regarding

271
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,839
Now I am doing Beyond The on YouTube

272
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,399
podcast. Because I have learned a lot

273
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,959
In five to six years. There is a lot to do. We

274
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,600
We are obviously the world's largest economy for India

275
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,639
For this we also

276
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,720
so this outputting creative work this is right

277
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,880
There is a path of sadhana. You get whatever you want now

278
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,480
He is planning to leave it to his god

279
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Give it. You don't need mantra and sadhna for

280
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,600
Yourself. Whatever practice you are doing

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,600
There will be two fruits. One is that you have this knowledge

282
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,519
No, what I said is the cycle of 10 Mahavidyas

283
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,240
if you keep moving forward in that then that is

284
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,639
Very spiritual. To you in material life

285
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,680
What you need and what you can do

286
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,760
Leave that to god. Understand one thing. We

287
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,800
you can see your life only to the extent that

288
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,920
We have seen it till now. Are you understanding? mine which

289
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,880
There is exposure, I don't want to end my life there

290
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,519
I can see it. but god bless our life

291
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,519
I watch too much. So if we practice

292
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,040
and asking the gods to

293
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,519
we may have an X but we mean our

294
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,839
100X is written in my destiny

295
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,680
So we stop at X. that's why

296
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,200
Never ever do your sadhana rely on material things

297
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,360
You should not do it for this. don't even think

298
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,519
Needed If you are doing a thing then you assume that

299
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,760
Seems like the god wanted you to

300
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,120
do. If you are successful in that, that is also theirs

301
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,880
There is work. That's not your job either. Here

302
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,360
If failure was to happen then it wouldn't happen to you

303
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,920
Would bring it. A seeker should not be afraid of any such thing

304
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,199
Do not put any such thing which will fail. Antillean End

305
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,440
unleash it is a learning

306
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:11,760
Again. You just said one thing that

307
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,440
After the point, Devi also came into your life

308
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,199
In. After we worship Bhairava. We this

309
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,360
I told you about the timeline because I

310
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:24,320
I guess we didn't talk about it last time

311
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:27,120
I had curry it. Hmm. am i also feel that devi

312
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Pooja is less common in Mumbai. we we now

313
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,000
There is a lot of devotion among the people here. hmm

314
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,120
People are very career oriented in this city.

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,199
Mata ki chowki on us, goddess worship, goddess

316
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,399
These temples are rarely seen in Bombay.

317
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,320
When we go to North then we go to U C

318
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,360
It's more. More prevalent in the South

319
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,760
Is. It is also prevalent in the East. because of that

320
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,240
I have seen Devi only in the last 3-4 years

321
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,920
I have to go in. no up til then it's been

322
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,680
Ganpati Krishna Lord Shiva Hum Hum Bat Ye

323
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,760
It's not just my problem. I feel that

324
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,000
This is the problem of my entire generation. Plus

325
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,000
even online i noticed that definitely

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,440
There is a lot of content on Bhairava ji. Shiva

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,560
But there is too much content. Now on Bhairav ​​ji

328
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,680
Content Now After 2019 What We Can

329
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,760
Find. But initially Bhairava was a god.

330
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,800
I mean like when we started worshipping Bhairava

331
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,600
When we were kids, people looked at us as outcasts.

332
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Look, let me tell you a little about this

333
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
Keep the topic. Bhairava in our life

334
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,079
Had not come earlier. first in our lives

335
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,560
Bhagwati had come. We guys, you, yes, okay. Since childhood

336
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,959
what happened was that we, we, in our home,

337
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,000
Nana ji was the one who recited Durga Saptashati

338
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,720
Used to recite. And our job was to assist them

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,800
to do. So like now Durga Saptashati is going on

340
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,760
If so, burn incense there; the lamp is burning

341
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,160
keep watching, do all this and keep doing that

342
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,279
The Durga Saptashati which he used to recite I also

343
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,199
I kept remembering and along with it, I was with Bhagwati

344
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,320
One

345
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:56,320
I felt very connected. Correct

346
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,199
Is? When we came into the path of Tantra, the first

347
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,480
The initiation that we had was also Tara Mantra

348
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:05,120
It started from. So we asked Guruji that

349
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,079
Why are we starting with Tara Mantra?

350
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:14,160
So Bhagwati Tara is the motherly form.

351
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:18,720
When Mahadev drank poison in the form of a mother

352
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:21,839
During the churning of the ocean he swallowed the poison

353
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,920
I restrained myself and saved them from that havoc.

354
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,040
I was in a lot of pain. very jealous

355
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,800
Was. Then Mahamaya took the form of Bhagwati Tara at that time.

356
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,000
I came and Mahadev became a small child

357
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,759
And breastfed them. then from that milk

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,160
That jealousy of Mahadev stopped. So

359
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,639
In the Tantra path it is said that Bhagwati

360
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,759
If you do sadhna of Tara then

361
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,920
Mahadev comes running after him. Ok?

362
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,480
So our beginning was with Bhagwati Durga

363
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,920
By sadhana. Ok? worship whatever it is

364
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,360
It happened as per Durga Shapati. then tara and

365
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,600
We had a connection with Tarapitha. all this when

366
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,120
were doing it so we told you that one time

367
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,360
It came to pass that there was a great deal of money in our lives

368
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,679
There was a shortage. At that time we should do Tara Sadhna only.

369
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,079
Were living. So besides the Guru Mantra we have 10

370
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,160
Mahavid was doing sadhna of Tara and

371
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,760
Only Tara was visible to us. Ok? That

372
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,880
At that time we had also given up Durga Sadhna.

373
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,600
What was your age then? We have started Tara Sadhana

374
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,199
It was done in 2013 and we were born in 84

375
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,760
In.

376
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,760
29 This was it.

377
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:36,000
So in 2017 we had a Nathji in Rajasthan

378
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,000
meet. Nathji means one who belongs to Nath sect

379
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,080
coming. But what is there is not

380
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,559
The magician is Nath ji. which is very

381
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,720
People are Pandora. The meaning of Pandora

382
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,360
That they show you the tricks. people in it

383
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,760
They get stuck. What kind of tricks? So in the room

384
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,799
Shower me with notes. Ok? extract money from the ground

385
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,679
Give. So that was the way he used to work. Now

386
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,840
That Shivalok of Manohar is no more. So he

387
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,679
Once I met him, he told me

388
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,880
that whatever you are doing right now you need Bhairava

389
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,559
You should do sadhana otherwise you will lose your things

390
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,039
It won't be ok. I said why ok

391
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,559
Won't it be? So he said that it is Maya's work

392
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,720
To throw the seekers away. and who balances it

393
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,160
Is? Mahadev Shiv form balances it

394
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,080
In. Then he told me to do Bhairava Sadhna,

395
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,679
All these things are the method of Bhairav ​​Sadhana

396
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,120
Taught me. After that what happened was that the people there

397
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:35,120
Nath is there, he does sadhna on voice

398
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,200
Are. Meaning he doesn't say any words. they have

399
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,520
Some sounds. He doesn't even teach everyone.

400
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Ok? and the method that he described

401
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,400
But I have been doing sadhana for two-three years,

402
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,200
I did what was taught in Bali Pooja.

403
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:55,840
There was a desire to move beyond that. So

404
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,200
There was a sadhak who was a big name in Tarapith Kamakhya

405
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,640
was his Veernath

406
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Yes, if in modern India there is a very big

407
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,280
When the name of Aghori is taken then he is a doctor

408
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,360
Ramnath is an Aghori. And those who direct

409
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,000
The disciple was Veernath ji. So Veernath ji

410
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,080
When I met him, I started crying.

411
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,679
I had heard his name so much. He is in Ranchi

412
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,520
There is an ashram. yes it is. He is now deceased.

413
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,840
Shiva went to heaven in 125 years. So when

414
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,440
When we went to meet him, we went thinking that

415
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,760
We were thinking that we will take the mantra of Bhairava from him. Correct

416
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,039
Is? So we went to meet him. He was very happy

417
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,919
We sat together for five to six hours. Very

418
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,960
All kinds of things happened. Food happened, whatever happened

419
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,320
Happened. But we couldn't tell them that we

420
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,640
Please give me the Bhairav ​​mantra. Ok. say that mean

421
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,679
I couldn't even find it. There was no chance, no meaning

422
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,559
It felt appropriate to talk to him. a few days

423
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,360
Went again later. Then we sat for 5-6 hours

424
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,320
Couldn't speak. Well, your 5 and a quarter year old saint

425
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,240
if someone is sitting in front of you then you should wait 10 minutes before speaking.

426
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,919
I have to think many times whether I should say it or not

427
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,080
Speak.

428
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,000
Went again on the third day. On the third day we thought

429
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,760
I will speak today and then I will not be able to speak.

430
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,799
Meaning, I could not speak even though I wanted to. And we started to go

431
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,559
That okay Guru Maharaj, we are leaving. when we

432
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,559
As he came out of the gate he entered a small room

433
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:22,640
I used to sleep in a corner, so he said

434
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,360
that you will be able to handle Bhairav ​​if you ask a direct question

435
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,480
We said yes, we will handle this much

436
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,240
It is not easy to handle Bhairav, we are not

437
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,320
Gurudev will take care of it and after that very

438
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,520
Bhairav ​​temple in Ranchi miraculously

439
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,840
After the Bhairav ​​temple was built, Bhagwati's temple was built

440
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,640
The establishment of Bhagwati which was established

441
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,720
We have a place called Ramnagar in Bihar. There

442
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,960
By inviting Bhagawati from your own

443
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:54,240
is placed in place. and then there again

444
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,720
Durga Puja has begun. So the only one like that

445
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,120
It is Durga Puja which lasts for nine days

446
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,360
Durga is worshipped according to Tantra method. Now

447
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,039
So Durga Puja too is going to become extinct

448
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,520
Put. You are talking about here. I

449
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:09,760
I was watching Durga Puja here. So

450
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:13,080
It is said in the scriptures that whatever you have is different

451
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,679
We bring soil from this place and make Durga from it

452
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,960
The vigraha of Ka is created

453
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,799
The puja which goes on for nine days, I have seen it at many places

454
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,200
It was seen here that those POP statues were moving

455
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,000
It is like a thing in which life cannot come.

456
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,840
At our place too, the Kalash would be placed from the fourth day

457
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,679
Are. What is fundamentally religion now?

458
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,520
is coming back. I can say this. So

459
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,240
But in the last 20 years the entire religion has

460
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:40,720
Was destroyed. In the last 20 years, 202

461
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,360
in years yes since 2000 since 2000 approximately why

462
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,919
Our generation or those just before us

463
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,840
When that generation grew up, they were separated from religion

464
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,320
There was not much attachment. We mostly live in India

465
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,720
Wasn't it a place for displaced people?

466
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,120
Everyone left their village and came somewhere to earn money

467
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,960
have been. So those who are coming to earn, their first

468
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,799
The aim was that their child should also study

469
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,760
Whatever I have, I started earning. Ok? So the one who is

470
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,520
Religion requires mental stability

471
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,000
He is the Maximum India's to follow

472
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,240
It was not there. Well, on the side where this stability was

473
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,799
Where the displacement is less

474
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,400
There, religion is going on as it is.

475
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,120
But in North India and wherever you see

476
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,600
that modernization is where factories are built

477
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,760
The religion there was completely destroyed.

478
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Now the AP center of Durga Puja is Kolkata

479
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,320
Is. So many days for the communists in Kolkata

480
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,280
It remained a secret. the government system that is still in place

481
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,200
It is very secular. So that is also the goddess's

482
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,960
They make it secular. without weapons

483
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,120
is worshipped. Isn't it? So this is going on.

484
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,799
So when Durga was worshipped in our place

485
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,880
So when we used to see it, we felt

486
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,080
No, there should be such worship at a place where

487
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,400
But the whole method is as per the rules and regulations

488
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,240
Should be worshipped? So for the past six years now

489
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,679
Now Durga is being worshipped in our temple

490
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,960
Is. Right or wrong way to worship

491
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,280
Where is it written? The first topic we

492
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,720
That puja is done in two ways. Agamas and

493
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,760
Corporation. This is one way, which is Tantra path. So

494
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,799
In the path of Tantra, the book of Tantra path

495
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,039
are you to him

496
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:19,280
Study under some guru and

497
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,080
Understand it and then do it. that tantra path

498
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,159
Worship is done with it. The second Vedic law

499
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,280
There is a scriptural rule for worship, right?

500
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,159
We and you don't have to do that puja.

501
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,960
His simple principle is that you

502
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,760
Call him. You can only be a host to it

503
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,360
Are. You cannot perform the puja on your own. So

504
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
don't put your mind to it at all

505
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
That is how puja should be done. means you

506
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,400
You are saying that puja is mostly done in everyone's house

507
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,840
It happens to us which our mother always does

508
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,400
We will actually do that by bringing a Pandit.

509
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,679
We don't need those who worship at home

510
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,080
Yes, that is tantric worship, okay, that is Vedic

511
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,120
It is not everyone's matter who is in everyone's house

512
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,280
People also worship lord Krishna

513
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,760
Absolutely respectful of duty

514
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,679
Because as soon as you come to Panch Puja

515
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,240
If yes then it is a Tantric puja. What

516
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,640
Is Panch Puja performed? Panch puja means you

517
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,919
You lit the incense stick in front of the deity

518
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,320
You lit the fire, you offered it to them

519
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,320
You offered sandalwood to him and offered flowers to him

520
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,880
You offered these five things to this Tantrik

521
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,600
The method is in the Vedic method of worship that

522
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,640
You will light the havan and perform it, is that okay?

523
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,320
Just this, as soon as you performed the Panch Puja

524
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,799
does it mean that you are a tantrik

525
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,320
Worshiping as per the method. Ok. Are you

526
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,960
saying that most of the people especially this

527
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,440
We are still listening to that podcast

528
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,600
have I ever worshipped in my life

529
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,000
He has already used the system.

530
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,039
they're doing it, they're doing it. you kept the defiance

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,600
If you take it then the idol is a device. Hmm. You

532
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,039
Keeping the yantra and chanting mantras along with it

533
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,080
If you are pronouncing it then you are doing tantra

534
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:58,559
Are. And now in the coming years we will be

535
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,200
The high level will be in an advanced version

536
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,159
In our country. Yes. This is a fight.

537
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,559
Absolutely. So home

538
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:09,520
You can advance while sitting

539
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:13,840
On the path of Tantra. This is what we are saying to you. Yes.

540
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,559
Ok. But you talked about Durga Puja

541
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,559
you said i think what i understood

542
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,960
When you worship Shakti, that is worship

543
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:27,679
It is a little fiery, a little aggressive

544
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:30,960
And such fierce worships were probably not there 100 years ago

545
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,760
200 years ago we were very normal in India

546
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,320
But now she has become normal a lot because

547
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,000
of British Rule etc. in which case

548
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:44,799
Our country had different factors. but that

549
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,440
Everything will come back now. We just now worship that fiery

550
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,279
Let's talk a little bit about it. we came

551
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,760
No, now we will know a little about the practice of sacrifice.

552
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,000
I will talk to you. Let’s start from there

553
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,480
Because this is an internet friendly topic.

554
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,799
Look at this Tantra Shastra. Ok? on that

555
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,520
There is no point in debating. You

556
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,679
You will see that those who oppose the practice of sacrifice

557
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,799
Those people are calling themselves Vaishnavs

558
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,840
Are. Ok? And since he is a Vaishnav

559
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,320
They feel that you should not make sacrifices. Ok?

560
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,760
Because he is a vegetarian. Mr Karpatri

561
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,480
Maharaj it is okay that at the last moment of the religious assembly

562
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,919
Was the president. He spoke on the subject

563
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,159
It was when one of his devotees came and

564
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,159
He had asked that Agnihotra Brahmin

565
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,440
Were. Agnihotra havan is performed to the Sun

566
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,840
For. So we asked him to perform a wet havan

567
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,400
Or perform dry havan. this story is complete

568
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,640
Shankaracharya Mahabhag has also told this. Meaning

569
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,120
Wet havan means that first the sacrifice

570
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,600
And with that meat again for the sun

571
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,760
We perform havan for the Sun. Ok? And

572
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,520
Dry havan means the havan which is performed with the havan material

573
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,080
It happens. Ok? So he said that

574
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,200
You should perform wet havan. means first sunrayan

575
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,600
Sacrifice it and then offer it to him as havan

576
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,799
Should be done. What is sacrificed?

577
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,720
Of the goat. Isn't it? Those of us who follow the path of Tantra

578
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,440
If there are people then the Panchamakar prevails amongst us.

579
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,080
Without meat, our worship is not complete

580
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,000
Is. Is it okay? So we debate in Tantra

581
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,640
I won't do it at all. if anybody is even talking

582
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,799
that you should not sacrifice then it does

583
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
Doesn't matter. It does not matter to us whether

584
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,840
Who is saying what? That practice of ours

585
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Is. It means that after someone

586
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,720
Someone else is expressing his opinion. so someone's

587
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,000
The intent doesn't matter. what is religion

588
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,080
are you speaking? That's all I have to see.

589
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,640
Effectively all sadhna including basic

590
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,440
If we sit in one place and do meditation

591
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:34,320
Chant the mantra HAM ENIDE THE MIND. We

592
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,039
There is an energy build up. Are we okay?

593
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,039
Over the years I'm from. So, what is your diet?

594
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,520
Because of that energy build up gets affected

595
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,880
Can it? as it is said that chakra can gate

596
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,279
Blocked because of non veg etc. So, I

597
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,720
I have thought a lot about this subject.

598
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,360
and please correct me if you say you are you

599
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,600
You I'm wrong. butt i think different mantra

600
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,919
has different rules. but is that right

601
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,799
or wrong? See, there are no different rules for different mantras

602
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,919
There are. Different gods have different rules.

603
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,960
So, when you are doing sadhana for someone, right?

604
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,320
So gradually your nature and behavior

605
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,559
Nor does he become like your East. That

606
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,159
If you are a devotee of Narayan. Now Narayan who

607
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:18,000
You will do whatever you enjoy, right? we are this

608
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,799
It works in this manner. Meaning, you should understand one thing.

609
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,799
the body of a human being or

610
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,039
You have a brain, you can see it in any dimension

611
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,360
Can not push. you can suppress

612
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,760
Are. And the thing which you will suppress

613
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,640
He is in some form or the other and he is

614
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,520
Will get back to you. Ok? So when you

615
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,240
If you are following religion then no religion

616
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,919
should allow it to flow as you

617
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,240
As you begin to practice,

618
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,440
When you follow the gods in the same way

619
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,399
His grace will keep coming to you and things will be in your favor

620
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,520
will change automatically in life and that is

621
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,640
You might think that I am the one doing this.

622
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,480
Then you may have what God wants

623
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,880
that you become a vegetarian but that god

624
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,840
will take you to a place where you will feel

625
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,679
I don't need it. the day you think

626
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,440
because if I don't do that then I will be very

627
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,240
I will develop in sadhana. it does not

628
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,159
Is. This does not happen. One might understand that

629
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
I have completely understood the game of Mahamaya.

630
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,960
So the gods could not understand what we understood

631
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,799
Will find it. you're gonna get all this mixed up

632
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,159
By not eating food. Isn't it? And I last

633
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,120
Bar also said that food is a matter of option

634
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,559
For those who have money. We give you the money

635
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,559
If not, then you do not have a god. As such

636
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,480
It doesn't happen. You can eat anything if you are a god

637
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:37,600
If you are engrossed in me then the god is for you

638
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,640
Will meet. Sadhna with Do You Feel That Diet

639
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,919
It gets affected. See, this doesn't happen to me

640
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,480
It happened till today. Ok? There is such a thing as any

641
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,480
not the one to whom you give too much priority

642
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,600
I will give. Ok? It will affect your sadhana.

643
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,880
What Why Should We Just Talk About Food?

644
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,120
Ok? If you do deep meditation and

645
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,919
If your phone is important to you, then it

646
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,399
Even the phone will distract you from your sadhana. A

647
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,640
Knock on the Door Can Like Green Your Meditation

648
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,279
And If You Think Your Meditation Is Very

649
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,520
Importent. Like you did Kriya Yoga

650
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,679
Is. So this is taught in Kriya Yoga

651
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,760
that even if a mosquito bites you it doesn't

652
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:19,760
Affect you. And they never talk about food. Give

653
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Talk about Sadhana. Isn't it? so the more you

654
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,919
Create a distraction. You for yourself

655
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,000
you set it that if I do this then it will happen

656
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,080
Will not done. If I do this it won't happen

657
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,799
will be. If I do this then this will not happen. Now

658
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,679
People say that it is tamasic food,

659
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,399
There is food. Ok? then you will eat satvik food

660
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:40,000
Then your mind will remain pure. so what does that mean

661
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:43,159
That means as much crime is happening right now

662
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,960
He is 100% non vegetarian

663
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:49,200
What? Isn't it? That is why it means tamasic food

664
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,760
by doing more good work

665
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,000
Are they all vegetarian? As such

666
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,799
What is it? Is there any such buffering system in the world?

667
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,600
Isn't it? So what are you eating?

668
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,880
It might change your mind about it

669
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,279
Meaning your idea is weak. Ok? They

670
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,720
Getting affected by anything. Meaning

671
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,440
You are saying that meditation and chanting of mantras

672
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,840
so much

673
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,440
We are such powerful weapons that actually no one

674
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,080
It is not affected by any thing. No effect

675
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,440
It happens. But if your mind is inside your heart

676
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,320
I have such doubts, self-doubts, then maybe

677
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,240
It might be affected. See in Sanatana Dharma

678
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,960
By eating these five things you can follow Sanatana Dharma

679
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,600
go out of

680
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,600
Are. So let me tell you one more thing now.

681
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:38,320
99.999% people are outside Sanatan Dharma.

682
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,320
because what are the things that mean who

683
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,679
These are the things that you eat

684
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:49,840
They are excluded from Sanatan Dharma. So garlic

685
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:51,600
Onion fine mushrooms. Ok? Pork and a

686
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,840
I can't remember the item right now. But

687
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Garlic, onions, mushrooms. Mushrooms mean

688
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,559
Vegetarians can also eat it. Isn't it? and this

689
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,399
There is pork and cow. So all of these things

690
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,640
By eating this you are out of Sanatan Dharma

691
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,880
Let's go. When we talk about Sanatana Dharma

692
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,799
Isn't it Sanatan Dharma is not confined to

693
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,440
Humans. Sanatana Dharma which is of the Gods

694
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,360
It is for animals and also for humans.

695
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,399
All knowledge was given to humans in some part

696
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,039
That which he can understand. Let us take the Mahabharata

697
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,480
The epic is our history book. When

698
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,240
Vyasa wrote the Mahabharata, so

699
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,240
It was finished in 24,000 verses. He

700
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,080
The one who was there for Rs 24,000 was the main principal.

701
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,720
After reading it, anyone can understand Mahabharata.

702
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,519
can't do it. then it was added to

703
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,559
History. So it became a history book and then

704
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,760
The Mahabharata which we read consisted of 1 lakh verses

705
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,399
Are. But this Rs 1 lakh that was given to us

706
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,600
Yes, this is a lesson from the Mahabharata. which is complete

707
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,600
Mahabharata is available for the gods.

708
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,679
It is not meant for humans at all. that's why

709
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,919
There are a lot of things that we

710
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,880
People have been told as a rule.

711
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,000
Because it is beyond our understanding to understand it

712
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,159
Is. An obvious question is that then that rule

713
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,240
where is the book? Why didn't you give it to me in my childhood?

714
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,840
Is this rule book gone? because the man that

715
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,679
can not understand. But what about humans

716
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,200
For which she can never be available? yes

717
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,000
It can. In our Vedas, there is mention of Yajnas

718
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,600
The number and method of Yagya has been explained. If

719
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,799
In a number you can read that Veda and

720
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,279
If he performs the yajna then you will be free from the human

721
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,000
they become gods. So, humans have to

722
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,880
The path to becoming a god in life was given

723
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,919
Is. So if you follow him and become a god

724
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,799
If you go, it is available for you. I am

725
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,880
Thinking about how Sanatan Dharma has progressed for centuries

726
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,600
increased? because we have been here for centuries

727
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,240
No. We have been around for many clever ages.

728
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,679
We have been here for many eons. We will never end

729
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,760
It did not happen. We are infinite, aren't we? of Sanatana

730
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,200
What does it mean? Which has been going on since the beginning.

731
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,440
We understand this in a very normal way

732
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,399
Are. Now there was Gandhi. Ok? Mahatma Gandhi

733
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,960
Were. how do you know about them

734
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:11,919
Are? By reading. You haven't seen it. Is

735
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,960
No? even when the end of mankind comes

736
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,639
The gods live. Ok? Like we told you

737
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,520
told that when Shri

738
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,520
Ram was crying

739
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:28,399
When he is wandering in the separation from his wife

740
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,800
At that time, Mahadev was in the jungle, only Ram Katha

741
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:35,040
I was listening. Ok?

742
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,320
And even earlier people knew the Rama Katha which

743
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,960
still going. Ok? So that time loop

744
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,079
the concept is not that time is stagnant and

745
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,440
We are changing stations. it

746
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,919
This is told in every story of Sanatan Dharma.

747
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,679
Ok? So our guardians are above us

748
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,960
The ones sitting here are gods. time is

749
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,079
Stagnant and we are changing stations. Wow

750
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,920
Meaning what was happening 2000 years ago is happening now

751
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,960
It is also happening somewhere. Cycle of Birth

752
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:07,119
And the same character. she body yes. may be some

753
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Another soul but the story remains same. you this

754
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,040
Do you believe that you are in the same family?

755
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,560
Rebirth happens. It is possible this would have been

756
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,560
Is.

757
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,560
People who helped us create our first podcast

758
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,280
I haven't seen them, even a little

759
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,839
It is necessary to provide contact. you know the same horror

760
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,359
The theme was podcasts. Yes, I remember. And

761
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,640
From somewhere it became Bhoot versus Bhairav.

762
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,320
Correct. Then talk of Tantra started coming up. And

763
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,560
After that chapter, the path of Tantra is known as the path of the gods.

764
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,160
I have to go to Sanatan Dharma. I have to go. I

765
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,040
I will tell you what I think about this chapter

766
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,720
Why am I talking now? we are my life

767
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,680
whatever happened in the last three months

768
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,480
Nor do I think that anything is as big as this

769
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,839
The two also had paranormal conversations

770
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,440
He has had some effect over the years. And

771
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,839
Because of that maybe from now on we will have

772
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,920
Reduce Paranormal Conversations on the

773
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,160
Show. And Talk More About Tantra Tantra or

774
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,560
Actually I wanted to talk to you because your

775
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,480
also switch on at some level same thing happened

776
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,640
But the question to you is that now at some point

777
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,599
In your spiritual journey I am sure that

778
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,359
Have you known Maa Kali, we are at least

779
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,320
I will have to go, I don't know if I have worshipped

780
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,119
Have you done it? Do you worship this Maa Kali?

781
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,599
Compare the worship with that chapter

782
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:28,240
when you deal with the oakley trail

783
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,760
were staying. There is some linkage between oral trials and

784
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,280
In the middle of Mahakali? C of Paranormal Research

785
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:39,839
if we talk then it is a very

786
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,000
dangerous state and let me tell you something that

787
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,440
if that is called sado science then there

788
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,599
There are reasons for it. Ok? because literally when

789
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,839
If we do paranormal research then we

790
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,480
R beating the bush. something we didn't know

791
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,200
What is in front is not there. Ok?

792
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,720
But paranormal research pushed me

793
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,280
to come inu sadhna

794
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:04,960
route. So once we investigate somewhere

795
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,079
Were doing it and that investigation is over

796
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:12,720
And the second day I came to know that I had a cut

797
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,520
Mark on my thigh. and that was the cut mark

798
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,480
That was painless. He didn't use pen.

799
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,599
From there our team decided that no, we

800
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,079
People we should go inu tantra way. Correct

801
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,880
Is? And then why does it happen little by little?

802
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,160
Because you're not in paranormal research

803
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,560
Taught how to deal with entities. Ok? So

804
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,400
One is to go on the path of sadhana even earlier

805
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,560
There was curiosity. what is the second if

806
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,880
you will have to go on the path of sadhana, then that

807
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,440
get you into it any way you can

808
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,839
that you have to come. Who brings it?

809
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,560
the deity you have been a devotee of, the one you

810
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,000
have been worshipers. Ok. so some incident happened

811
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,640
in your life because of which you

812
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,720
understood or not let's figure out what

813
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,200
we are dealing with what is the religious way out

814
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,520
This is what you mean in paranormal

815
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,640
have equipments you can like that feel something

816
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,480
So it is happening but in this tantra way you can see

817
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,960
what is happening this has happened with me

818
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,760
I know ok when mommy casts an evil eye or someone else

819
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,960
also take your eyes off me, what is actually happening

820
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,520
happens if a very negative person

821
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,079
Whose thoughts are very negative.

822
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,320
He always thinks negatively

823
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,560
It is about the people. such negative people

824
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,119
why thoughts manifest very quickly

825
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,680
Is. Very quickly. Like when on the path of sadhana

826
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,240
If you move forward then I will tell you

827
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,680
It will be told by your teachers that you should speak less.

828
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,440
Ok? What else? Think less. think less in

829
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,359
What? Think less negatively about yourself. You

830
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,280
If sadhana is on the path and you know about yourself

831
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,839
He will immediately think of negative things

832
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,839
Manifest does. You are something in your life

833
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,320
It is going to be positive. You think about that

834
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,440
I am negative, it is like a straight line

835
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,680
The work that is to be done will be done in 10 parts. Correct

836
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,000
Isn't it? in the same way that negative people

837
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,320
There are those who were earlier called witches.

838
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,280
meaning not a witch like not a Wiccan but a witch who

839
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,079
They used to say it. So basically if he looks at you

840
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,960
And don't think anything negative about you

841
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,200
So your energy meaning is called metaphysics

842
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,520
You assume that this is a theory of metaphysics

843
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,280
that the saw that is around you is yours

844
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,920
There is a field in which their energy shapes and mixes

845
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,599
it happens and once that energy is in your

846
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,640
If he comes inside then he will tell you according to his wish

847
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:27,839
Then it means your thinking, your physical structure

848
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,760
If it changes it then what do we do

849
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,920
When the bushes fall, what things do they use to shed them?

850
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,040
Are? They fall with lemon. It is acidic.

851
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,960
So whatever that unwanted energy is, it will go away from that

852
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,200
It goes out.

853
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,760
Ok. Can one ward off evil eye by worshipping goddess?

854
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,480
Can it be taken off? by herself who is the goddess

855
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,960
The seekers are not affected by evil eye. why is this

856
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
There is an armor form. Yes. any goddess

857
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,359
By the practice of. By worshipping any goddess.

858
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,640
Sadhana of Bhairava. Absolutely. of any deity

859
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,119
You should do sadhana. If you worship God

860
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,920
If you are doing it well then that God is yours

861
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:07,839
live with. protects the seeker from external attacks

862
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,000
One should not avoid one's own attacks too much.

863
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,000
Ok? what happens to a seeker

864
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,320
When everything in life seems to be going so well

865
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,800
isn't it then he starts thinking that this is this

866
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,119
things are going well and these things are happening

867
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,920
Otherwise, this problem may occur in our life

868
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,839
It can. It would be better if it doesn't happen.

869
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,839
But as soon as the seeker thought about himself

870
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,599
did he manifest those things

871
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,839
in your life even in the slightest form

872
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,880
She returns. So this means a lot to a seeker

873
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,800
It definitely happens with every seeker. what you

874
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,480
Negative Thoughts: Have you ever thought that

875
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,440
Manifest will do it. Positive also manifests

876
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,720
Will do it. Maybe this is also a human truth. But

877
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,480
Manifestation of your thoughts by doing sadhna

878
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,440
Ability is high. It becomes too much.

879
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,839
That is why just like we perform havan here, when

880
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,119
Do not open your mouth when havan is performed in Aghor

881
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,040
It happens. they don't talk even if you need something

882
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,599
No, you tell me in gestures to bring that

883
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,160
Bring it. you can't say a word every word that

884
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,319
This is set during Aghor Sadhna Havan

885
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,000
It will be manifested. about someone

886
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,240
Don't think bad. about someone

887
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,920
Don't say anything bad. And you were right. These

888
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,400
It happens for common people as well. a lot of people come

889
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,880
we have that our work is absolutely

890
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,800
It gets spoilt while being created. These were the people

891
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,720
Are you the one who thinks negatively about yourself?

892
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,040
Are. If any work is going to be done then its

893
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,760
you will think about it 10 times if this happens

894
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,680
So this work will not be done. That means absolutely 100%

895
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,680
yes, this work has to be done. But Than They Will Think

896
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,760
That if this happens then it will not happen. It will happen.

897
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,079
Everything they think about themselves. now that

898
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,240
It gradually manifests. things stop

899
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,599
It starts in life. One more life

900
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,960
I would like to say career oriented thing here. I

901
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,560
Think 99% of people are watching this podcast.

902
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,599
They also have materialistic goals

903
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:51,599
Are. Often I have seen that those who are

904
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,440
Those who worship Shakti,

905
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,680
Those sons have some materialistic

906
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,000
There are definitely quotas. doesn't mean that the

907
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,960
Devotion is not there. Worship with devotion

908
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,359
We do. What can we take from this career guidance

909
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,040
Can you? From Bhairav, from Shakti.

910
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:11,760
Look, this is a topic that people don't understand yet

911
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,160
A lot of people who are young right now are getting it

912
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,839
Everyone is becoming a sanyasi after completing their studies

913
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,240
Are. Ok? and according to them if he

914
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,800
worship goddess or gods in this way

915
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:27,599
If they worship then they have the path

916
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,440
It will be paved soon. People think like this don't they

917
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,119
that you wore a red dress, you wore a yellow dress

918
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,599
You have worn the clothes, you have worn the fallen clothes

919
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,520
If you take it then you become a great devotee. And if you

920
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,640
If you are wearing a shirt then you are a small devotee

921
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,160
Are. And you told me this last time too

922
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,000
asked if material desires are a

923
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,280
Is there hindrance in spiritual growth? Right?

924
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,880
Something like that. No, it is not. this is the

925
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,920
Plan of Mahamaya. Ok? we have such

926
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,839
There have been saints who have been saints since childhood.

927
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,319
In his childhood, he was given a

928
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,280
Whatever is there in the ashram is given to them

929
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:06,400
Mahamaya had decided that he would be a saint

930
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,640
or someone who is in a very unconscious state

931
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,880
He felt that he had to attain God. For him

932
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,359
Mahamaya has decided and sent you to go now

933
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,520
whatever this life of yours is

934
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,400
You have to attain the gods. You

935
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,079
Whatever it is, move away from this life. But the one who

936
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,800
In the household religion, a person is his first

937
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,079
The aim is that he should completely save the household

938
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:32,160
live by it and only then what is

939
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:35,200
What do you call that which is your own in religion?

940
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,000
time should be given and to the gods who

941
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,920
Keep the feeling you have and tell it to the gods

942
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You decide what is best for us

943
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,160
Do it.

944
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,280
ok to

945
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:50,960
summarize a i think you are saying that a

946
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,359
There is a path of human life. First you

947
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,240
about yourself about your family

948
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:59,040
I first think about my own comfort

949
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,440
Attention should be paid to all things. and if

950
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,640
Your heart desires to move forward in Sadhana

951
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,119
I should request the daughter to

952
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,800
Take me to that. the one who is your date

953
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,680
will pave your way. all the same

954
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,760
I will make arrangements. Let us assume 12 from today 10

955
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,760
years ago or when we only knew Durga

956
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,440
Used to recite Saptashati. We knew a little about

957
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,839
You will become a seeker. We have lived a life of our own

958
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,560
began. I studied mass communication

959
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,480
of. We worked in newspapers. We

960
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,640
Worked at UNICEF and did whatever.

961
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,640
Remained in politics for a few days. we never

962
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,280
Did you know what we said? absolutely

963
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,640
We will follow the path of religion. But the gods

964
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,280
has turned our lives in such a way that we

965
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,040
Came into the path of sadhana. and just as much as

966
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,640
The more we pay attention to the gods, the more we

967
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,800
Also pay attention to your household. Any 

968
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,400
But even if we are paying less attention to it

969
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,599
Meaning we are not right with our religion

970
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,359
because the first religion which we get

971
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,079
We have to follow the Dharma of the household

972
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,079
Is. Or else we should become sannyasis. Everything

973
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,200
Leave it, don't do that, become a fugitive

974
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,000
Needed Is it okay? Wood you say that the monk

975
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,640
The core logic behind its creation is that

976
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,800
We have to progress in our sadhana quickly. Meaning

977
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,960
The core logic of speed remains.

978
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,280
See now when you talk to the sannyasis

979
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,520
Nor would those people make fun of this thing

980
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,760
Are. Now, there is too much renunciation happening.

981
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,760
If you ask the sanyasis why so many

982
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,440
The number of sannyasis who are girl sannyasis is increasing

983
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,040
He will tell you there are four types of sannyasis

984
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,520
Are. Ok?

985
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,880
First

986
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:28,960
Sanyasis who do not wish to work, they

987
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,920
become a sanyasi. do some work

988
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,000
They keep getting food. Other sannyasis

989
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,760
He who is suffering from the household, he is suffering from his wife

990
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,480
Are you upset or are you troubled by your family members?

991
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,400
He retires. The third monk who

992
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,480
He has fled after committing a crime and has become a sadhu

993
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,480
They go so that the police cannot catch them.

994
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:51,760
And there is a very small section of Sanyas Ashram

995
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:54,319
which is really just like nurturing the gods

996
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,359
He retires for the sake of it. This is a very small

997
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,680
There is a section that will be available

998
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:01,680
No. The rest is meant for us

999
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,160
Gurudev was a saint. He said what

1000
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,160
If it didn't happen to your family, it will happen to you.

1001
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,640
He said a big thing while laughing

1002
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,800
But you can understand what a big deal he is

1003
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,160
She said and even the sanyasis say this

1004
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,800
What? Not every sannyasi is such that you

1005
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,440
I should bow down and pay obeisance to him. Very little

1006
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,839
The Sanyasis are those who are from childhood. For them

1007
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,920
Looking at you, this feeling will come that is there. For them

1008
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,000
After seeing him you will understand that he is a sannyasi.

1009
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,160
Now we will talk about that timeline

1010
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,480
In. We are going to tell you about the timeline of the 10 Mahavidyas.

1011
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,720
Actually let's boil it down completely. Gin

1012
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,520
People have also heard about 10 Mahavid

1013
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,720
No, let's start from there. Good

1014
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,040
Chapter Zero I think it's a no. Very nice.

1015
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,960
Ok. See what is there about 10 Mahavidyas

1016
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,839
There is a lot of confusion in me. Ok. 10

1017
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,280
This is true about Mahavidya. is mahavid

1018
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:54,720
Different chapters of knowledge or evolution

1019
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,960
of knowledge like the 10th avatar of the human

1020
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,240
it's about evolution in the same way

1021
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,720
Knowledge or enlightenment of your brain

1022
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,720
It is about him. but 10 great scholars

1023
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,920
one who understands where the origin of

1024
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,760
The thing is. He who knows that story

1025
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,240
Knows the importance of 10 Mahavidyas

1026
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:16,119
In life. Ok? Now we have named Durga

1027
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:19,119
I took Bhagwati’s. End of Durga Saptashati

1028
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:22,960
When I complete 13 chapters then

1029
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,839
Bhagwati says in the end that now my

1030
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,319
To kill the inaccessible demon

1031
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,960
And then I'll be Durga Durga

1032
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,040
I will tell you, understand that we have written 13 chapters

1033
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,000
I read Durga Saptashati and at last Bhagwati

1034
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,119
said now my name will be Durga when I

1035
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,079
It is about the timeline, I didn't

1036
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,839
He said, time is stagnant so first of all Bhagwati

1037
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,319
In that book the name was written as Durga

1038
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,000
It has happened. In the 13th chapter of that book, Bhagwati

1039
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,800
It says that when the Durgam demon is killed

1040
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,880
If I do it then I will be called Durga. This is the Durga

1041
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,560
It was from there that the 10 Mahavidyas emerged

1042
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:00,240
There came into being. of the inaccessible monster

1043
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:02,319
Arrival took place. It was very austere and inaccessible

1044
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,119
The demon took a boon from Lord Brahma that

1045
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:07,680
All the knowledge about the earth should come to me.

1046
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,920
Ok? So the inaccessible monster has the rest

1047
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,960
Apart from having knowledge, the four Vedas are also

1048
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,760
became his slaves. Ok? So the earth which

1049
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,960
Isn't it so? She has become disinterested in knowledge. Earth

1050
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,280
But there is no knowledge left and there is chaos

1051
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,839
Done. Meaning in Devlok everyone is like an animal

1052
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,079
Started doing it. Started living like animals. Complete

1053
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,400
Meaning that the entire creation is going to be destroyed

1054
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,640
Put. What will happen without knowledge? So the god

1055
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,960
who went to Brahma ji and said that you

1056
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,559
Has he given this boon? then goddess

1057
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,440
These people appealed to the same

1058
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:42,640
From the sources. Ok? and the Bhagawati

1059
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,559
Took the form of Durga. Ok? and Durga's

1060
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,839
After taking the form of Durgam, he killed the demon

1061
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:51,119
for 10 more goddesses apart from Durga

1062
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,880
An outbreak occurred. who together made the inaccessible

1063
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,520
Killed the demon. his his whole

1064
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,960
Destroyed the empire and all four Vedas

1065
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:02,319
I brought it back from them. So when he came back with the Vedas

1066
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,800
the knowledge which had vanished from the world

1067
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:07,839
Vidya had gone away, she has come back. that's why

1068
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,280
These are called Mahavidya. Vedas to the world

1069
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:14,880
Durga's 10 incarnations

1070
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,319
Appearance took place and Vedas were those 10 incarnations

1071
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,359
She brought it back and Gyan came back. that's why

1072
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:25,359
Mahavidya is okay, right? So black is the first one in that

1073
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:28,960
Tara then Tripura Sundari then Bhuvaneshwari

1074
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,920
Chinmastika Matangi. She is Matangi. Yes.

1075
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,720
After that Baglamukhi

1076
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,040
Is. Matangi is the ninth Mahavidya. so this

1077
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,920
There were different Mahavidyas. So Kali's work

1078
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:44,640
is to give birth as I told you. Tara's

1079
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:47,160
The job is to impart knowledge. in a person's life

1080
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,359
of their hearts and minds

1081
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:55,280
What is the role of these 10 Mahavidyas inside?

1082
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,440
In a human journey. 10 Mahavidya Sadhak's

1083
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,559
When you do sadhna in life and Bhagwati

1084
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:05,280
If you do sadhna of this then you will get knowledge of all the ten Mahavidyas

1085
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:08,480
One has to live. Ok? So black is black

1086
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:12,240
What is? Kali with Mahadev of Mahakal

1087
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,119
She sits together. He is fierce. Ok? and two more

1088
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,839
It is extreme. one black and one

1089
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:21,040
Of Tripura Sundari. Both are black. As

1090
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:24,079
We know Kala Bhairava and Gora Bhairava. We

1091
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,760
Similarly, one of them is black and the other is white

1092
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,240
Is. Is it okay? So Kali when you meditate

1093
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,960
When Kali comes into the area and casts her eyes on you

1094
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,880
If you read it, you are born in the system.

1095
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,599
Ok? Then you come to the second stage.

1096
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,240
Yes, Tara is coming. Tara's job is for you

1097
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,880
Cutting off past karmas. Ok? Who

1098
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,920
You have knots to cut and you will gain knowledge

1099
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,520
Give. Is it okay? then come in third

1100
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:52,000
Ah Tripura Sundari. which means all three

1101
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,040
It is considered the most beautiful among the people. He

1102
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,839
You have the most beautiful looks and the most beautiful mind

1103
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,240
They give. Ok? Then comes Bhuvaneshwari.

1104
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,480
She expands that opulence.

1105
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,960
Chinmastika comes again and what you have till today

1106
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,880
Learning destroys it. Isn't it a beheading?

1107
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,440
Whoremastika. The fierce Chandika has raised her neck

1108
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,160
Cut it off. So what do they say there?

1109
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,599
It destroys your ego. Then

1110
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:18,240
Bhairavi comes who is your enemy

1111
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,160
It destroys him. Yours in the first

1112
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,359
I have destroyed your ego

1113
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,280
Mastika cut off the head and then Bhairavi came

1114
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,040
And they destroyed everything else. Correct

1115
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,280
Is? then in the same order as

1116
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:34,079
Yes, Dhumavati is coming. that too of destruction

1117
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,680
Devi and Baglamukhi come. Dhumavati to you

1118
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:40,160
It revives and the one who is Baglamukhi

1119
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:43,119
determines that whatever elements are around you

1120
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,359
These are the things that prevent you from becoming a successful seeker now

1121
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,760
May they be destroyed. That is the final stage. Then

1122
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,920
Matangi comes. Matangi teaches you again

1123
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,480
She gives it. the knowledge that was lost when

1124
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,760
Chhin Mastika had broken you. Ok? And

1125
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,640
In the end comes Mahalakshmi Kamala who will bless you

1126
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,440
takes you back to the same glory you were in

1127
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,599
Were in the beginning. Ok? it is also called Garuda yoga

1128
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,480
They say. What is of the eagle which is of the phoenix

1129
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,800
it is a concept or not it is the same concept

1130
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,960
that the eagle dies and rises again

1131
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,680
He is alive. so in human life

1132
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,200
This Garuda Yoga brings you great height

1133
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,359
will stay and then fall again

1134
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,280
Will get up. or who will rise a second time then fall

1135
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,800
Does not happen. what am I not able to do in office

1136
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,240
should keep?

1137
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,440
do you think its negative energy because i

1138
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,520
have had a Kali worshipper come and

1139
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,839
He said hey the skull is of Kali

1140
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:36,000
We are my favourites but I don't know especially

1141
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:38,800
after this face I don't keep such things

1142
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,599
How do you feel? Are they affecting you?

1143
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,680
Am I not affected by these decorations?

1144
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,839
I feel like I'm not affected

1145
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,400
yes that's it it doesn't affect so it's about

1146
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:52,960
what you put into art basically it is a

1147
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,800
Art hum that's how I look at it. yes it is

1148
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,119
everything will start affecting in your

1149
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,720
Life. Then it will become difficult to live. We every

1150
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,800
You will keep thinking about the thing. From this

1151
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,760
This is happening to me, that is happening to me.

1152
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:09,839
Each person has his own interpretation

1153
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:13,319
Is. The head of Bhagwati Kali is the favourite

1154
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:16,440
Is. There is nothing like that. Yes. Ok.

1155
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:20,520
When Kali does Tantra Sadhna

1156
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:25,359
No, then we would have given Kali a seat on our heads

1157
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:30,079
Are. It has a prescribed format that

1158
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:32,559
In this way you bring that head.

1159
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:37,760
Whatever ghost is there then it would be invoked

1160
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:41,280
and then we place Bhagvati on top of it

1161
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,200
Are. That's all the head is used for. Ok

1162
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,160
shaved nothing that needs to be shown

1163
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,559
or are you on the wrong path of wandering

1164
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,880
There are three seekers. it had a skull

1165
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:53,359
Is. So the one who is Kapalika is made from skulls

1166
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,760
He does sadhana. This is called skull. So

1167
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,760
Cranial activities take place. one is the skull

1168
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,559
Not the rituals which are performed on dead bodies.

1169
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,720
There are skull operations in which

1170
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,839
All powers are surrendered. Means it

1171
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,160
Just like we use memory cards now

1172
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,000
Yes, it is kept in that manner. all

1173
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,800
sadhanas are offered there and

1174
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,800
goddess above him

1175
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:18,000
The ka is established. Therefore, the skull

1176
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,319
It is important. Ok.

1177
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,200
But this is obviously not an actual skull. These

1178
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:27,119
Maybe it's made of POP, I don't know from what?

1179
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:30,079
Is. But because it is made in this shape

1180
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,319
Because of this the energy gets affected. any of the

1181
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,200
Cheese does not have an energy effect on you

1182
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:38,559
Apart from the mind of. no the same veg non veg one

1183
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:41,359
The logic is the same that eating it does not have any effect

1184
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,720
could you mean any material like that

1185
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:47,839
There can be no interest or no interest. we our

1186
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:50,960
Guruji is the one who taught us so much when we were beginners

1187
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:53,040
When we were in the period of sadhana then we

1188
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,079
By looking at this one could understand the Tantra of the path

1189
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,240
There is a person. because it's all in our hands

1190
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,640
Something was always tied. Something used to be tied here.

1191
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,040
Used to wear garlands.

1192
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,200
So they asked me why are you doing this so much

1193
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,440
do you wear it? So we told them that this is us

1194
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,839
Wear it for your protection. This is ours

1195
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,880
It is an amulet. You should assume that. So he

1196
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:16,160
He said that this is not the talisman of a seeker. of the seeker

1197
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,760
This is the amulet. where a seeker sits

1198
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:21,760
There is no negative energy there

1199
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,599
Needed So if you are wearing it yourself then

1200
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,480
What will you protect the rest of us from? What

1201
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,480
Will you meet the powers that be? so today is that day

1202
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,800
It is the day of. We don't wear anything that

1203
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,040
that from the security point of view

1204
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,359
Be important. The same way we treat everyone

1205
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,839
Should become a talisman. Ok? external

1206
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:40,160
Energy: Nothing can disturb you.

1207
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:42,079
You should be that strong. The seeker especially

1208
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,720
He has so much faith in his Guru and the East

1209
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,200
It should be that when they are there then no one can control us

1210
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,040
Energy that is not work

1211
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,040
will do it. Stay safe. no different for him

1212
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,280
There is no need to recite the mantras.

1213
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,599
What does Maa Kali want from her devotees?

1214
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,160
Mother Kali wants this from her devotees

1215
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,520
May you attain nirvana sin. you everything

1216
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:04,359
Learn to do so. Everyone should understand this. Ok? that's why

1217
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:07,760
Maya's job is to take you to Mahadev

1218
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:10,400
Go. Maya was born in this game

1219
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,359
in order to create so that the living beings who are souls

1220
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,480
Nor could he understand what their purpose was.

1221
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:18,400
So as long as they are given different tasks, today's language

1222
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,400
I speak. that task will not be done

1223
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,280
Until then he will not understand what is not

1224
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,920
Is. What is the balance of the universe? So the goddess

1225
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,319
Kali's only purpose is to make you

1226
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,200
will take you to the path from where you can reach Mahadev

1227
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:35,680
It should reach till. I love them very much

1228
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:38,000
has increased a lot lately we mean

1229
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,839
If I get a little emotional right now I

1230
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I will start crying that much I am feeling affection

1231
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:46,160
we are with them so I will not talk to them

1232
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,119
more about that attachment when we

1233
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,000
When sadhana started we became Tara

1234
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,960
He was practicing Maha Vidya but Tara

1235
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,880
we were not able to prove it okay so

1236
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:01,200
We just talked about Guruji, right?

1237
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:05,040
Then he gave us a mantra of Kali and that

1238
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,680
Only by mantras and not by miracles in my life

1239
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:11,359
Interview

1240
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:14,280
It happened and when we caught Kali then Tara

1241
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:17,599
we were also able to catch us and

1242
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,680
Then our journey continues till Bhairav ​​ji

1243
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:22,480
remained. Five of its 10 Mahavidyas

1244
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:26,079
of this from Tantra and the rest from Sri Vidya

1245
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,400
Completed the sadhana. Explain that when the mother

1246
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:34,400
What happens when Kali comes into your life? So

1247
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:38,079
Bhagwati Kali, that is birth, that is time and

1248
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:41,440
Black darkness, great void, everything is right from there

1249
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,160
If we start, then we start with Bhagwati Kali only

1250
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,000
Tantra also started when for the first time something

1251
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,760
did not understand that we were doing something

1252
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,440
If you come into Tantra Sadhna in the beginning then

1253
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,319
You won't understand anything for three-four years

1254
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,160
So it is blank, you won't feel anything, why?

1255
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:57,920
we are not able to understand any difference

1256
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,520
you will become a bit aggressive which means

1257
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,359
They say there is some value addition in life

1258
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,400
do not seem. v is why it's not too

1259
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:08,079
Enjoy the process. Yes yes, just enjoy it.

1260
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:11,359
So when I was doing sadhna of Kali Bhagwati then

1261
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:13,440
For the first time I felt that our

1262
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:18,480
The mantra is awakening or our goddess

1263
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:21,520
Is with me. We had gone to a place to perform havan. So

1264
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,319
That too was a Nath family. But to us he

1265
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,880
There was a little enthai. So there was a pyre. over there

1266
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:29,040
The havan was being performed. So those people have a lot of

1267
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,799
The material was collected and kept. Us

1268
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,960
We were invited to perform havan but we

1269
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:36,440
The material was not provided. Gave very little. so he

1270
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:39,839
If you were doing your havan then you were doing havan

1271
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:42,000
So they are throwing one material after another into the pyre

1272
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:44,079
Were. But the pyre was not burning. that means

1273
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,400
That doesn't happen. very last stage water

1274
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:50,240
Had been. And a lot of the fuss that happens is smoking

1275
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,640
It happens that he threw it away. nothing he

1276
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,240
It wasn't burning at all.

1277
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,920
So we had our Kali mantra there

1278
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,760
of. When our Gurudev said something

1279
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,079
If you don't have it then you can pick up some soil and perform havan

1280
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,240
Do it because everything belongs to God. those

1281
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,079
It is made of. That is the five elements. Your

1282
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,559
Is it all tasty or tasteless for them

1283
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:11,200
That's it. So what did we do that Bhagwati's

1284
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:14,480
Took the mantra. He picked up the ashes from there and buried them on the pyre

1285
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:17,839
We sacrificed ourselves thrice and that pyre was burnt

1286
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,839
got up. So we thought that yes, that means Bhagvati is our

1287
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:22,079
and for the first time I realised that

1288
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:25,319
Tantra we are doing or learning

1289
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:28,079
There is something in it. So it took a lot of time.

1290
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:30,799
Goddess Bhagwati has blessed us very much. very often

1291
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:33,760
It seemed like I should give up now. Tools

1292
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:36,400
We used to do it a lot. in our house our

1293
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,559
The room is at the end and our

1294
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,200
Dad was also about to go to our room at that time.

1295
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,920
They were afraid. But then slowly Bhagwati told everything

1296
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:48,079
Some things were resolved. Then Tara Mahavidya

1297
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,720
I. Thara was interviewed in life.

1298
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:54,480
Then the eye of knowledge opened. Then Bhairava came. Then

1299
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:57,280
The worship of Chin Mastika Baglamukhi Bhairavi

1300
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:01,520
We did it. Then from the entire Shankaracharya Mahabhag

1301
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:04,640
We took initiation and then their Bhuvaneshwari

1302
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,599
and Tripura Maritime and five Colleges

1303
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,160
I practiced his sadhana. That sequence is ongoing right now

1304
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:14,240
Used to be. A friend of mine in my building

1305
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:16,640
Is. He found a devi mantra online. And

1306
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,280
Asked me to do this. I said yaar I

1307
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,040
Don't know honestly. and it's not my right

1308
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,079
to give you the meaning because I meant it

1309
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,960
I haven't even practised. we are these

1310
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:29,040
I said now it's not my right, is that

1311
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,680
The Correct Way of Looking at Things. Yes yes.

1312
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:35,119
first of all

1313
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:38,000
You should get a month from a Guru family. One

1314
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,799
The mantra should come to you from the guru tradition.

1315
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,200
And your Guru has to be given authority by his Guru

1316
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:47,119
You should be able to pass on this mantra

1317
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:50,040
Are. Only then are you eligible to cast the spell.

1318
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:53,680
Otherwise there are many mantras available. Correct

1319
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,599
Is? and if you read it you might

1320
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,920
You may suffer loss. anything can happen to you

1321
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,079
No. Ok? its not good with you

1322
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,760
Can. Yes. Why can't it happen?

1323
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,920
Because it is as good as a poem. Or

1324
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,240
The mantra of cheating that you don't have the right to

1325
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,200
It is like a poem. You just read it

1326
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:15,200
For him. I told you a story, right

1327
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,359
The Englishman who met a saint in Benares

1328
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,720
To take the Gayatri Mantra. The saint refused

1329
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:21,920
Given that you are English then I am not

1330
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,839
Give. The Englishman had money. he is someone

1331
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,640
And went to the Acharya. From that, Gayatri Mantra

1332
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:28,640
Took it. He came and told the saint that he had

1333
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,599
This is the Gayatri Mantra. So the saint said you

1334
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,680
Recite the Gayatri Mantra. so he heard it from Om

1335
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,160
Gave. So the saint recited this Gayatri Mantra

1336
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,240
Not there. The British thought that we had left. He

1337
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,240
He went back to his teacher and said that the saint

1338
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,480
I am saying that what you said is

1339
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,440
There is no Gayatri Mantra. Then Acharya jumped

1340
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,280
having done this he came to the saint and said, we have our

1341
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,599
He told the disciple that this is not the Gayatri Mantra

1342
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:52,119
Is. So he said no. then he said to the disciple

1343
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,960
tell me. Then the disciple recited the Gayatri

1344
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:56,799
mantra. So you pronounced it literally correct. So

1345
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,480
Acharya said this is Gayatri Mantra. Saint

1346
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:00,960
He said this is not Gayatri Mantra. Then

1347
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:05,040
The religious assembly of Banaras met to decide this

1348
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,040
For and when the religious assembly of Banaras sat

1349
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,880
Then the Englishman recited the Gayatri Mantra again.

1350
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,119
The Mantra Dharma Sabha said that he narrated it correctly

1351
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,400
The saint said that this is not Gayatri

1352
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,079
The religious assembly said the mantra that Saint Sahab

1353
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,839
We too know this Gayatri Mantra

1354
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,799
Are. So he said you guys have the right

1355
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:23,280
are received. So when you read this, it

1356
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:25,359
This is the Gayatri Mantra. the rights you receive

1357
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,880
he is not a person if he chants the gayatri mantra

1358
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:29,680
If he reads it then it is not considered as Gayatri

1359
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,079
Will go. in the same way if you do anything,

1360
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,240
looking up mantra yantra or tantra online

1361
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,720
without any Guru who has the right to

1362
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,280
If not, then it becomes invalid.

1363
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,119
It doesn't make any sense. Then the Psalms

1364
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,119
What happens? You can source it.

1365
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,440
All of them are praises, all of them are hymns, all of them

1366
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,599
can you read. Devotion increases. yes joe

1367
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,280
is a must. Yes. the gods were pleased

1368
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:55,520
It is from him. Like if a normal person is called a goddess

1369
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:59,520
If you want to worship then buy Durga Saptashati

1370
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,440
Take. There is a chapter on Durga in the name of Namaavali

1371
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,359
Durgati Shamani Durga Pad Nivarani Durgham

1372
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,359
Chedni Fort Shani Fort Nashani Fort Dhani

1373
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:07,599

Durdhani has 32 names so this is the name given to it

1381
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:27,359
You can chant it every day but you don't have the right

1382
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,039
Even then you can chant it when you wake up

1383
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:31,359
You can chant this also. Due to this, Bhagwati

1384
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,480
She feels very happy. We who worship the Goddess

They are like this. They

1390
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:51,680
It means magnification. That is a prayer. Ok?

1391
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,520
And what is the mantra? it's a vibration

1392
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,480
which the sages and saints had given to us

1393
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,520
