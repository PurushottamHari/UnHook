I 100% did not think that Huaja Af was going to admit to me as the defense minister of Pakistan that the state of Pakistan has used terrorism as part of their policy. I think that if the world doesn't sit up and take notice of everything that's happening in Pakistan, it's a matter of time before we see another global terror attack at the scale of everything that happened in 2001. Terror is the enemy of humanity, not just the enemy of India. Barack Obama and the United States in the dead of night. They sent Navy Seals to the country to take out Osama bin Laden and didn't inform Pakistan tells you everything about what conversations were being had behind closed doors. If they didn't understand it then, I don't think they can understand it now. In Karachi, I have seen with my own eyes the most extreme forms of indoctrination of young people and how they prosecute what they're doing. I noticed that even on Pierce's show, he positioned America like it was the big brother, but the truth is there was nothing that President Trump said that affected this situation. When President Trump said there is a ceasefire, both sides have spoken. India would have felt angry and I don't want to speak on behalf of India, but my understanding and reading is that they are a great power. They don't want other great powers tangled up and Pakistan feels well, we are a weaker nation. We're a smaller nation. Therefore, we want China tangled up here. We want the United States tangled up. Kala Hakeim is a lead world news presenter on Sky News. She's become extremely popular in India over the last 3 to four weeks because she's one of the rare global news reporters who spoken about the IndiaPakistan conflict. She interviewed the defense minister of Pakistan, Quaja ASF. That clip went viral in India. My intention with bringing her on TRS is to ask her the questions that India has with respect to global media. But this whole episode is an attempt to take India's voice out to the globe as well. Without further ado, this is a detailed conversation on geopolitics with a focus on everything that's happening between India and Pakistan as we speak. Hope you gain a lot of value from this episode. [Music] Yaldahhim, welcome to the Reanir Show. Uh, I have to begin by saying thank you on behalf of our whole country. Thank you, Reanir. Thank you. Um honestly I I've been getting so many um wonderful sort of remarks and comments and and um really a lot of warmth from India but I I I genuinely just felt I was doing my job. Uh I think the way Indians perceive it you were being very objective. You were just presenting facts and figures as uh every world journalist should. Thank you. Um and honestly I I I think you know one of the things about being a journalist and and you know I spent over a decade at the BBC I'm at Sky now um the values very much remain the same and and also you know I have almost two decades of of experience in the field certainly in the um region in India Pakistan Afghanistan um I mean I've worked across the globe in places like Ukraine and North Africa the Arab world and I'm currently um in in Doha in Qatar following President Trump's trip. Um so I think you know you draw on um a sort of experience and understanding of these regions as well. Okay. Um we have to kind of begin by speaking about the IndiaPakistan situation from your eyes as of now. You've covered it right from the start. Uh your interview with Quaja AF the Pakistan defense minister went viral all over India. Honestly, it's become a massive part of conversations here. So, I would love to hear about the whole uh experience from your perspective. Uh and I'd love for you to highlight the Quaja ASF interview as well. So Reanir um as things were um simmering I mean if I go back to uh Pelgam the the attack in Kashmir I really feel as though newsrooms around the world certainly in the western world don't quite understand why Kashmir is a flash point why it is one of the most militarized zones on the planet so when the attack happened it was sort of um a story that appeared and broke on my show so I do a 9:00 uh in the UK a um evening foreign affairs show. It broke and our India correspondent quickly put something together to highlight that it it was had happened and it sat somewhere within the bulletin and immediately when I saw it I was like wait a second this is a major terrorist attack and you know 26 people have died tourists innocent civilians so we should be exploring this a little bit more and again because our focus and attention always is on you know what President Trump is doing and what is going on politically in our part of the world. um it was kind of um dipping in and out of conversation in our newsrooms but wasn't dominating any kind of conversation and and the newsrooms like all newsrooms moved on quite quickly but because I understand the intricacies because I followed the issues around um terrorism in India terrorism in Pakistan um as I said for 15 plus years of my career I was really keen to to continue to highlight it. So 3 days after the uh Pelgam attack, one of my producers um said to me, "Oh, we might have the defense minister of Pakistan. Um would you be interested in speaking to him?" And I said, "Absolutely. Let's get him on. Let's talk to him." And you know, India was was really ratcheting up the rhetoric. India was angry. India had promised to retaliate. India immediately pointed the finger of blame on Pakistan. And a lot of people couldn't understand why. Why is the state of Pakistan being blamed for a terrorist attack that militants terrorists launched in Indian administered Kashmir? They couldn't join the dots. So when um initially the um defense minister canled the interview because they said they were holding a national security council meeting and the top cabinet meeting ministers in Pakistan were meeting to discuss how India was reacting to the terrorist attack. So they canled it. The next day they said actually we'll do it tonight. And again I sort of thought this is brave. This is interesting. Why is Pakistan wanting to come out and talk about this? Because I understood what was going on. And I guess for the longest time Pakistani officials feel that accusations if a journalist is somewhat aware about the the terrorism connection between the ISI and and um these terrorist groups they might raise it and then Pakistan denies denies denies and then everyone moves on. So I prepared myself. I was really thinking about the interview. Which angles can I come into? And I 100% did not think that Huaja Af was going to admit to me on air as the current serving defense minister of Pakistan that the state of Pakistan has used terrorism as part of their policy as part of their state craft. Of course there is murkiness everywhere. All states use proxies on some level, but officials always come out and they deny that they're doing it. They say that these are groups that have issues with um governments. They launch these attacks. It has nothing to do with us. So when I sat across or you know we we patched up with Huaja Af and I began asking the questions and I said to him India's pointing the finger of blame and he said I don't know why they're blaming us. This is India's problem. you know, we we condemn this terrorist attack, but it's got nothing to do with us. And I thought I'm going to obviously ask the question that you do admit though that you have had a history Pakistan has had a history of uh state sponsor sponsoring of of terrorism to this day. Anyone who is following Pakistan, anyone who is following the history of Pakistan understands this. And in the past, Pakistani officials have um when they have um stepped down from their posts, they have admitted this. Whether it is the former ISI chief, you know, General Durani, whether it's Perez Musharov, whether it's Benazir Bruto, when they step down, yeah, they talk about it. Yeah, we used it. It's part of our state craft. I did not think the serving defense minister of Pakistan would say, "Yes, this is what we do. This is what we have. This is why we use it." And it's not just us. We're doing the dirty work of you, the West. What did you make of it the moment he said that? Like what was your first thought? As a journalist who's been around for a while, you understand how the world of geopolitics works. So I'd love to know about your mind in that situation. I I I realized immediately that it was extraordinary. And I thought maybe he didn't quite process what I was saying. Maybe I misunderstood him. So I wanted clarity and I pushed him again initially. I mean you know a lot of people have sort of replayed the interview and captured my initial reaction in that moment because I I did jolt. I I sort of you know I I sort of couldn't believe what I was hearing uh that he was saying you know well we did the dirty work of the west and yes we have these proxies and they exist and this is how it is. So I did jolt and I said,"Well, is that is that your justification? You know, is this you're justifying now that Pakistan has this connection with terrorist groups because we're going back to the mujahedin, the CIA, and the dirty work of then. So it's now just part of what Pakistan does." And he said, "No, this is the reason why you're saying this to me." And he he he again for the interview went for about 18 minutes and he didn't back down at any point. He made it clear to me that he understood what I was saying. he was going to say what he was going to say and that is that Pakistan has had the longest history and what has been the underbelly and and the so-called deep state of Pakistan and how they operate. Yeah. Um considering that this conflict has gone on for the last couple of weeks, my question to you is uh more from a global perspective, do you think the world understands exactly what's happening in the subcontinent at this point? And do they also kind of remember that Osama bin Laden was found in Pakistan and is that a thought bubble for the rest of the world? So like I said first of all I think there's a lack of understanding and the lack of understanding comes from a lack of access and the lack of access comes because India their policy is why should we justify ourselves to the world? We are a great power. We are a a superpower in not just the region but globally. We have had this bipartisan relationship with the United States for 25 years. We are, you know, a power in the region that the United States wants to partner with to counter China, for example. But I think what was quite extraordinary when we saw President Trump put out that statement on Truth Social and said there is a ceasefire. Both sides have spoken and now I think that they should make a deal on Kashmir. That is something that India would have you know felt angry because they their feeling and I don't want to speak on behalf of India but my understanding and reading is that we are not on equal footings. We are a great power. Pakistan is a much weaker power. We don't want other great powers tangled up in our backyard. We want to deal with our issues ourselves. And Pakistan feels well we are a weaker nation. We're a smaller nation. Therefore, we want other great powers. We want China tangled up here. We want the United States tangled up here, you know. And so these this sort of complexity isn't fully grasped, I don't think, by the US president who came out and said that. I don't think um Western audiences fully understand. And for me, why I believe it matters is because when a state is a state sponsor of terrorism and was on a grrey list and Osama bin Laden was discovered there, if the West doesn't hold the state accountable and when Osama bin Laden in 2012 was was discovered just a stone throw away from a military uh headquarters and base, the CIA director at the time said either Pakistan was implicit or it was incompetent. And at the time Pakistan pleaded, the ISI pleaded incompetence. They would rather say we didn't know that he was right there than say yes sure, we were aware and we let him stay there and we harbored him and we backed him. And the fact that at that point in time, Barack Obama and the United States didn't hold Pakistan accountable. In the dead of night, they sent Navy Seals to the country to take out Osama bin Laden and didn't inform their ally Pakistan and and their partner Pakistan in the war on terror that we're doing this because they were so worried that the operation would fall apart, that somehow Osama bin Laden would be tipped off and that he wouldn't be there when the Navy Seals uh got there. tells you everything about the the what conversations were being had behind closed doors. If they didn't understand it then the role of the ISI and they still continue to give them billions of dollars, I don't think they can understand it now. Yeah. Uh some key points I wish to bring up again. I think that if the world doesn't sit up and take notice of everything that's happening in Pakistan, it's a matter of time before we see another global terror attack at the scale of everything that happened in 2001 and the early 2000s. Uh it has become a terror hub for the world. Uh it's just that in India we know about the Lashkar Tibad, the Jes Muhammad because the terrorist attacks are targeted towards us. But the nature of terrorism is such that eventually it's not going to be limited to one target country. It has the potential to spread all across the globe. And India's main narrative to the world is hey we are a GDP that's 11 times the size of Pakistan because we're focused on our own economy. We're focused on job creation. We're focused on building businesses. We don't want a war but we will retaliate. That's the narrative that India wants to tell the world that we don't want to be the aggressors here. is simply retaliating. But uh we're hoping that the world listens not just for our sake but for their own sake as well. Terror is the enemy of humanity, not just the enemy of India. Yeah. I you know I I think that um first of all I think you know the the nature of Indian media from the western perspective when they look out there is a lot of like breaking news headlines and there's a lot of flashy headlines that I think um you know is different to the way in which and that's that's the style of Indian journalism and Indian media but I do think that it's really important to in a thoughtful way you know in an impartial way tell the story of your country and your understanding of its role in geopolitics in the region in the wider international community and why India matters for um western capitals around the world I mean you look at the top CEOs in the United States they're all Indian nationals you know they're all um have a connection to India they all were either born in India or you know of are of Indian background and heritage So I do think it's important that that connection is made with the west the understanding of India's role in the world and and to your point that you know India's objective is not necessarily to be at war. India's objective is to export talent to the world and retain talent so that it can become you know this this hub of technology and growth in the region. Yeah. Um the other the other thing that you mentioned about uh President Trump saying that he was responsible for the ceasefire uh was met with a lot of backlash in India especially uh mainly because Pakistan broke the ceasefire an hour after President Trump's announcement uh and we also kind of feel that the the USA didn't have any role in this whole conflict. Uh I know that Pakistan was supported by China. So you would assume that because America and China are currently in the middle of what I believe is like cold war part two. You would assume that America would have helped India but there was no help given to us. Uh this is one of the other narratives that the world should know because I noticed that even on Pierce's show he he positioned America like it was the big brother in this whole situation. But the truth is uh there was nothing that President Trump said that affected this situation. I I just I guess you know we know that President Trump um operates in a transactional manner. He operates in the kind of art of the deal foreign policy. So he saw this as two equals fighting over a territory and come up with the solution. I'll help you was his response without fully grasping and understanding the the history the background um the nature of this conflict and it's it's not just about Kashmir being a flash point but at you know whether it's the Indian parliament being attacked whether it's the Mumbai uh terror attacks whether it's you know various other um military installations being targeted and attacked and then civilians being killed in Balgam um there is a kind of a a a a lack of understanding or frankly attention on this um situation at all from from the western capitals. And so I think that's that's where it's come from. And unfortunately in the art of the deal foreign policy approach, you do end up screwing over your friends. And while Delhi and Washington are friends and Washington sees Delhi as a reliable um partner perhaps um in in the region and for itself and to counter China in this rivalry at the end of the day Donald Trump is thinking I need this situation to be resolved. They're two nuclear armed nations. I don't need another war blowing up. I'm going to tell them both to to stop. And I think that was the approach. And perhaps India then at that point is thinking you know a this this isn't your war and b we can handle it ourselves here and and c you know why are you putting us on on equal footings was was my take on on how India responded. Yeah I think uh you've got it fairly right. Um and and you know I I guess what I would say is that um it's it the whole idea of India a nation of 1.4 four billion people. You know, again, it goes back to the point that it it sort of it is a massive democracy, the oldest democracy, the biggest democracy uh on the planet. And that is perhaps what people don't fully grasp and understand. There are election cycles and we're always in awe um of oh wow look at the way India has conducted their elections in terms of like 1.4 for a billion people going to the polls from all across the country and those are the moments that we tap into India and and sort of think oh this is quite extraordinary what it's done but but I guess it's it's it's how you present yourself um to the international community its relevance in in geopolitics and the opening up of access to officials again I I sort of talked about the fact that um whatever Pakistani officials were thinking about the interviews that I was conducting, they were still coming back every other day and wanting to talk about their side of the situation. Whether it was the interior minister, whether it was the high commissioner um in in uh the UK, whether it was the defense minister, they were Bawal, they were accessible, available every single day of the conflict for us um to be able to talk about their position. whether they liked the line of questioning or not, they took it uh you know on the chin and and they presented their their side of the story to the uh to the world. That's what you need from Indian officials. You need more people to come up and talk to global media. Yeah. I mean I think you know sometimes you know I mean I remember uh when the Congress party was was in power and Manamo Han Singh hadn't given an interview in in years or or a press conference you know it's sort of as a democracy you know the media is the fourth estate and I it's really important to hear uh from officials who are not afraid to come out and talk about their position um globally uh on the international stage you know and and to be able to take questions uh from journalists. I think that is really important to do and we were we were we couldn't believe the radio silence actually from the Indian side. Um you know I I was doing interview after interview after interview and we were after a while saying where are the Indian officials? Who do I contact to get them to tell us um what is happening on the other side? I think post this whole situation and the way you covered it and uh the objective manner in which you covered it I think that won you a lot of fans and admirers in our country as well. So there's a lot of questions that our people have for Yalda the human being and not Yaldahhim. Um so would love to know a bit of your story at least I mean whatever you're comfortable sharing. Sure. Um yeah, I mean I uh was born in Kbble um and um my father uh was studying architecture in what was Czechoslovakia at the time and he returned to the country and I was born and um he didn't want to stay in a country that had been destabilized by the Soviet uh occupation and he didn't want to serve in the military. So um they decided to leave the country and um myself and my two uh older uh brother and sister with alongside my mother left in the the sort of dead of night um from Afghanistan into Pakistan. They uh moved um you know traveled by horseback and on foot through people smugglers into Pakistan. um you know evading um the the mujahedin who were asking my my parents questions along the way u about what they were doing why they were leaving the the country evading um aerial bombardment um by the the Sovietbacked uh government and they fled into Pakistan uh where my mother who is a midwife uh she worked alongside an Austrian NGO in the Swat Valley and my father um was an set up an architectural firm in Islamabad. They stayed there for two years and my father knew an architect uh in Australia who um he wrote to and said, you know, I've got a young family and I'd like to leave the country. And so they sponsored my family to Australia and um then my family went to uh Australia and that's where I grew up. uh from the age of about three and a half. Um I was uh grew up in Sydney and then I was working as a journalist presenting a program on Australian television and um the head of the BBC saw my work, hired me. I moved to London and um where I worked for um 11 or 12 years and then um I was hired by by Sky um to to lead this foreign affairs uh program every evening and and then I travel. I'm on the road. I I cover big massive events uh for the network. when I um was starting off uh my career as a journalist um I first came to India and I traveled to Gujarat to Amdabad um convinced my parents that the network had sent me but they hadn't and I filmed a story um where um western women were using Indian wombs um as surrogates to have babies and then I went back to Delhi and I rang my mom and dad and I said you know the network are now sending me to Kbell and it was 2007 and it was the height of the like, you know, terrorist attacks across Afghanistan. The Taliban had regrouped and I I wanted to go to Afghanistan to to film the story and my parents completely flipped out. They freaked out and they said, "You are not leaving Delhi. You stay right there." And my mom and dad jumped on a plane, turned up in Delhi and I said, "Well, I'm going." And they came with me. Wow. So that was the first time my mother had returned in 20some years to the country um after not seeing her her family and and my father became they realized very quickly that no one had sent me. No network had sent me. It was me sort of with this this camera. So my father became my producer, my fixer, my security, um my translator. He became everything um in this three-week uh trip that we did uh to Afghanistan. And that became my big break when I went back to Australia. I said, "Hey, I was I just spent my holidays in in Kbble and and India." And they freaked out. They were like, "Oh my god, there was no insurance. You went into a war zone. No one commissioned this. We don't want these stories." And I said, "Well, I have these these tapes. You should look through them." And they looked through the India piece and they loved the piece and they said, "Okay, we're going to run this." And they looked through the Afghan material and they said it was extraordinary. and they we put we produced the piece together half an hour documentaries for both and uh it was the highest rating show of of the year and they sold it on they didn't they said to me we're not giving you a penny for this and I said sure don't worry about it I just want my material on air and um they they sold it on and it it was sort of sold internationally and they gave me a third of the the on sales um which I used then to travel to other parts until they they properly hired me and and I became part of the Uh, has your life ever been in danger over the course of all these adventures? Yeah, I mean, you know, I've I've um, like I said, I've covered extensively um the war in Afghanistan. Um, the uprisings in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine. I've u traveled in and out of Ukraine as the war has escalated over the course of the last few years. I've been in and out of um the war against ISIS in in Iraq. Um, so you know, I've been uh on the front lines. I've seen um what war and conflict does to people and the displacement of people. Um, and I've I've done work in in Pakistan. I've I've done um documentaries and films in India for example, many documentaries out of Afghanistan as well. So my bread and butter began in the region in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, but then it sort of expanded uh to across the globe. Um when was the last time you were in Pakistan? Pakistan now probably about seven years ago now. Um and and and actually again you know the the Pakistani government have reached out they've um offered me visas to go to the country. Uh they want to know when I'm coming. Um so despite the the criticism, despite um the the sort of fact that I'm fully aware and they know I'm aware, you know, because of my understanding of the region, because of my my passion for the region, um they know that I know the story and yet they say, "Come, we'll take you, we'll show you, um you know, uh we'll we'll give you a briefing. Come to Pakistan." Um so in the next uh few weeks um you know once I've gone back to London I I'll I'll probably be heading back to Pakistan. Okay. We invite you to India as well. Would love would love to take you around. I I would I would love to come to India as well and and I and again uh you know I think it's so important in journalism that you don't tell one side of the story that you know I'll travel to to Pakistan. I'll I'll I I'll hopefully u be able to come to to uh India and and get access uh to India to Indian officials and and be able to see uh for myself the situation. Yalda, you're of Afghan origin. Uh you grew up in Australia, you're currently working in the UK. Uh I think that you're a very strong neutral in this whole situation, especially considering all your work as a journalist. Um what do you see as the key differences between the two countries? I have been inside Dio Bundy madresses in Karachi. You know, I have spent time with the most extreme forms of these uh groups where they in seminaries, in madrases where there I have seen with my own eyes the indoctrination of young people and the justification of how they view the world and how they prosecute, you know, what they're doing um in terms of creating ing these hardliners in their country. And you know I I put to um one of the retired Pakistani generals I interviewed. I said he said to me you know come here you know come and see for yourself. Come and see our country. There is no Ja Muhammad. There is no Lashkar. And I said look in Bahalpur the leader of Ja Muhammad the founder of Jisha Muhammad whose core idea and the mindset is you know for them to take Kashmir back. They see that as their core fight. He the founder Masoud Azar said 10 members of my family have been killed. He himself said it. So young people who were taught in those madresses say that the madresses were cleared because we had intelligence that India was going to launch strikes on us. Where did they get the intelligence? Why you know um so that is what to the detriment of the Pakistani people the ISI has decided it it wants as its policy. Not only does it have nuclear weapons, but it also has decided that it wants to back and form these terrorist groups. These two things don't mix well together. And this is a very different offering from what India is and what India has become. And we spoke a little bit earlier on the podcast about the talent that India is exporting to the world. what it is creating for itself domestically and the offering for of the two nations is incredibly different and Washington has understood India's role in terms of its rivalry with China and therefore they have developed this extraordinary partnership bipartisan um partnership over the course of the last 25 years as India has emerged as not just a regional but a but a global player um And so I think it's important that Western capitalists understand um you know where terrorism um is bred from, why that's an issue, why it can become um you know an issue for the streets of London and New York. Um if if people don't fully grasp that it isn't just held and and confined to um the region to uh Afghanistan. I mean right now the relationship between the Pakistani government, the ISI and the Afghan Taliban which they um you know nurtured and and help uh grow and regroup and fund and brought their fighters to have bases in Pakistan and gave them space in their hospitals. And when the Taliban, Afghan Taliban took over Afghanistan again and NATO forces, the Americans had to leave and withdraw, we saw the ISI chief drinking tea on while Western capitals were in despair and trying to take their civilians out, trying to take their embassy staff out. 13 American servicemen and women were killed in a blast by ISISK in um outside of uh Kbell airport. The ISI chief was drinking tea at the Serena Hotel in Carbal and celebrating their win. And yet these are things whether it's Osama bin Laden, whether it's the clear acceptance that our boys are back in town I is is blatantly there and yet there is no accountability. Yeah. So um I think what you're trying to say is that the root cause of especially most of our conflicts in the subcontinent is this element of terrorism which is state sponsored especially in Pakistan. Um I was going to ask you if the world really cares about what's happening. It's a very direct raw question to you. Uh and if they don't then how do we make them care about it is another additional question. And another additional question is if the world is aware about everything that's happening in Balojasthan because in India uh the news is telling us that we're at the brink of seeing the birth of a new country in the form of Balojasthan. So I would love for you to answer all these three questions in terms of does the west care. Unfortunately I don't think they care. I think that you know when we see a headline 26 tourists killed I think they care. Um, but I think they put it to one side and say this is a an issue in the region and that's what it is and it's terrible and everybody moves on and we react in our newsrooms to the kind of news that our audiences want to hear. But also I think we have a responsibility and I often do stories around Sudan. We have an a brilliant correspondent who goes in and out of Sudan. Again, another forgotten story, forgotten war. We try and cover the situation in Yemen. We try and cover to the extent that we can what's happening on the ground in Gaza and we have uh teams in India who cover things like um the Pahelgam attack. So we try and bring that to the attention. But in terms of Baluchistan, one of the things that Pakistani officials always uh talk about is the fact that India um backs and funds when you throw the the terrorism thing at them, they will say India backs and funds uh the the Beluch liberation army and they are they have their own proxies and they use it against us as a state. I don't know to what extent Beluchistan is ready to become a state. I think that Pakistan would wouldn't allow that and I don't know you know again whether it's at the cusp of that I I think they they have um their issues there and you know Pakistan points the finger of blame on India for um giving um you know the Baluch Liberation Army um the means and the tools and backing and funding them and they say well they do that so therefore we do this um and and I don't know to what extent I don't know if it's accurate to say they're on the cusp of of having their own state. I don't think that's necessarily the case. Um I have had um you know quite interesting positive reaction and response from the Pakistanis as well because you have to understand that the the citizens of Pakistan you know outside of the army, the defense, the military are also fed up that this is a policy of the state. Even those people who are patriotic and even those people who try to flood the zone and say um you know of social media that that we we you know we we they want to defend their country and of course they do but at the same time I think they they grasp the fact that you know if India knows where Masud Azar is if India knows exactly where these camps are why doesn't Pakistan know and I think that is a a question that I I I put to uh these groups as Well, you know, these leaders that I've I've interviewed, if if if you know, the the the Financial Action Task Force, which is a body that traces and tracks state sponsoring of terrorism, said to Pakistan, you're on a gray list, you know, you need to crack down. You need to find out where the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks are. And suddenly he goes from being dead to being arrested. That in itself, you know, tells you tells you everything. And I think the Pakistani people are fed up with it and they do want to see fundamental change. But I am not sure what kind of hurry the ISI is to change its tact and and what they use as as a form of terrorism. Journalists have been driven out of Western journalists have been driven out of Pakistan. Uh you know Declan Walsh who worked for the New York Times lived in Pakistan for years. He did a number of stories about um the ISI's involvement with these terror groups and he was driven out of Pakistan and I think these sorts of stories aren't necessarily properly highlighted in India. Yeah. I mean the perspective of India here is that we are tired of everything that the ISI is doing like if every content creator in India who's covering geopolitical issues knows these truths how does the average Pakistani not know these truths? That's the question. Um and we're hoping that this whole um chapter in our history has taken out the truth to the world. Uh but speaking about history, the other thing I have wanted to ask you on a personal level is how you've covered the Israel Gaza issue. You've been to Ukraine yourself. U you've been a part of this India Pakistan conflict. Now um I know it's a bit of a direct question but in your eyes do you feel that we are on the brink of some kind of global conflict right now this year uh you know cuz when World War II was building up we didn't know that it was a world war that was building up and I use the term world war very cautiously but uh just on a very human level it's starting to seem like that from a global perspective there's way too many conflicts in the world Like I don't remember the last decade being like this but ever since 2020 I think it's a different time. Yeah. I think also our access to information has accelerated you know and people who understand history won't won't say this is an unprecedented moment in history because there is always something that triggers something bigger and I think what was worrying about the India Pakistan situation was that miscalculations lead to escalations which can lead to allout war and the danger was two nuclear armed states and that's why the world should have been sitting up and worried and paying paying attention and saying we don't want this to escalate because a nuclear war between between two rivals is not just dangerous for the two rivals, it's dangerous for the entire world. The situation for Ukraine and Russia, we can we saw how easily and quickly that was triggered. although it built up over a number of years from the annexation of Crimea um you know the the protests we saw in Maidan the the shifting of governments in Ukraine and then obviously Vladimir Putin denying that he was going to actually invade Ukraine proper and that's what he's done and he's annexed a lot of land. Um but there is also moments I think of hope. Yes, I think you're right. And one sort of miscalculation, misunderstanding can lead to escalation. And we are already seeing all sorts of cold wars simmering in different parts of the world which can lead to, you know, all out global war. You know, to think that an assassination somewhere could have le led to a global war. Um, anything can happen and anything can then trigger an allout war. Um, but I do think that there I've been on this trip following Donald Trump from uh Riyad, Saudi Arabia to Doha and then we've been trailing his trip as well to Abu Dhabi. What happened in Riyad with um Ahmed al- Shar, the now interim leader of Syria. He was a hardened jihadi. He was an al-Qaeda militant who spent time in one of the harshest American prisons, Abu Grae, in Iraq where, you know, there is no doubt that he has American blood on his hands. And yet he went back to Syria and formed this rebel group that then ended up toppling the Assad regime. And there is even reports that the Trump uh administration considered for a short period of time to assassinate him because he's this rebel leader who was taking over these militants were taking over Syria. And yet on Mon on Tuesday um we saw Donald Trump say that he was going to lift sanctions on Syria. On Wednesday he spent 30 minutes with Ahmed al- Shar. And after that meeting, he described him as a tough guy with a tough past, an attractive guy, you know, someone that the United States was willing to uh to work with and deal with. This is geopolitics. This is the nature of the world. the Iranians that who have for the longest time have had proxies that have operated in the Middle East um that have launched direct attacks on American bases um American embassies um American infrastructure. Now America is sitting with them and and coming up with a nuclear deal. And so I did an exclusive interview with Hamas yesterday where they said, "Yes, we're in direct talks. Hamas responsible for October 7 and killing of, you know, Israeli hostages and Israeli citizens inside Israel, which for the United States was an unforgivable move. And we've seen what's happened in Gaza since 60,000 people have been killed as a result. And I did this interview with Hamas yesterday at the hands, by the way, of Israel. Israeli air strikes have killed these 60,000 people. But I put to the Hamas leader that you triggered this by launching October 7 and you brought this hellfire on your own people. And he said to me, we are in direct talks with the United States. So what I'm trying to say is that the nature of the world whilst it feels scary and stressful while the information we're getting on a daily basis is that things are triggering everywhere and we saw another flash point in India and Pakistan how dangerous that was there is also things happening behind the scenes where negotiations are taking place to diffuse situations and to bring people out from the cold. But this idea that never again, a holocaust will never happen again, a world war one or two will never happen again, I think is false. And I think people who understand history know that we are on the cusp of something incredibly dangerous. And it can be triggered by a miscalculation, an escalation that can lead to an all-out war. But I'm also heartened by what I'm seeing in different parts of the world in terms of negotiations and deals to try and diffuse situations. discomforting answer. Um, we're almost at the end of this podcast. What What are your ending notes? I think that um, India is at a a at a different point in where it is in terms of where its standing is in the global community and it is offering something very different to Pakistan. And so I I'm often encouraged. I come to India once a year and I am encouraged by what I see in India, the development, the the pace at which it's going. And like all democracies, it has its problems. Um but I am encouraged by the development, the technology, the entrepreneurship, the enterprising nature of India, the startups that we're seeing, the nature of the startups, the conversations that are being had in India. Um it is quite extraordinary I think um where India is today and the growing middle class. Uh just want to say thank you at the end of this conversation. I began with a thank you on behalf of my country because we love you Yala Hakim. But uh at the end of the conversation again I just want to express my gratitude for your time.
