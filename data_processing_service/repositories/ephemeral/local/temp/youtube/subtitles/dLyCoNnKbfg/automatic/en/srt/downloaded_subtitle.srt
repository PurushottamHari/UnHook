1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,400
I 100% did not think that Huaja Af was

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,639
going to admit to me as the defense

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,679
minister of Pakistan that the state of

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,320
Pakistan has used terrorism as part of

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
their

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,119
policy. I think that if the world

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,800
doesn't sit up and take notice of

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,400
everything that's happening in Pakistan,

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
it's a matter of time before we see

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,560
another global terror attack at the

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
scale of everything that happened in

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,119
2001. Terror is the enemy of humanity,

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,119
not just the enemy of India. Barack

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,920
Obama and the United States in the dead

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,079
of night. They sent Navy Seals to the

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,399
country to take out Osama bin Laden and

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,640
didn't inform Pakistan tells you

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,960
everything about what conversations were

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,040
being had behind closed doors. If they

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,280
didn't understand it then, I don't think

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,320
they can understand it now. In Karachi,

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,000
I have seen with my own eyes the most

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,199
extreme forms of indoctrination of young

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,039
people and how they prosecute what

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,520
they're doing. I noticed that even on

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,680
Pierce's show, he positioned America

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,199
like it was the big brother, but the

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,799
truth is there was nothing that

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
President Trump said that affected this

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,560
situation. When President Trump said

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,119
there is a ceasefire, both sides have

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
spoken. India would have felt angry and

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,159
I don't want to speak on behalf of

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
India, but my understanding and reading

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,280
is that they are a great power. They

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,439
don't want other great powers tangled up

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
and Pakistan feels well, we are a weaker

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,960
nation. We're a smaller nation.

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,880
Therefore, we want China tangled up

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,600
here. We want the United States tangled

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,720
up.

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,280
Kala Hakeim is a lead world news

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,000
presenter on Sky News. She's become

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,040
extremely popular in India over the last

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,439
3 to four weeks because she's one of the

46
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,920
rare global news reporters who spoken

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,000
about the IndiaPakistan conflict. She

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,720
interviewed the defense minister of

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Pakistan, Quaja ASF. That clip went

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
viral in India. My intention with

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,320
bringing her on TRS is to ask her the

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,439
questions that India has with respect to

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,399
global media. But this whole episode is

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,200
an attempt to take India's voice out to

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,560
the globe as well. Without further ado,

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,560
this is a detailed conversation on

57
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,840
geopolitics with a focus on everything

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
that's happening between India and

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,760
Pakistan as we speak. Hope you gain a

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,760
lot of value from this episode.

61
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,930
[Music]

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Yaldahhim, welcome to the Reanir Show.

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,760
Uh, I have to begin by saying thank you

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,080
on behalf of our whole country. Thank

65
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,280
you, Reanir. Thank you. Um honestly I

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,040
I've been getting so many

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,200
um wonderful sort of remarks and

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,519
comments and and um really a lot of

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,040
warmth from India but I I I genuinely

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,280
just felt I was doing my job. Uh I think

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,879
the way Indians perceive it you were

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,920
being very objective. You were just

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,800
presenting facts and figures as uh every

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,040
world journalist should. Thank you. Um

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,120
and honestly I I I think you know one of

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,599
the things about being a journalist and

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,640
and you know I spent over a decade at

78
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,280
the BBC I'm at Sky now um the values

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,519
very much remain the same and and also

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
you know I have almost two decades of of

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,840
experience in the field certainly in the

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,080
um region in India Pakistan Afghanistan

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,280
um I mean I've worked across the globe

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
in places like Ukraine and North Africa

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,480
the Arab world and I'm currently um in

86
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,360
in Doha in Qatar following President

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,239
Trump's trip. Um so I think you know you

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,480
draw on um a sort of experience and

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,680
understanding of these regions as well.

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,280
Okay. Um we have to kind of begin by

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
speaking about the IndiaPakistan

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,360
situation from your eyes as of now.

93
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,920
You've covered it right from the start.

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,040
Uh your interview with Quaja AF the

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,040
Pakistan defense minister went viral all

96
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,599
over India. Honestly, it's become a

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,879
massive part of conversations here. So,

98
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,280
I would love to hear about the whole uh

99
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,959
experience from your perspective. Uh and

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,919
I'd love for you to highlight the Quaja

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,080
ASF interview as well. So Reanir um as

102
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,680
things were um simmering I mean if I go

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,919
back to uh Pelgam the the attack in

104
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Kashmir I really feel as though

105
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,800
newsrooms around the world certainly in

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,840
the western world don't quite understand

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,680
why Kashmir is a flash point why it is

108
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,400
one of the most militarized zones on the

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,720
planet so when the attack happened it

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,360
was sort of um a story that appeared and

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,600
broke on my show so I do a 9:00 uh in

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,120
the UK a um evening foreign affairs

113
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
show. It broke and our India

114
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,639
correspondent quickly put something

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,360
together to highlight that it it was had

116
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,600
happened and it sat somewhere within the

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
bulletin and immediately when I saw it I

118
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,199
was like wait a second this is a major

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,560
terrorist attack and you know 26 people

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,240
have died tourists innocent civilians so

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,759
we should be exploring this a little bit

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,560
more and again because our focus and

123
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,479
attention always is on you know what

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
President Trump is doing and what is

125
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,680
going on politically in our part of the

126
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,160
world. um it was kind of um dipping in

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
and out of conversation in our newsrooms

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
but wasn't dominating any kind of

129
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,120
conversation and and the newsrooms like

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,400
all newsrooms moved on quite quickly but

131
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,919
because I understand the intricacies

132
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,680
because I followed the issues around um

133
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,800
terrorism in India terrorism in Pakistan

134
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,759
um as I said for 15 plus years of my

135
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,080
career I was really keen to to continue

136
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,759
to highlight it. So 3 days after the uh

137
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,240
Pelgam attack, one of my producers um

138
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,199
said to me, "Oh, we might have the

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,639
defense minister of Pakistan. Um would

140
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
you be interested in speaking to him?"

141
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,759
And I said, "Absolutely. Let's get him

142
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,840
on. Let's talk to him." And you know,

143
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,560
India was was really ratcheting up the

144
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,199
rhetoric. India was angry. India had

145
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,280
promised to retaliate. India immediately

146
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,720
pointed the finger of blame on Pakistan.

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,360
And a lot of people couldn't understand

148
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,440
why. Why is the state of Pakistan being

149
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,080
blamed for a terrorist attack that

150
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,680
militants terrorists launched in Indian

151
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,000
administered Kashmir? They couldn't join

152
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,000
the dots. So when um initially the um

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,919
defense minister canled the interview

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,919
because they said they were holding a

155
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,960
national security council meeting and

156
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,600
the top cabinet meeting ministers in

157
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,280
Pakistan were meeting to discuss how

158
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,919
India was reacting to the terrorist

159
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,240
attack. So they canled it. The next day

160
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,319
they said actually we'll do it tonight.

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
And again I sort of thought this is

162
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,160
brave. This is interesting. Why is

163
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,160
Pakistan wanting to come out and talk

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:06,160
about this? Because I understood what

165
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:10,039
was going on. And I guess for the

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,880
longest time Pakistani officials feel

167
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,039
that accusations if a journalist is

168
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,039
somewhat aware about the the terrorism

169
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,280
connection between the ISI and and um

170
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,800
these terrorist groups they might raise

171
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,759
it and then Pakistan denies denies

172
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,520
denies and then everyone moves on. So I

173
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
prepared myself. I was really thinking

174
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,520
about the interview. Which angles can I

175
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,800
come into? And I 100% did not think that

176
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,800
Huaja Af was going to admit to me on air

177
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,840
as the current serving defense minister

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,639
of Pakistan that the state of Pakistan

179
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,680
has used terrorism as part of their

180
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,440
policy as part of their state craft. Of

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,520
course there is murkiness everywhere.

182
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,080
All states use proxies on some level,

183
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,919
but officials always come out and they

184
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,319
deny that they're doing it. They say

185
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,240
that these are groups that have issues

186
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,319
with um governments. They launch these

187
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,280
attacks. It has nothing to do with us.

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,680
So when I sat across or you know we we

189
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,919
patched up with Huaja Af and I began

190
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
asking the questions and I said to him

191
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,680
India's pointing the finger of blame and

192
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,759
he said I don't know why they're blaming

193
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
us. This is India's problem. you know,

194
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,759
we we condemn this terrorist attack, but

195
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,759
it's got nothing to do with us. And I

196
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,240
thought I'm going to obviously ask the

197
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,360
question that you do admit though that

198
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,120
you have had a history Pakistan has had

199
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,399
a history of uh state sponsor sponsoring

200
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,240
of of terrorism to this day. Anyone who

201
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
is following Pakistan, anyone who is

202
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
following the history of Pakistan

203
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,040
understands this. And in the past,

204
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,519
Pakistani officials have um when they

205
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,440
have um stepped down from their posts,

206
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,480
they have admitted this. Whether it is

207
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,640
the former ISI chief, you know, General

208
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Durani, whether it's Perez Musharov,

209
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,880
whether it's Benazir Bruto, when they

210
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,760
step down, yeah, they talk about it.

211
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,200
Yeah, we used it. It's part of our state

212
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,000
craft. I did not think the serving

213
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,399
defense minister of Pakistan would say,

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,720
"Yes, this is what we do. This is what

215
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,480
we have. This is why we use it." And

216
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,880
it's not just us. We're doing the dirty

217
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,440
work of you, the West. What did you make

218
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,360
of it the moment he said that? Like what

219
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,279
was your first thought? As a journalist

220
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
who's been around for a while, you

221
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,279
understand how the world of geopolitics

222
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,320
works. So I'd love to know about your

223
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,959
mind in that situation. I I I realized

224
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,600
immediately that it was extraordinary.

225
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,480
And I thought maybe he didn't quite

226
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,279
process what I was saying. Maybe I

227
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,880
misunderstood him. So I wanted clarity

228
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,800
and I pushed him again initially. I mean

229
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,519
you know a lot of people have sort of

230
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,440
replayed the interview and captured my

231
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,640
initial reaction in that moment because

232
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,320
I I did jolt. I I sort of you know I I

233
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,800
sort of couldn't believe what I was

234
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,880
hearing uh that he was saying you know

235
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,920
well we did the dirty work of the west

236
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,399
and yes we have these proxies and they

237
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,240
exist and this is how it is. So I did

238
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,560
jolt and I said,"Well, is that is that

239
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,279
your justification? You know, is this

240
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,959
you're justifying now that Pakistan has

241
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
this connection with terrorist groups

242
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,120
because we're going back to the

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
mujahedin, the CIA, and the dirty work

244
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,120
of then. So it's now just part of what

245
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,560
Pakistan does." And he said, "No, this

246
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,040
is the reason why you're saying this to

247
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,680
me." And he he he again for the

248
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,000
interview went for about 18 minutes and

249
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,519
he didn't back down at any point. He

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
made it clear to me that he understood

251
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
what I was saying. he was going to say

252
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920
what he was going to say and that is

253
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,600
that Pakistan has had the longest

254
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,839
history and what has been the underbelly

255
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,279
and and the so-called deep state of

256
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,000
Pakistan and how they operate. Yeah. Um

257
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,839
considering that this conflict has gone

258
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,720
on for the last couple of weeks, my

259
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,000
question to you is uh more from a global

260
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,279
perspective, do you think the world

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,839
understands exactly what's happening in

262
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,240
the subcontinent at this point? And do

263
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,720
they also kind of remember that Osama

264
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,120
bin Laden was found in Pakistan and is

265
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,680
that a thought bubble for the rest of

266
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,120
the world? So like I said first of all I

267
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
think there's a lack of understanding

268
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,040
and the lack of understanding comes from

269
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,040
a lack of access and the lack of access

270
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,560
comes because India their policy is why

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,720
should we justify ourselves to the

272
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,519
world? We are a great power. We are a a

273
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,079
superpower in not just the region but

274
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,480
globally. We have had this bipartisan

275
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,800
relationship with the United States for

276
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,200
25 years. We are, you know, a power in

277
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,120
the region that the United States wants

278
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,720
to partner with to counter China, for

279
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,399
example. But I think what was quite

280
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,560
extraordinary when we saw President

281
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,720
Trump put out that statement on Truth

282
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Social and said there is a ceasefire.

283
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,279
Both sides have spoken and now I think

284
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,200
that they should make a deal on Kashmir.

285
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:08,399
That is something that India would have

286
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,079
you know felt angry because they their

287
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,079
feeling and I don't want to speak on

288
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,800
behalf of India but my understanding and

289
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,760
reading is that we are not on equal

290
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,160
footings. We are a great power. Pakistan

291
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,639
is a much weaker power. We don't want

292
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,560
other great powers tangled up in our

293
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,200
backyard. We want to deal with our

294
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,040
issues ourselves. And Pakistan feels

295
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
well we are a weaker nation. We're a

296
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,200
smaller nation. Therefore, we want other

297
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
great powers. We want China tangled up

298
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
here. We want the United States tangled

299
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,160
up here, you know. And so these this

300
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,399
sort of complexity isn't fully grasped,

301
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,040
I don't think, by the US president who

302
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,519
came out and said that. I don't think um

303
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,880
Western audiences fully understand. And

304
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,760
for me, why I believe it matters is

305
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,760
because when a state is a state sponsor

306
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,639
of terrorism and was on a grrey list and

307
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,079
Osama bin Laden was discovered there, if

308
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,279
the West doesn't hold the state

309
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,519
accountable and when Osama bin Laden in

310
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:10,399
2012 was was discovered just a stone

311
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,000
throw away from a military uh

312
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,880
headquarters and base, the CIA director

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,920
at the time said either Pakistan was

314
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,440
implicit or it was incompetent. And at

315
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,240
the time Pakistan pleaded, the ISI

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,639
pleaded incompetence. They would rather

317
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,240
say we didn't know that he was right

318
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,320
there than say yes sure, we were aware

319
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,320
and we let him stay there and we

320
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,120
harbored him and we backed him. And the

321
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,200
fact that at that point in time, Barack

322
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,839
Obama and the United States didn't hold

323
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,399
Pakistan accountable. In the dead of

324
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,560
night, they sent Navy Seals to the

325
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,360
country to take out Osama bin Laden and

326
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,279
didn't inform their ally Pakistan and

327
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,560
and their partner Pakistan in the war on

328
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,199
terror that we're doing this because

329
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,519
they were so worried that the operation

330
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
would fall apart, that somehow Osama bin

331
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,519
Laden would be tipped off and that he

332
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,079
wouldn't be there when the Navy Seals uh

333
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,399
got there. tells you everything about

334
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,560
the the what conversations were being

335
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,680
had behind closed doors. If they didn't

336
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,279
understand it then the role of the ISI

337
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,279
and they still continue to give them

338
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,040
billions of dollars, I don't think they

339
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,600
can understand it now. Yeah. Uh some key

340
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,360
points I wish to bring up again. I think

341
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,480
that if the world doesn't sit up and

342
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,399
take notice of everything that's

343
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,720
happening in Pakistan, it's a matter of

344
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,959
time before we see another global terror

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,160
attack at the scale of everything that

346
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,079
happened in 2001 and the early 2000s. Uh

347
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,600
it has become a terror hub for the

348
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,160
world. Uh it's just that in India we

349
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,680
know about the Lashkar Tibad, the Jes

350
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
Muhammad because the terrorist attacks

351
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,320
are targeted towards us. But the nature

352
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,160
of terrorism is such that eventually

353
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
it's not going to be limited to one

354
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,360
target country. It has the potential to

355
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,839
spread all across the globe. And India's

356
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,519
main narrative to the world is hey we

357
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,720
are a GDP that's 11 times the size of

358
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,160
Pakistan because we're focused on our

359
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,360
own economy. We're focused on job

360
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,560
creation. We're focused on building

361
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,240
businesses. We don't want a war but we

362
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,320
will retaliate. That's the narrative

363
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,399
that India wants to tell the world that

364
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,600
we don't want to be the aggressors here.

365
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,839
is simply retaliating. But uh we're

366
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
hoping that the world listens not just

367
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,240
for our sake but for their own sake as

368
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,560
well. Terror is the enemy of humanity,

369
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,360
not just the enemy of India. Yeah. I you

370
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,600
know I I think that um first of all I

371
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,240
think you know the the nature of Indian

372
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,240
media from the western perspective when

373
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,000
they look out there is a lot of like

374
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,120
breaking news headlines and there's a

375
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
lot of flashy headlines that I think um

376
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,560
you know is different to the way in

377
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,959
which and that's that's the style of

378
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,040
Indian journalism and Indian media but I

379
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,680
do think that it's really important to

380
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,000
in a thoughtful way you know in an

381
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,639
impartial way tell the story of your

382
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,040
country and your understanding of its

383
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:07,759
role in geopolitics in the region in the

384
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,920
wider international community and why

385
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,519
India matters for um western capitals

386
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,079
around the world I mean you look at the

387
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,240
top CEOs in the United States they're

388
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,880
all Indian nationals you know they're

389
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,160
all um have a connection to India they

390
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,880
all were either born in India or you

391
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,880
know of are of Indian background and

392
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,800
heritage So I do think it's important

393
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,279
that that connection is made with the

394
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,320
west the understanding of India's role

395
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,639
in the world and and to your point that

396
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,160
you know India's objective is not

397
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,360
necessarily to be at war. India's

398
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,720
objective is to export talent to the

399
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,120
world and retain talent so that it can

400
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,399
become you know this this hub of

401
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,519
technology and growth in the region.

402
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,839
Yeah. Um the other the other thing that

403
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,480
you mentioned about uh President Trump

404
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,280
saying that he was responsible for the

405
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,400
ceasefire uh was met with a lot of

406
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,120
backlash in India especially uh mainly

407
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,559
because Pakistan broke the ceasefire an

408
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,520
hour after President Trump's

409
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,760
announcement uh and we also kind of feel

410
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:23,480
that the the USA didn't have any role in

411
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,640
this whole conflict. Uh I know that

412
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,120
Pakistan was supported by China. So you

413
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,360
would assume that because America and

414
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,520
China are currently in the middle of

415
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,360
what I believe is like cold war part

416
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,720
two. You would assume that America would

417
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
have helped India but there was no help

418
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,120
given to us. Uh this is one of the other

419
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,360
narratives that the world should know

420
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,039
because I noticed that even on Pierce's

421
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,559
show he he positioned America like it

422
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,240
was the big brother in this whole

423
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,520
situation. But the truth is

424
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,280
uh there was nothing that President

425
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,559
Trump said that affected this situation.

426
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,640
I I just I guess you know we know that

427
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,799
President Trump um operates in a

428
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,520
transactional manner. He operates in the

429
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,960
kind of art of the deal foreign policy.

430
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,799
So he saw this as two equals fighting

431
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,679
over a territory and come up with the

432
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,520
solution. I'll help you was his response

433
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,840
without fully grasping and understanding

434
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,039
the the history the background um the

435
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,919
nature of this conflict and it's it's

436
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,480
not just about Kashmir being a flash

437
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,000
point but at you know whether it's the

438
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
Indian parliament being attacked whether

439
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,280
it's the Mumbai uh terror attacks

440
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,280
whether it's you know various other um

441
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,360
military installations being targeted

442
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,720
and attacked and then civilians being

443
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,840
killed in Balgam um there is a kind of a

444
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,600
a a a lack of understanding or frankly

445
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,960
attention on this um situation at all

446
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,320
from from the western capitals. And so I

447
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,520
think that's that's where it's come

448
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,320
from. And unfortunately in the art of

449
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,280
the deal foreign policy approach, you do

450
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,600
end up screwing over your friends. And

451
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,799
while Delhi and Washington are friends

452
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,960
and Washington sees Delhi as a reliable

453
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,280
um partner perhaps um in in the region

454
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,760
and for itself and to counter China in

455
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,919
this rivalry at the end of the day

456
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,600
Donald Trump is thinking I need this

457
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,000
situation to be resolved. They're two

458
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,080
nuclear armed nations. I don't need

459
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,760
another war blowing up. I'm going to

460
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,080
tell them both to to stop. And I think

461
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,559
that was the approach. And perhaps India

462
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,679
then at that point is thinking you know

463
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,320
a this this isn't your war and b we can

464
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,320
handle it ourselves here and and c you

465
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,799
know why are you putting us on on equal

466
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,679
footings was was my take on on how India

467
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,120
responded. Yeah I think uh you've got it

468
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,720
fairly right. Um and and you know I I

469
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,919
guess what I would say is that um it's

470
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,960
it the whole idea of India a nation of

471
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,679
1.4 four billion people. You know,

472
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,960
again, it goes back to the point that it

473
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,280
it sort of it is a massive democracy,

474
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,919
the oldest democracy, the biggest

475
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,480
democracy uh on the planet. And that is

476
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,919
perhaps what people don't fully grasp

477
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,200
and understand. There are election

478
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,360
cycles and we're always in awe um of oh

479
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,000
wow look at the way India has conducted

480
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,240
their elections in terms of like 1.4 for

481
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,200
a billion people going to the polls from

482
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,000
all across the country and those are the

483
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,520
moments that we tap into India and and

484
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,840
sort of think oh this is quite

485
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,919
extraordinary what it's done but but I

486
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,760
guess it's it's it's how you present

487
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,120
yourself um to the international

488
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,440
community its relevance in in

489
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,240
geopolitics and the opening up of access

490
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,880
to officials again I I sort of talked

491
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,520
about the fact that um whatever

492
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,360
Pakistani officials were thinking about

493
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,200
the interviews that I was conducting,

494
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
they were still coming back every other

495
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,240
day and wanting to talk about their side

496
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,679
of the situation. Whether it was the

497
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,720
interior minister, whether it was the

498
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,640
high commissioner um in in uh the UK,

499
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,280
whether it was the defense minister,

500
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,039
they were Bawal, they were accessible,

501
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,360
available every single day of the

502
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,840
conflict for us um to be able to talk

503
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,919
about their position. whether they liked

504
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,480
the line of questioning or not, they

505
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,240
took it uh you know on the chin and and

506
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
they presented their their side of the

507
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,039
story to the uh to the world. That's

508
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
what you need from Indian officials. You

509
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,240
need more people to come up and talk to

510
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
global media. Yeah. I mean I think you

511
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,400
know sometimes you know I mean I

512
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,039
remember uh when the Congress party was

513
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,520
was in power and Manamo Han Singh hadn't

514
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,679
given an interview in in years or or a

515
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,480
press conference you know it's sort of

516
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,679
as a democracy you know the media is the

517
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,039
fourth estate and I it's really

518
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,799
important to hear uh from officials who

519
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,080
are not afraid to come out and talk

520
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,159
about their position um globally uh on

521
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,720
the international stage you know and and

522
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,240
to be able to take questions uh from

523
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,039
journalists. I think that is really

524
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,640
important to do and we were we were we

525
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,200
couldn't believe the radio silence

526
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,720
actually from the Indian side. Um you

527
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,320
know I I was doing interview after

528
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,400
interview after interview and we were

529
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,480
after a while saying where are the

530
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,360
Indian officials? Who do I contact to

531
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,039
get them to tell us um what is happening

532
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,000
on the other side?

533
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,320
I think post this whole situation and

534
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,240
the way you covered it and uh the

535
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,559
objective manner in which you covered it

536
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,640
I think that won you a lot of fans and

537
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,720
admirers in our country as well. So

538
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,520
there's a lot of questions that our

539
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,360
people have for Yalda the human being

540
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,280
and not Yaldahhim. Um so would love to

541
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
know a bit of your story at least I mean

542
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,159
whatever you're comfortable sharing.

543
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,919
Sure. Um yeah, I mean I uh was born in

544

547
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,960
returned to the country and I was born

548
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,039
and um he didn't want to stay in a

549
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,039
country that had been destabilized by

550
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,679
the Soviet uh occupation and he didn't

551
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,880
want to serve in the military. So um

552
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:12,080

questions along the way u about what

562
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,840
they were doing why they were leaving

563
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,039

572
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,640
knew an architect uh in

573
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,559

you know, I've got a young family and

575
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,120
I'd like to leave the country. And so

576
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,320
they sponsored my family to Australia

577
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,120
and um then my family went to uh

578
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,039
Australia and that's where I grew up. uh

579
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,440
from the age of about three and a half.

580
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:27,440
Um I was uh grew up in Sydney and then I

581
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,240
was working as a journalist presenting a

582
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,960
program on Australian television and um

583
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,760
the head of the BBC saw my work, hired

584
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,360
me. I moved to London and um where I

585
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,720
worked for um 11 or 12 years and then um

586
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,120
I was hired by by Sky um to to lead this

587
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,279
foreign affairs uh program every evening

588
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,320
and and then I travel. I'm on the road.

589
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,200
I I cover big massive events uh for the

590
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,679
network. when I um was starting off uh

591
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,200
my career as a journalist um I first

592
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,000
came to India and I traveled to Gujarat

593
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,000
to Amdabad um convinced my parents that

594
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,919
the network had sent me but they hadn't

595
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,799
and I filmed a story um where um western

596
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,960
women were using Indian wombs um as

597
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,799
surrogates to have babies and then I

598
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
went back to Delhi and I rang my mom and

599
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,600
dad and I said you know the network are

600
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,320
now sending me to Kbell and it was 2007

601
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,760
and it was the height of the like, you

602
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
know, terrorist attacks across

603
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,880
Afghanistan. The Taliban had regrouped

604
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,039
and I I wanted to go to Afghanistan to

605
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,360
to film the story and my parents

606
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,480
completely flipped out. They freaked out

607
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,720
and they said, "You are not leaving

608
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,640
Delhi. You stay right there." And my mom

609
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,039
and dad jumped on a plane, turned up in

610
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,679
Delhi and I said, "Well, I'm going." And

611
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,559
they came with me. Wow. So that was the

612
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,600
first time my mother had returned in

613
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,919
20some years to the country um after not

614
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,080
seeing her her family and and my father

615
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,320
became they realized very quickly that

616
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,640
no one had sent me. No network had sent

617
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,799
me. It was me sort of with this this

618
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,000
camera. So my father became my producer,

619
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,080
my fixer, my security, um my translator.

620
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,240
He became everything um in this

621
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,799
three-week uh trip that we did uh to

622
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,799
Afghanistan. And that became my big

623
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,320
break when I went back to Australia. I

624
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,480
said, "Hey, I was I just spent my

625
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,559
holidays in in Kbble and and India." And

626
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,080
they freaked out. They were like, "Oh my

627
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,919
god, there was no insurance. You went

628
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,919
into a war zone. No one commissioned

629
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,240
this. We don't want these stories." And

630
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,840
I said, "Well, I have these these tapes.

631
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,360
You should look through them." And they

632
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,799
looked through the India piece and they

633
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,159
loved the piece and they said, "Okay,

634
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,080
we're going to run this." And they

635
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,000
looked through the Afghan material and

636
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,159
they said it was extraordinary. and they

637
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
we put we produced the piece together

638
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,480
half an hour documentaries for both and

639
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,120
uh it was the highest rating show of of

640
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,400
the year and they sold it on they didn't

641
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,840
they said to me we're not giving you a

642
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
penny for this and I said sure don't

643
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,679
worry about it I just want my material

644
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,159
on air and um they they sold it on and

645
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,240
it it was sort of sold internationally

646
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,559
and they gave me a third of the the on

647
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,400
sales um which I used then to travel to

648
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,440
other parts until they they properly

649
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,200
hired me and and I became part of the

650
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,039
Uh, has your life ever been in danger

651
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
over the course of all these adventures?

652
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah, I mean, you know, I've I've um,

653
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,159
like I said, I've covered extensively um

654
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,480
the war in Afghanistan. Um, the

655
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,840
uprisings in the Middle East, the war in

656
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,000
Ukraine. I've u traveled in and out of

657
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,240
Ukraine as the war has escalated over

658
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,720
the course of the last few years. I've

659
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,000
been in and out of um the war against

660
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,799
ISIS in in Iraq. Um, so you know, I've

661
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,600
been uh on the front lines. I've seen um

662
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,720
what war and conflict does to people and

663
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,960
the displacement of people. Um, and I've

664
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,440
I've done work in in Pakistan. I've I've

665
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,279
done um documentaries and films in India

666
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,000
for example, many documentaries out of

667
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,480
Afghanistan as well. So my bread and

668
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,039
butter began in the region in India,

669
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,399
Afghanistan, Pakistan, but then it sort

670
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,760
of expanded uh to across the globe. Um

671
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,919
when was the last time you were in

672
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,640
Pakistan? Pakistan now probably about

673
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,480
seven years ago now. Um and and and

674
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,080
actually again you know the the

675
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Pakistani government have reached out

676
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,640
they've um offered me visas to go to the

677
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,159
country. Uh they want to know when I'm

678
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,360
coming. Um so despite the the criticism,

679
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,000
despite um the the sort of fact that I'm

680
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,559
fully aware and they know I'm aware, you

681
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,039
know, because of my understanding of the

682
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,559
region, because of my my passion for the

683
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:35,200
region, um they know that I know the

684
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,440
story and yet they say, "Come, we'll

685
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,080
take you, we'll show you, um you know,

686
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,120
uh we'll we'll give you a briefing. Come

687
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,120
to Pakistan." Um so in the next uh few

688
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,960
weeks um you know once I've gone back to

689
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,919
London I I'll I'll probably be heading

690
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,399
back to Pakistan. Okay. We invite you to

691
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,399
India as well. Would love would love to

692
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,559
take you around. I I would I would love

693
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,360
to come to India as well and and I and

694
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,120
again uh you know I think it's so

695
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,279
important in journalism that you don't

696
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,919
tell one side of the story that you know

697
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,480
I'll travel to to Pakistan. I'll I'll I

698
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,520
I'll hopefully u be able to come to to

699
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,520
uh India and and get access uh to India

700
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,799
to Indian officials and and be able to

701
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,679
see uh for myself the situation. Yalda,

702
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,960
you're of Afghan origin. Uh you grew up

703
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,159
in Australia, you're currently working

704
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,159
in the UK. Uh I think that you're a very

705
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,520
strong neutral in this whole situation,

706
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,799
especially considering all your work as

707
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,919
a journalist.

708
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,760
Um what do you see as the key

709
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,320
differences between the two countries? I

710
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,120
have been inside Dio Bundy madresses in

711
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:45,120
Karachi. You know, I have spent time

712
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:48,039
with the most extreme forms of these uh

713
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,600
groups where they in seminaries, in

714
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:54,960
madrases where there I have seen with my

715
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,799
own eyes the indoctrination of young

716
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:03,600
people and the justification of how they

717
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:06,520
view the world and how they prosecute,

718
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,919
you know, what they're doing um in terms

719
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:13,600
of creating ing these hardliners in

720
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,720
their country. And you know I I put to

721
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,600
um one of the retired Pakistani generals

722
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,840
I interviewed. I said he said to me you

723
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,520
know come here you know come and see for

724
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,200
yourself. Come and see our country.

725
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,799
There is no Ja Muhammad. There is no

726
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,559
Lashkar. And I said look in Bahalpur the

727
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,880
leader of Ja Muhammad the founder of

728
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:38,880
Jisha Muhammad whose core idea and the

729
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,880
mindset is you know for them to take

730
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,600
Kashmir back. They see that as their

731
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,840
core fight. He the founder Masoud Azar

732
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,679
said 10 members of my family have been

733
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,880
killed. He himself said it.

734
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:56,640
So young people who were taught in those

735
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,039
madresses say that the madresses were

736
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,960
cleared because we had intelligence that

737
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,120
India was going to launch strikes on us.

738
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,919
Where did they get the intelligence? Why

739
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,080
you know um so that is

740
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:13,760
what to the detriment of the Pakistani

741
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,960
people the ISI has decided it it wants

742
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,919
as its policy. Not only does it have

743
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,559
nuclear weapons, but it also has decided

744
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,960
that it wants to back and form these

745
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,440
terrorist groups. These two things don't

746
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,919
mix well together. And this is a very

747
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,159
different offering from what India is

748
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,919
and what India has become. And we spoke

749
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,799
a little bit earlier on the podcast

750
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,279
about the talent that India is exporting

751
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,640
to the world. what it is creating for

752
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,799
itself domestically and the offering for

753
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,799
of the two nations is incredibly

754
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:54,240
different and Washington has understood

755
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,799
India's role in terms of its rivalry

756
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,200
with China and therefore they have

757
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,840
developed this extraordinary partnership

758
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,799
bipartisan um partnership over the

759
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,679
course of the last 25 years as India has

760
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,200
emerged as not just a regional but a but

761
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,720
a global player um And so I think it's

762
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,720
important that Western capitalists

763
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,039
understand um you know where terrorism

764
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,760
um is bred from, why that's an issue,

765
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,360
why it can become um you know an issue

766
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,080
for the streets of London and New York.

767
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,559
Um if if people don't fully grasp that

768
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:36,640
it isn't just held and and confined to

769
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:40,640
um the region to uh Afghanistan. I mean

770
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,279
right now the relationship between the

771
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,919
Pakistani government, the ISI and the

772
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,519
Afghan Taliban which they um you know

773
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,000
nurtured and and help uh grow and

774
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,840
regroup and fund and brought their

775
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,399
fighters to have bases in Pakistan and

776
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,279
gave them space in their hospitals. And

777
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,640
when the Taliban, Afghan Taliban took

778
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,960
over Afghanistan again and NATO forces,

779
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,559
the Americans had to leave and withdraw,

780
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,720
we saw the ISI chief drinking tea on

781
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,640
while Western capitals were in despair

782
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,039
and trying to take their civilians out,

783
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,600
trying to take their embassy staff out.

784
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,799
13 American servicemen and women were

785
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,720
killed in a blast by

786
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:28,880
ISISK in um outside of uh Kbell airport.

787
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,039
The ISI chief was drinking tea at the

788
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,679
Serena Hotel in Carbal and celebrating

789
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,360
their win. And yet these are things

790
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,840
whether it's Osama bin Laden, whether

791
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,799
it's the clear acceptance that our boys

792
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,679
are back in town I is is blatantly there

793
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,399
and yet there is no accountability.

794
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,240
Yeah. So um I think what you're trying

795
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,559
to say is that the root cause of

796
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,840
especially most of our conflicts in the

797
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:56,320
subcontinent is this element of

798
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,960
terrorism which is state sponsored

799
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,960
especially in Pakistan. Um I was going

800
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,440
to ask you if the world really cares

801
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,799
about what's happening. It's a very

802
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,639
direct raw question to you. Uh and if

803
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,040
they don't then how do we make them care

804
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,040
about it is another additional question.

805
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,399
And another additional question is if

806
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,639
the world is aware about everything

807
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,200
that's happening in Balojasthan because

808
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,520
in India uh the news is telling us that

809
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,399
we're at the brink of seeing the birth

810
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,919
of a new country in the form of

811
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,079
Balojasthan. So I would love for you to

812
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,919
answer all these three questions in

813
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,000
terms of does the west care.

814
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,280
Unfortunately I don't think they care. I

815
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,440
think that you know when we see a

816
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,520
headline 26 tourists killed I think they

817
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,399
care. Um, but I think they put it to one

818
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,320
side and say this is a an issue in the

819
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,960
region and that's what it is and it's

820
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,679
terrible and everybody moves on and we

821
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,320
react in our newsrooms to the kind of

822
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,159
news that our audiences want to hear.

823
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,159
But also I think we have a

824
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,480
responsibility and I often do stories

825
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,839
around Sudan. We have an a brilliant

826
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,920
correspondent who goes in and out of

827
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,920
Sudan. Again, another forgotten story,

828
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,480
forgotten war. We try and cover the

829
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,000
situation in Yemen. We try and cover to

830
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,560
the extent that we can what's happening

831
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,200
on the ground in Gaza and we have uh

832
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,760
teams in India who cover things like um

833
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,119
the Pahelgam attack. So we try and bring

834
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,960
that to the attention. But in terms of

835
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,520
Baluchistan, one of the things that

836
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,119
Pakistani officials always uh talk about

837
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,280
is the fact that India um backs and

838
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,079
funds when you throw the the terrorism

839
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,640
thing at them, they will say India backs

840
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,040
and funds uh the the Beluch liberation

841
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,119
army and they are they have their own

842
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,680
proxies and they use it against us as a

843
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,079
state. I don't know to what extent

844
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,920
Beluchistan is ready to become a state.

845
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,079
I think that Pakistan would wouldn't

846
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,400
allow that and I don't know you know

847
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,440
again whether it's at the cusp of that I

848
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,240
I think they they have um their issues

849
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,440
there and you know Pakistan points the

850
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,000
finger of blame on India for um giving

851
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,760
um you know the Baluch Liberation Army

852
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,520
um the means and the tools and backing

853
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,079
and funding them and they say well they

854
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,720
do that so therefore we do this um and

855
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,560
and I don't know to what extent I don't

856
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,640
know if it's accurate to say they're on

857
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,880
the cusp of of having their own state. I

858
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,640
don't think that's necessarily the case.

859
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Um I have had um you know quite

860
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,040
interesting positive reaction and

861
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,800
response from the Pakistanis as well

862
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,280
because you have to understand that the

863
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,960
the citizens of Pakistan you know

864
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,760
outside of the army, the defense, the

865
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,800
military are also fed up that this is a

866
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,960
policy of the state. Even those people

867
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,480
who are patriotic and even those people

868
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,839
who try to flood the zone and say um you

869
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,359
know of social media that that we we you

870
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,520
know we we they want to defend their

871
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,839
country and of course they do but at the

872
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,560
same time I think they they grasp the

873
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,680
fact that you know if India knows where

874
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,760
Masud Azar is if India knows exactly

875
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,320
where these camps are why doesn't

876
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,560
Pakistan know and I think that is a a

877
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,720
question that I I I put to uh these

878
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,920
groups as Well, you know, these leaders

879
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,400
that I've I've interviewed, if if if you

880
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,720
know, the the the Financial Action Task

881
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,960
Force, which is a body that traces and

882
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,440
tracks state sponsoring of terrorism,

883
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,760
said to Pakistan, you're on a gray list,

884
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,560
you know, you need to crack down. You

885
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,640
need to find out where the mastermind of

886
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,440
the Mumbai attacks are. And suddenly he

887
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,680
goes from being dead to being arrested.

888
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,040
That in itself, you know, tells you

889
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,760
tells you everything. And I think the

890
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,400
Pakistani people are fed up with it and

891
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,200
they do want to see fundamental change.

892
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,800
But I am not sure what kind of hurry the

893
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,040
ISI is to change its tact and and what

894
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,040
they use as as a form of terrorism.

895
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,480
Journalists have been driven out of

896
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,960
Western journalists have been driven out

897
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,880
of Pakistan. Uh you know Declan Walsh

898
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,880
who worked for the New York Times lived

899
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,200
in Pakistan for years. He did a number

900
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,640
of stories about um the ISI's

901
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,440
involvement with these terror groups and

902
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,520
he was driven out of Pakistan and I

903
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,280
think these sorts of stories aren't

904
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,599
necessarily properly highlighted in

905
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,000
India. Yeah. I mean the perspective of

906
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,480
India here is that we are tired of

907
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,320
everything that the ISI is doing like if

908
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,240
every content creator in India who's

909
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,240
covering geopolitical issues knows these

910
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,680
truths how does the average Pakistani

911
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,800
not know these truths? That's the

912
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:30,480
question. Um and we're hoping that this

913
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,599
whole um chapter in our history has

914
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,160
taken out the truth to the world. Uh but

915
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,680
speaking about history, the other thing

916
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,079
I have wanted to ask you on a personal

917
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,920
level is how you've covered the Israel

918
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,079
Gaza issue. You've been to Ukraine

919
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,160
yourself. U you've been a part of this

920
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,240
India Pakistan conflict. Now

921
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,440
um I know it's a bit of a direct

922
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,160
question but in your eyes do you feel

923
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,240
that we are on the brink of some kind of

924
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,240
global conflict right now this year uh

925
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,920
you know cuz when World War II was

926
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,000
building up we didn't know that it was a

927
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,200
world war that was building up and I use

928
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,200
the term world war very cautiously but

929
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,880
uh just on a very human level it's

930
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,320
starting to seem like that from a global

931
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,480
perspective there's way too many

932
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,880
conflicts in the world Like I don't

933
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,200
remember the last decade being like this

934
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,880
but ever since 2020 I think it's a

935
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,240
different time. Yeah. I think also our

936
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,000
access to information has accelerated

937
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,119
you know and people who understand

938
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
history won't won't say this is an

939
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,640
unprecedented moment in history because

940
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,320
there is always something that triggers

941
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,000
something bigger and I think what was

942
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,800
worrying about the India Pakistan

943
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,040
situation was that miscalculations lead

944
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,680
to escalations which can lead to allout

945
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,280
war and the danger was two nuclear armed

946
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,359
states and that's why the world should

947
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,720
have been sitting up and worried and

948
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,800
paying paying attention and saying we

949
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,920
don't want this to escalate because a

950
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,079
nuclear war between between two rivals

951
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,760
is not just dangerous for the two

952
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,560
rivals, it's dangerous for the entire

953
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,359
world. The situation for Ukraine and

954
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,440
Russia, we can we saw how easily and

955
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,680
quickly that was triggered. although it

956
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,320
built up over a number of years from the

957
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,160
annexation of Crimea um you know the the

958
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,160
protests we saw in Maidan the the

959
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,400
shifting of governments in Ukraine and

960
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,400
then obviously Vladimir Putin denying

961
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,320
that he was going to actually invade

962
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,760
Ukraine proper and that's what he's done

963
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,000
and he's annexed a lot of land. Um but

964
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,240
there is

965
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,240
also moments I think of hope. Yes, I

966
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,160
think you're right. And one sort of

967
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,720
miscalculation, misunderstanding can

968
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,599
lead to escalation. And we are already

969
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,440
seeing all sorts of cold wars simmering

970
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,760
in different parts of the world which

971
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,320
can lead to, you know, all out global

972
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,560
war. You know, to think that an

973
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,680
assassination somewhere could have le

974
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,680
led to a global war. Um, anything can

975
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,160
happen and anything can then trigger an

976
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,480
allout war. Um, but I do think that

977
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,920
there I've been on this trip following

978
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,000
Donald Trump from uh Riyad, Saudi Arabia

979
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,040
to Doha and then we've been trailing his

980
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,280
trip as well to Abu Dhabi. What happened

981
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:16,720
in Riyad with um Ahmed al- Shar, the now

982
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,839
interim leader of Syria. He was a

983
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,119
hardened jihadi. He was an al-Qaeda

984
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:26,599
militant who spent time in one of the

985
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:30,960
harshest American prisons, Abu Grae, in

986
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:33,760
Iraq where, you know, there is no doubt

987
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:40,079
that he has American blood on his hands.

988
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:42,720
And yet he went back to Syria and formed

989
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,760
this rebel group that then ended up

990
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,560
toppling the Assad regime. And there is

991
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,640
even reports that the Trump uh

992
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,040
administration considered for a short

993
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,880
period of time to assassinate him

994
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,720
because he's this rebel leader who was

995
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,319
taking over these militants were taking

996
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,480
over Syria. And yet on Mon on Tuesday um

997
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,800
we saw Donald Trump say that he was

998
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,400
going to lift sanctions on Syria. On

999
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,839
Wednesday he spent 30 minutes with Ahmed

1000
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,599
al- Shar. And after that meeting, he

1001
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,079
described him as a tough guy with a

1002
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,680
tough past, an attractive guy, you know,

1003
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,119
someone that the United States was

1004
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,520
willing to uh to work with and deal

1005
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,440
with. This is geopolitics. This is the

1006
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,599
nature of the world. the Iranians that

1007
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,240
who have for the longest time have had

1008
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,640
proxies that have operated in the Middle

1009
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,400
East um that have launched direct

1010
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,440
attacks on American bases um American

1011
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,480
embassies um American infrastructure.

1012
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,240
Now America is sitting with them and and

1013
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,079
coming up with a nuclear deal. And so I

1014
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,400
did an exclusive interview with Hamas

1015
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,280
yesterday where they said, "Yes, we're

1016
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,920
in direct talks. Hamas responsible for

1017
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,960
October 7 and killing of, you

1018
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:06,160
know, Israeli hostages and Israeli

1019
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,880
citizens inside Israel, which for the

1020
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,800
United States was an unforgivable move.

1021
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,280
And we've seen what's happened in Gaza

1022
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,200
since 60,000 people have been killed as

1023
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,359
a result. And I did this interview with

1024
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,599
Hamas yesterday at the hands, by the

1025
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,000
way, of Israel. Israeli air strikes have

1026
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,000
killed these 60,000 people. But I put to

1027
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,079
the Hamas leader that you triggered this

1028
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,720
by launching October 7 and you brought

1029
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,400
this hellfire on your own people. And he

1030
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,760
said to me, we are in direct talks with

1031
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,640
the United States. So what I'm trying to

1032
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,599
say is that the nature of the world

1033
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,359
whilst it feels scary and stressful

1034
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,280
while the information we're getting on a

1035
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,200
daily basis is that things are

1036
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,200
triggering everywhere and we saw another

1037
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,400
flash point in India and Pakistan how

1038
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,560
dangerous that was there is also things

1039
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,200
happening behind the scenes where

1040
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,280
negotiations are taking place to diffuse

1041
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,599
situations and to bring people out from

1042
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,440
the cold. But this idea that never

1043
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,920
again, a holocaust will never happen

1044
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,119
again, a world war one or two will never

1045
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,280
happen again, I think is false. And I

1046
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,760
think people who understand history know

1047
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,440
that we are on the cusp of something

1048
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,560
incredibly dangerous. And it can be

1049
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,480
triggered by a miscalculation, an

1050
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,800
escalation that can lead to an all-out

1051
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,640
war. But I'm also heartened by what I'm

1052
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,119
seeing in different parts of the world

1053
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,839
in terms of negotiations and deals to

1054
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,839
try and diffuse situations.

1055
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,920
discomforting answer. Um, we're almost

1056
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,160
at the end of this podcast. What What

1057
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:45,119
are your ending notes? I think that um,

1058
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,960
India is at a a at a different point in

1059
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,440
where it is in terms of where its

1060
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,240
standing is in the global community and

1061
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,520
it is offering something very different

1062
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,920
to Pakistan. And so I I'm often

1063
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,880
encouraged. I come to India once a year

1064
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,200
and I am encouraged by what I see in

1065
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,920
India, the development, the the pace at

1066
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,440
which it's going. And like all

1067
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:13,240
democracies, it has its problems. Um but

1068
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,920
I am encouraged by the development, the

1069
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,000
technology, the entrepreneurship, the

1070
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,520
enterprising nature of India, the

1071
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,520
startups that we're seeing, the nature

1072
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,160
of the startups, the conversations that

1073
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,720
are being had in India. Um it is quite

1074
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,319
extraordinary I think um where India is

1075
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,319
today and the growing middle class. Uh

1076
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,160
just want to say thank you at the end of

1077
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,400
this conversation. I began with a thank

1078
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,280
you on behalf of my country because we

1079
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,440
