Because direction will set the condition. We Why do you need to go? What is the purpose? How else Want to go? What is our path? These three things There should be crystal clear documentation Needed We are ok. That's all. That's it. Ok. break down all these questions further Will download it during the podcast. Sure. Ok. next question. There are a lot of such businesses that fade away overtime Or they have a downfall. so the most common What is a mistake? any long term Of successful business? what happens many times that when a man gets success then we She climbs on top of his head. He thinks of me All the answers come on . and when he says that I get all the answers, then I get intoxicated with that He takes such a hazardous risk which is not driven by data and the Reality it is driven by the ego. and in that What happens is that he takes a gamble. It It is very different from a business risk. And That gambling is often driven by ego. End it ain't back by numbers and then whatever built it falls flat on the face and Off the story. Ok? Because this is a scaling The business is special. Family Business Special Is. So the question to you is, what Successful businesses are in the long term Their owners give their children three main tips What do you usually give? look at the kids One thing parents say is work hard. They always think that it is about our time, friend I used to work very hard. First is hard work do it. Second is blindly trusting someone Do not do it. Make friends wisely too. And the third thing is that friend, this is something I made Don't be lazy over it. standing on your feet show. Earn your stripes. he always They want that okay I will make it for you I have been. But I worked so hard Made. What did you do for yourself? you have What did you do differently? So their always There is advice and there is concern as well that is until he gets on his own feet If they stand up, then what I'm going to give them They won't be able to handle even that. We are ok. Just expanding this question, one I will ask practical questions. a business It is said in the circles that Ambani He is the third generation of the family and is very capable This is an age compared to other business families. it Why is it being said? See, that is why it is said It is happening because the results are coming. if you Look at this, divide the business so intelligently to be done. it's not easy to divide Reliance empire but its DNA of the Divide the child according to their DNA to be done. Governance mechanisms were put in place. and the potential of the business and potential Off to the next jan was matched. that is Forest. The second thing is the scale of Reliance I am sitting on it you know I use the term escape velocity that is almost escape velocity Is. people process system governance it's a Well oiled machine. So if the children are not capable Even if it were there it would be very difficult to destroy to do. But kids are capable. Our I have seen grandfather. saw your father Is. I have seen him working hard. so what would have happened Is? When you watch kids learn from you, We don't learn by speaking. So that DNA, that Hard work, that self-sacrifice comes into it. That's the reason everybody is very sure that This generation is going to do well. We are ok. No sir during this entire podcast I am a First generation entrepreneur I will also talk to Perspective. Absolutely. And People who are going to inherit the business From your parents and also from their perspective I will ask questions as we move forward. Ok. A The next question is asked in India that most There is more money in boring businesses. Which is not glamorous. Why? Look boring What is business? For the children of today. Its name is manufacturing. Manufacturing means in a factory to go, to the shop floor, to have a fight with the labour doing, looking after the machines, quality Look And it is repetitive. But if we View MSMEs There are total MSMEs you know almost 60% of them are in the Manufacturing sector. so that's why it said It seems that the dude is boring. But if we Think carefully, which country? Grew up without manufacturing? We Who has become big on the strength of trading? So manufacturing is needed but there is fun in it It does not come because there is repetition in it. so this The saying is true. but the next generation So I want to say this brother, it is like this. Have patience. It is feeding your bills. It is feeding you know all yours which is good for you right now If you are living a lifestyle then go with it Learn. Behind glamorous things all the time There is no need to run away. Yes sir. My I also have my own business. it's a talent Management company. is a media agency. Very Monk is considered a glamorous company Entertainment. Ok? but we have built it Over Seven Years. and we've seen the wear and tear, I have seen struggles and challenges. and at this Point being, young business professionals are I have found out that at some point there is no such person Business should be started where repeatability is important Factor it in the product. where you can Design a Product Once and Keep It Growing For ever. You have said this very well. because if we're doing customized things not as many times as in manufacturing Is? Your dis became yours if it is a mass produced manufacturing than you are Absolutely right, you worked hard, then you Can reap the benefits for some point of time The business you mentioned brother is digging a well every day and drink water everyday and come to a well the next day should be excavated more thoroughly because A lot of people have come. so you absolutely Right. ah you know sir i think the audience also by now it has been understood that the businesses which Only those businesses which are profitable are cool businesses. Today's That face of the world has gone where the coolness of business To be or not to be depends on their raise capital Was dependent. at this point people Appreciate Businesses That Make Money. And me I believe that in modern day India 99% of the profitable businesses are Repeatability based. It's absolutely fine. One Something you can repeat every day Every year and then learn to scale it. yes Absolutely. Fair to perfectly fine. I will give him coaching today. Ok. Moving on. Name of the most iconic group of our country It is Tata Group. for 160 years Have been profitable. they grew there overall Group of Businesses. So his three businesses I would like to know the secrets. Ok. I think Great question. The first thing is that Tata that the whole family has been right from Founder Till Ratan Tata never owned There was no feeling at all. Custodianship Brother, I am the custodian of the next generation. I am not the master of what I want to enjoy Have to do it. First. Second Thing Joe Society It's a give back thing. Now we are the people No CSR has come, give me 2%. there was no rule at that time It was not there. but you know the way back 70 years back you no there was a crush in the factory for women we you know there were benefits that did not exist in corporate India which is Tata used to give so concern for society give back to Society and take care of your employees The three building blocks that remained came butt Will add a fourth one wherever the business goes Zero compromise with value system I can tell you from my friends who work V Tata, many times he says friend speed money you understand what is speed money they call it yes brother its no big deal we will do it slow I will not give you money so you have to be able to stand The ground is fine friend, there will be loss of business Never mind, I will stay Value Systems So of these three, you said three and I said the fourth one too I added I think that is very rare and If these value systems were maintained you know i think this company is there for Eternity and this lesson everyone should learn Patience and Thank You Patience and Thank You Nice or OK Another Hypothetical Practical Question According to you our country's superstar What does Shahrukh Khan tell his son Aryan will say about business because said It is said that Shahrukh Khan is the most popular actor in Bollywood He is the best businessman. Absolutely. aryan khan What will you call it? You will tell them this, son Have you seen me? What time do I sleep? I get up at what time and I What condition have you become in? he is exactly of My Age. Ok? he has to first tell son One doesn't become Shahrukh just like that. To become Shahrukh Working 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 hours for Does matter. And with so much wealth and fame Even after I'm Not Singing on My Laurels. Now I have become one. So first of all he will teach you what I asked you at the beginning Hard work is non-negotiable. The second Shahrukh A very important thing is that everyone take along with you respect he knows how to Respect people wether it is a fan wether it is an extended family and friends only Nos How to Respect People. i think that Is the second tip he is going to give him. and thirdly he will tell I am sure to Aryan that son look at your father and grandfather Where have we come from and all this Even after it happened, it did not come to my mind I am still grounded, my son is grounded stay in the air don't float because in the air If you swim then your path will be somewhere above Nor does it let you fall anywhere. i think these are the Three things I'm sure he would be telling me Aryan Hum from Personal Finance Perspective what will you say? From personal finance, this is they will say that look friend it is like this if there was one This is personal wealth. Ok? insulate it Take it from business. We are making sure that the business grows It may continue going down. So whichever one of yours You have become accustomed to the lifestyle. So May it continue for you. so I'm sure he will Create those iron walls which anyone is smart Business family dude this is my personal For well being, you know we are your bread and butter Understand those cars that end lifestyle separate that from the business i think that would be his great advice because business Despite being a good leader, anything can Happens. Business means risk. it can be because of you it can be insight of your Best efforts. i think that's what he Will definitely tell him. because shahrukh is Also Come from Ambal Beginning and Jo Ambal There is a beginning somewhere or the other leaves an imprint of insecurity and It lasts for two-three generations. so i am Surely this thing will be secure, boss Do it and go. Akshay Kumar sir came on the show. I also asked him whether There is a middle class boy inside you right now Too. He said yes absolutely. He Said That. Because of that, hard work is being done. Absolutely Correct. So it's a super power almost came. Yes. So here we have talked about Tatas, Ambanis I have talked about it, I have talked about Shahrukh Khan. I want to ask you a little googly question, Those who are the top of the top people in India What is their personal finance strategy often? it occurs? See what they do? To all This is their important strategy. Don't put your eggs in one basket. We are the first The thing is this diversified portfolio. Second Don't Trust One Wealth Manager. Have multiple wealth managers. third take a mix of people you know who are managing Your Wealth. take a mix of people you don't No Pure Professional. i think anyone A smart guy works with these three things. Hum because this is the only way to diversify And mitigate your risk. We don't know all the eggs So, you have to put an asset with a person Do you want to put him in class? This is my friend This has to be given to him. A friend as well as a professional is also there. I think this is what they follow and No wonder they do well. I mean if you see me last Three Four Years and That's What If You See Any studies I mean the wealth of the richest People in the country in three years would have More than doubled may be B may be 2.5x. We Or is this what the middle class of our country has to learn? To. absolutely how to get there arrived and after reaching there further how to go? to further that questions and are considered that the richest people in our country His maximum money is in real estate specifically land it's true this is absolutely correct Is. okay because look what that land's Our faith is firm in us that brother land, land, property, gold, so land comes first It comes. but again it depends on whom you You are talking about net worth. if you are talking somebody with multimillionaire crore you know sort of asset base than he would have been 25 30% In The Land's End Among Others. you get My point? But whose net worth is slightly less. may be the proportion of land may be higher in That. because it entered the human mind It has happened. Why is it in the ground? This big It is important. Firstly by selling the land Can't eat it. I spent my money today so you R. Force. It's a force locking. Second Everybody knows that God has stopped making Land. It will increase further. Wow! So brother, plant it in the ground, better late than never But it is a good investment so but as I said once you reach a very High level because then you also get wealth advisors who will explain you that sir land Apart from this there are other asset classes also. Butt Up To A Certain Networth I'm Saying about 50% and may be closer to 50% would be In Land. We are a I hope the audience understands how much value it has You are getting this short power from MBA yes. And just 10 minutes have passed off Recording. Still, I am saying this. Sir The question is that in those business families There are only daughters in today's era 2025 In. There is a family patriarchal mentality It is different. What is happening? Reality What is there in India? The look is totally different. If you have a son and a daughter, compare them If they do it then it is very clear. daughter's wedding I invested all my business in my son Will go. This still happens today. it is the same today Is. That's why I always say that you I thought that whatever my friend gives to my daughter in marriage I gave what I had to give. He came back after 5 years Went. The law says it is 50%. So the fight If you are getting it installed then please clarify. But Your question is different. If there are two daughters There are two ways in which business owners win I talk to him. one says brother It is like that. Both are daughters. A daughter I am interested in business but not one. But both get equal share of the business Give. The second one is a musician. Second Wali is a teacher. the second one is doing Research in America. Equal shares for both will get. Now comes the time to talk. Some? People say that I involve my son in law I will take it. I have no problem. Butt enough business family especially of our community She says brother son in law does his work Will do it. The daughter will do her own thing. Governance I will install the mechanism. No to these losses I will let you enter into the business. It is very clear. So his view is very clear that if if there are daughters, they will be given shares and they Run a business, whether one or two Run it and both daughters will get equal share. Our ethical and legal angle is that There should be an exact correct division. whether boy girl if there are two boys and one girl So 1/3 is 1/3 . we are one boy one girl If it is then it is 50-50. and if you don't do that Look, I am saying that the law says something. But some norms remain in our culture In. There is one thing in culture that now a friend lives in a house For example, my father has a whole house Is. There is a whole building. now it's commercial Went. My parents are living with me now. No. So where will the daughter come from? give it to him I gave it. So it will be in my name only. I am giving an example of a house. This way He's son is taking care of the business, isn't he? So the marriage took place. But I am saying this law Ever since the change has happened and I am doing every business Because of family, this course is also different Consulting is the first thing I ask you Yes brother, did you think of this or not? No Didn't think about it. Why didn't you think Brother? Think, Discuss, Document and Tell me this is the plan. not to daughter I will give it or I will not give 50%. I will give you 25% Because the son is driving. it has to be Fair and Equitable. Look, there is a word called equal and equitable. There is no talk of equal. it has to B. Equitable. Means it has to be fair. It has to be based on some formula and some Method. It can't be arbitrary. It is very Clarity is necessary in the case of girls Should be. If children, if by chance your It is like this in the mind, in the subconscious mind that If you do not give 50% to your daughter then it should be clear Why should I not give it? I wonder that such What are the girls thinking? I'm Dead sure that according to them it's a no brainer that i am 50% It's a no-brainer. Today's generation JX You talk to Jane and they know the law and you know i have you know i like in my house Daughters We Can't Even Talk About Equality meaning you are saying why are you saying that means is there something in your mind that it is not equal do you get the drift why is this question even that is equal of course it is equal so I am sure so this is a very nice thing ranveer ki Parents are probably thinking, oh no brainer It belongs to the son and what is the daughter thinking Brainer is 50% mine how big is the rift and you are sowing the seeds of what chaos will happen This happens in every business family Sorting this out and fixing it is a lot of work It is important what happens in America and Europe it's exactly like this is no difference is no difference the inheritance is same for the children but it's driven by a will its Driven by If There Is No Will So For Example: I can choose to know if you give me an ex and that percentage but this discrimination Against the female children is far more rampant in india as compared to the western countries hum This will change, the next business will definitely change Look at the owner I'm talking to now What is happening Ranveer, this is also a reality check Sad Reality But Lots of Separations from Kant Divorces are happening a lot So what does the business owner think that my friend It may not happen in lifetime Because divorces are still happening even after 20 years It's still happening even after 15 years. one is this and the other They say this is my daughter in many cases They are not working financially for every father There is a wish. I also wish that friend, my daughters are financially Be independent. If in a family he she is staying not because her She is earning her livelihood by choice. of love I am living for it. living for family Are. so that's why to answer your question Increasingly I am seeing the fathers also I am not thinking, friend. Like it was zero before If you don't get married then 100% I will take care of my son Not Say the Mindset Has Become 50-50 But In there mind it is that the son has a little I should get more or I am driving but There should be something bigger in the daughter's name There is at least one positive change in India the needle has moved okay next question especially if If we talk about us, there are many such businesses There are families who have been doing this for five to six generations We are growing our businesses. Absolutely. Wool What is common among all families? So Look what people have done in it. Either stay together or separate. don't interrupt Hang on. So, let me give you an example. The brothers are getting along well. It's love. You will sacrifice your life and stay with me. having a fight Is. Father will say, son, go away. means every It is different with every generation. so if you see the same brand name of mine This brand is also owned by grandfather's brother's sons Is. My grandfather's faction also belonged to that This is the brand. so they may not have changed the Brand name. but they have divided the business Over such a period of time. We think he is There is a family. but there are various factions of the family because they understood they had the If you stay with the vision, utensils will ring. So Brother, separate them out. no fight No it is not so. Option One Option Two in Rare Cases. so suppose there are four facets of the Family. So maybe there won't be four parts. Two people who are in love are together and The two factions are different. so the trick is this visualize that you can live together No? I can't stay. Divide it. Separate Get it done. Otherwise, drive with love. what is a problem? will stay with me with love Children. This is your thinking and you are thirsty for blood It has happened. that is the problem but lots of The Kolkata Businessman You Know marwar the shekhawati region and gents you know who Gone from there, they have this intelligence that's not my friend it's foresight that's where they are Survived Across Generations Futuristic Futuristic is the potential problem see, understand, do not deny, look What happens is that a man lies the most He tells himself lies I don't say anything, they know it won't work brother We have to run our brothers' business separately do it friend hum hum Now, I also want to say something But I have a question for you regarding the next question. I will ask you so many business families If you have studied then you belong to Marwari business family and What is the difference in a Gujarati business family? yes ok people look alike from a distance Are from. This is commonality in accounting He is topper in Mathematics. We Are financially prudent. Lifestyle It is exactly like beans. Looks like a bean. But there are big differences. so i will say That Marwari businessmen are more methodical. As is the system. That was taken out by Birlaz Is. It means brother when he goes home in the evening Tell me what came in. Auntie is in My. Ok? so they are much more methodical, Much more systematic. Gujaratis on the other Hands are I think more liberal more acceptable. The second difference is Marwaris are very very Traditional, Very Hierarchical Gujarati Eye Find a slightly more liberal one and I think this is my guess because when i see almost every gujarati family has somebody in Atlanta and That Region of America. so there is there a lot of westernization Were s Marwari people it is not like that The kids are not out but they have a lot of business It is limited to India only. so this is these are sum of the differences gujarati i find more Liberals Have a More Broad Minded Risk Appetite It is in both. and methodical I think Yes, there are a few more Marwari people. Hmm Hmm. A is a super power which I have learnt in Gujarat Notice has been made in business families and Notice in honestly every Gujarati household I have done it. My mother is also Gujarati. I slept Seen it up close. Ok. the super power is Gujarati women are fantastic at running Families are as well as running businesses. and this I have always noticed that even if there are Not actively taking part in the business. They guide their husbands in detail Are. If the marriage is lasting. that's the Another angle. but i think at least in my eyes When it comes to Gujarati business families The female head who is the matriarch of the family they always have a role to play a little bit in I have noticed this business. I don't know about this is amazing thing and there for my hypothesis this is just from Observations that Gujaratis I find more liberal more broad minded may be it is coming from there that women have a role to Play and I personally think it's a good thing because you see this they say lonely at the Top To whom can a business owner go to narrate his complaint? Cried? Whom should I tell my pain to? To the Employee He will manipulate it. so if your life partner is someone with whom you can share your Pen and She Can Add Value in Giving Your Perspective like you talked about your mother. and i think may be this is one of the Secrets of Being a Gujarati Business Woman So successful. Hmm. A honestly sir right now my business career is Almost 10 years have passed. a if i want to get romantically involved with Anyway this is one of my conditions. i should Be able to talk work with the person. Very This is necessary. ok amazing. Either and I genuinely feel that Women around the world have a very strong strategy Makes it. The Great Strategies. I slept Also agree with that. So So The Culture Which I Come From Not From My Family Side But from my the corporation i work for office That nothing will happen at home. Ok? But Recently when this covid came work from home So obviously I told you a few things She gives it to me. You know but I agree with you. I think there is a sense of people It is very sharp. and sometimes there is no Logic it's just pure intuition. If He said that the guy is not well You will get to know about it somewhere after 5-7 years. Let's go or after 20 years that he was not right. So I agree with the one is intuition and I also think the way they look at things and the Those guys look at things that are very, very scary Different. Our parameters are different. So I think it's a good strategy that you are having that both may be you bring them both Bring complementary things to the table. And it's wonderful. Hmm. Do You Think Great Marriages Can Lead To Great businesses? I think so. but but Ranveer, I always say this in my life If you want to bring a partner into the business then This is walking on the razor’s edge. Ok. Failure The chances are high. We are my own There is a view. I have a lot of data. if you say it I will tell you as well. If there is success then it will be super It will be successful. But it's walking on the razors Edge. Don't ever think that we have so much If there is love and understanding then in business It will work. Chances of conflict are high. But If You Can Crack the Code and Set Some Protocols I think it can be a great Combination. we know you let's take The case of biotech. Is it okay? let's take the Piramal Family. you know nandini piramal and Peter. you know so there are so many cases that In which husband wife combination have really Work but it is a bit difficult according to me I think so flatization flatization is necessary First you must understand what I am saying I'm putting a big disclaimer like this There is no disclaimer which I haven't read This is a little bit bold and high that should husband and wife work together This is my view, if there is synergy then let us give it can work but assume that Conflict zones will come which can even Destroy your personal relationship. so if you Call it out at the beginning and tell me friend will come and for that you have already become proactive If you take action then the chances are mitigated. But on which assumption are you working yes? Like I said earlier, kids Love will remain. our love will be forever. No. So then it can work. Ok. next question It is interesting. Are spoiled kids too Businesses can grow. of the spoilt The definition depends on this. if you You can come to the office, board meeting You can attend without giving it away then You can drive it. or i'm saying that if you're spoiled and As I looked at that spoilt thing, He said it is an iron wall. Brother whatever i do In my personal time I drive Tanu's car I drive, I do this, I do that. But if I show up in a board meeting and I Sleep off. and if i'm distracted or Topic A is happening, B is happening. like this also I have seen the cases. than better to stay Professionalize the business. does that Answer the question? Or another question. Under What conditions should you stay out of business? If you are not interested, you feel suffocated it is, you don't feel like it and there is something else in you You have the fire to do it, don't get into business at all. Professionalize it. System, process There are plenty of good templates available. and enough and more examples are that only blood I can't drive it. Someone else can also drive it. Don't come at all. You will live a life of suffocation and mortification. You are ruining your business as well. You are not doing any favor to anybody. Ok. So that more Indians know the truth about India. So I would ask you this question: What is the problem in Delhi? What is the difference between the rich and the rich of Mumbai It happens? This is a touchy question. So the rich in Delhi are not that rich Will be loud. There will be some carts, some There will be some show off, show off to the girls, To impress, Bombay's Rise is a little sale Will be. They will also have a long car. but the Music will not be blaring with the you know Mirrors down. If they go to a high end Restaurants, they won't be bosses. and i have seen in mumbai you no like there are some places you would also know where Leave the table, you don't get a seat during the weekend they look this section is reserved for me that's They have to show off but they will not make a ruckus Gulla so the rich of Delhi will exploit and Let's see brother, did I see this or not I shouted that I came in such a big car Bombay wala is self contained in himself you no theek hai and he will not be so loud and he is not you know peeping that someone saw Or no, it's my car, so that's the difference. It's a big cultural difference between Delhi And Mumbai. But no business oriented Are there differences? There is a lot of difference. Very There is a difference. I think Bombay is There is more truth in it. I am sorry. Delhi Height Working in Delhi. Truth in Bombay Is too much. Bombay has a simple and straightforward language. Seth, this won't be possible. A little in Delhi Over promise and under delivery. Bombay I Will Not Say Under Promise and Over It is delivered. What is delivered is what is promised It appears to be the same. so i think its ethical much easier to do business in bombay because What you see is what you get. so i think It's a very big difference. Sir another India This is a centric question. And I did not start this discussion Heard it in Mumbai. Often. a discussion this that's it man it feels like tie to cities There is high money potential in it. and very Everybody says there is a lot of money It is in tier two because spending Tie to Tie Three becomes slightly less. is is this true? that earning potential has higher In the Interiors of India. So look at this Do you know what the answer is? that of the man who experience hai na it is based on Expectation versus reality. now tier two you expect so little from there Even a little bit starts making bigger noises Let's go. You get my point? Butt Carts Where are they sold the most? tie to or tie In the forest? Where do luxury cars sell the most? Are? If 200 units are sold in Delhi, a of car and if 20 are sold in Indore then We'll see 20 more of those. Because I I am expecting 10 from there. so that is one thing tier one still has more money but Yes the wealth is percolating down. so five Years 10 Years Back If You See The One You Know Luxury Car Network and Dealership Consumers Durable Network and Luxury Brands Network It Wasn't There So Much. so fancy Showrooms were not in Tier 2 and Tier 3. Today They are becoming viable. but to se ki tie to me More potential of growth naturally because the denominator is less. If we are a The lower the denominator of the thing the lower the saturation If it happens then the potential is high. But Age Of today tie one is definitely larger and a Bigger market than tier two and tier three. Ok Sir. One last question from Electricity MBA. Question that a lot of judges get multi million Dollar careers needed. Butt a little A reality check is also needed. a please shed Light on the time required and please tell What things need to be sacrificed In the pursuit of making multi-millions Dollar Businesses. so only one is mine This is the advice to JG because I also say in some of the startup contests that they It seems that this is how things happen because The media is probably not trying to tell you them this so one i want to tell them hard work number one has to be done, number two will be a failure number three will have to be pivoted many times Your so called world changing idea it may be that it changes four times and some And it becomes number four, whatever you say I am saying that there is quick money, become a billionaire quickly You will go, he is misleading you. there can B C An exception cannot be the rule One gets a salary of Rs 1 crore in IIT. again Statistics are fooling us. so i want To tell them you will have to be patient, even if you lose It will happen, blood will come out, injury will happen, hurt There will be challenges, your self concept will also be challenged. That's part of the journey. us and that's what i see you know whatever genji i interact with three or four failures Neither do they become big and they tell anyone I am unable to even express my pain. you know i can See that they are feeling lost inside. give and take Not feeling confident. wherever i went Up. He became a multi-millionaire. How many buns Are you gone brother? We should have patience. no hurry up work Not there. And remove the fear from your mind and heart Remove the judgement. be absolutely shameless what's the hurry what's the hurry Dear, we must become 30 multi You have to make a million in 30 years, you can make it in 40 years Hum you know I mean there is so much pressure Unnecessary has been created and Ranveer I think through your this forum I want to say That I used to think that in our generation There is a big competition but I think Judge's There is pressure and it's not merely because of Instagram pictures you know that's one piece but it's also about and it's not about jealousy it's about what did i do wrong that other person did right so I want to tell Let them do what you said, don't be judgemental Everyone's journey is different, everyone's path is different It is different, apply all the factors friend, only then Like to like apple to apple only then compare hoga na may be you are not building in all the Factors and Just Destroying Yourself self concept self respect self Confidence is not like that, we know this Have you heard about short attention spans? Everyone is done with the reels of shots Because of. i think it applies havely on jsg Careers also. Ah this is the skill difference Foresight in Your Generation Among Millennials It used to be like, okay let me visualize what 20 Years from now will look like what 40 Years from now will look like this. A That combined with all this fear of judgment. Ahhh Getting over well by the pressures around you. Or Some strength is needed. a which is there in a fussiness but it needs to be there On a larger scale. Anyways sir now electricity MBA finished. a we will start the sukoon Oriented business podcast. Details We will move forward with the templates So that people can start their life with a notebook and pen Change. Through this episode. Let's begin. perfect. Ok. actually practical Beginning of chapters. a again this has to be The Most Value Adding Podcast of the Year. Sir. So in chapter one we'll talk about Personalized Personal Finance Strategies about. These are two perspectives. First Perspective for Someone Completely Self Med. A person whose family doesn't have money, What should be done? Second Perspective Joe people are inheriting a little bit of their From the family. Explain this also. Look at what exactly There is no family backing. And I Assume I am talking about your business family Are you staying with someone or working? in the first case or job of a job holder of that one. So what I am saying is that the most Firstly, the job holder has to see to it that If even before AI comes in today’s time Such a time will surely come when six to eight months or year if both of you are working if you are Married you know one person will not have a job and such It is also possible that it may not be for two. so start Saving for the Rainy Day. thats point number Forest. Point number two is that we have a It has become a tradition. There must be a home. Home Buy it quickly. so the people who have been Be successful in their jobs you know one There is a resolution that the house should be ready for retirement I will make it later. Throw me to Kolkata Throw it to Aurangabad and I will go. so build a house That you should not hurry so much. If you have to make yes you should be flexible to live in a Rented Accommodation. The third thing is that Diversify Your Portfolio. if somebody is Telling You Take a Portfolio PMS But use mutual fund, use PMS Various Things to Keep on Growing Your You no portfolio and the most important thing is this Have a target in mind and get it somewhere Document it because it is a moving goal post that dude this is my net worth If this happens then I will feel secure in Life hum hmm. it is a continual Moving goal posts. How Ever Build Inflation Into it. Because what happens when Ranveer He keeps moving, so you keep yourself moving Then you are harsh on yourself. because dude My net worth is this much, his is this much. So these are the things i think very well for Personal Finance Point of View. We are ok. I would like to add a couple of points. the point I don't want to add what you already added Is PMS firms. Nobody tells us this that a portfolio management service is called There is one thing. Everybody thinks so, friend How do I do personal finance? I Don't even know it. my suggestion is pms Find firms and work with them and targets Working with them early. The different PMS Lower thresholds vary across firms There are. That is, how much money is the minimum Have to invest. So find a good one Which you can fit into. and this data is Easily available. It's published data. We are you Can these be PMS providers? What is the last three years Cager? Five What is Ears Cagger? 10 years, seven years What are the kinds of risk capital you know What type of portfolio do they do? So PMS is very important. Butt PMS Requires a Certain Minimum Capital You Know it's 50 lax before you can get into one PMS. I think something like new age PMS Firms where threshold is Rs 10 lakh Is. Fine. So I am not aware of that. But if you have it I'm saying this if you have it There is a good PMS, that's a very good way to really increase your wealth because of the way The Market Has Been in the Last Few Years and is likely to be in the fourth coming Time you know apart from your salaried income If you do it right then this can really Be a good wealth creation engine for you because it is important for the one who did not inherit Isn't it true that we are talking about insecurity? That fear is always there, so make a target And achieve it. It took 5 years, it took 10 years. But consciously you have to make it happen. We we second point i would like to add is yaar Live within your means. Especially in your 20s, the Instagram affair I do not spend money on YouTube More than you need to spend. infact Savings are cool and it will make your life Much cool on your 30s. So live a little under Your meals. so i am very simple about it That you know it's a crude way of saying it. You On whose strength are you dancing? You are spending, Mummy and Daddy are giving it and it is limitless do it. Brother you are wasting your own money and If you are not saving then why are you Shooting Yourself in the Foot. and you don't Have a security net. means that you to another Bleak your own future to show had been. So security net is variant. hmm so as you would no lot of people go and Work in Africa, some people go to the Middle East But now you know in the Middle East the cost of Living has gone up so I see a lot of my friends they go to you know they have a The Hardship They Go Without to Create a Family that safety net we're talking about that If I am not inheriting then brother safety net do what you have to do for it is very important We have a final point I would like to add is one There is another thing which I think to some degree You are taught this in school. Butt often I have observed that finance strategy The YouTube channels do not teach that Also focus on attacking game. That means the income Focus a little on increasing it. now weather you Are you doing it in one job and through multiple There should be some aggression in income sources Needed You should think about your own career How do I multiply this? do i get Promoted to the next degree. how do i Get promoted in that case? so i am fully agree with sea today what has happened is That's there two types of jobs. Some Jobs There are some things which can extract you so much. They take it. At least the kind of companies are Work for Even to Go and Give a Guest Lecture wasn't possible. but i think now Companies are realizing this work life Balance piece. so if we have a passion we end you can slowly go without conflict Interest with your company. we are not moon Lighting. I started my company in 45 hours But it was weak. after that whatever time I have Bacha I fully agree with you that out of that also you should you should be aggressive too INCREASE YOUR TOP LINE We ​​want that and that When will the target be achieved? I have to achieve it bhaiya and for this I will do everything put in the Extra House Exactly Exactly That Do you want or need this whole YouTube career? I am self made, I did not take money from anyone Parents also did not provide funds for age 22 to 24 Tak a I worked as a trainer and specially On weekends. When the weekends were free I He used to fill all the slots. and i would earn that extra money but it gave me a Cushion for my YouTube channel. so that at least Between 22 and 27-28 that aggression will happen I need a little. so you know this is very good You stated the point. one of me Took an interview a few days ago. Asked Dude work life balance. I said I did I never thought about it. If you work life Balance you are thinking that I will stay longer than this If I don't give it then change your job. That means that you I am not in the right job. second thing if you I am not getting juice in my job, I am not getting juice it is, juice is the right word you know which is ours If I am not getting Rasa then Bhaiya I have a day job then do something else on the weekend but this It is absolutely correct that you should increase your income It is very important when I was growing up. don't know if it is right or wrong so they What is the difference between Told me Bunny and Punjabi Punjabis believe that God has increased my expenses If you increase your expenses then you will automatically generate income I will run but I don't know if it is true or not But I 100% agree with this, do it a little Friend, bring passion and do it, you know we swing the bat really hard wali r young yes Absolutely okay right now I think we've wrapped Up the Topic About Personal Finance for Someone Who is self-made? Those who inherit money are inheriting the property I would like to bracket these separately. In the layers of A capital, suppose that someone has a capital of Rs 1 lakh. Someone has One person has a capital of Rs 10 lakh. Any has a capital of Rs 1 crore. Someone has There is a capital of Rs 10 crore. Now tell me Sir Four Categories: How is the game of personal finance now? should I play? so when we say this inherited it i.e. my father He gave me the cheque. That would never happen because he is giving you a gift or he Giving you money for investment Are. Both things are different. you get my Point? this inheritance is a seed money for you to make a business and This is seed money to grow the wealth. if it is Seed Money to Grow the Wealth. That means a gift Did. I gave my child ₹1 on his birthday Gave Rs 10 crore. in most cases Only the parents will decide. but if it is As a seed money for your business for your passionate idea so I will say this to him taking capital and doing what you want Make a three year business plan. so i I am saying that Whatever I learnt in business, I also learnt it in Reliance And many other brothers are from Gujarati community There are 300 days in a year. Ok? They It is said that 1000 days are also calculated as 365 days. Invest ₹1 in this for 1000 days I will not take it out 1000, if you have to deposit ₹1 in one day then it will be closed are you getting the drift so I have ₹1 There are lakhs. I made a business plan and I have ₹1 crore and I have a business plan Made. The principal is same in both. This I won't ask for ₹1 extra within the range From mom and dad. In this the business I will drive it. From this, for your household expenses I will not take out anything. with in 1000 days it Should generate cash it should be cash positive. We If After 1000 Days I Still Need to If I I'm in a negative cash flow and this is to me If you want more money, close the business. We It's a very simple funda. This is not 1 lakh today Is. Papa, give me 10,000 more. Give me 20,000 more Give. There is no such business because we you should know that i have got capital I have to walk in that only. Basically 3 years This is the timeline of. Ok? and that initial by doing something with the capital initially Maybe by spending 10,000 maybe 1 lakh If you have Rs 1 crore by spending. Basically a percentage of that income. Maybe Between 1 to 10% Play with it and try Figuring out how to make it profitable Make it. gives a practical example Am. A lot of people are very upset that Let's open a restaurant. Are we okay? We So I ask brother in the restaurant How much money will it cost? let's say i'm taking Some Arbitrary Number Interior Vitreous All Invested crores of rupees. how much is the rent? ₹5 Lakh per month. Ok. I am so much my friend It is nearby, I will do it. So, the one who earns ₹5 lakh per month Rent is Rs. 50,000 plus up to ₹ 50,000 lakh There are overheads. Plus whatever sale you will get Will there be no cash losses initially? We What is your expenditure and what is your income will it reach the break even point from First Month Know It Might Take Six Months 8 Months to reach break even who will fund that Apart from Money Hundred Crore, it can be your ₹ Negative cash flow of Rs. lakh per month is over it's you budget it for six months then you need ₹ crore and 18 lakhs waiting out there This is the math which many youngsters don't Understand now that by pausing slightly Jugaad thinking that okay for me is food business I have to get in. and my definition of getting I want to open this food business or a restaurant. Start a Cloud Kitchen Business Instead do it. Absolutely. If instead of that you really need to grind If you want to do it then start street food business do it. Go sell your food on the street. master The Art of Food. Or once you had food Once you have completed your Masters, you can run a restaurant. Exactly. and my point in this was Which is yours worth Rs 1 lakh, 10 lakh, one crore There was an example. it's again link to that Personal Finance vs Business Finance. This is the basic funda of business finance. Yours What is the capital expenditure? Capex How much is it? How much is the OPEX? Monthly Expenses How much is it? What is the break even point? And to reach that break even point How much total fund do I need? So upfront Investment Plus the Negative Cash Flows Till you reach break even point is the money that You should have. We should have this funda. No Then after a few days you will take the bowl again You will come to your father after getting scolded and this No, what you are saying is very common. Overspending the Capital Etcetera But why does this overspending happen? Overspending on an actual human level Why does it happen? Look, you have two things. The forecasting was wrong because and it of course happens because you have never worked hard with it Bosses, the type of bosses we worked with Did you give the forecast? If you gave it then Firstly 20 questions will be asked. what is the basis Is? What is an Assumption Sheet? What is a term sheet? What have you assumed interest rate? what have you assumed about you know Inflation rate? so there is an assumption sheet Based on which you make a forecast and then This will happen to you. Not like this one day I I did it while sitting. so this is one The reason why it's going wrong is one thing that's wrong Forecast. it is not necessary Overspending. it is you have to forecast I don't know it because I haven't learnt it from anyone has taught so first of all we I will teach forecasting. without him anything Cannot be done. the second point is if you You are going over budget, how are you going brother? Was there no month wise budget? who is authorized You too go over the budget. hum if you are going Over the budget. this there has to be a Justification. Like I was handling x amount of late to Rs 850 crore from advertising and sales Promotion Budget in a Year If I Divide it Month Wise I have broken it, if mine this month I have 20 crores and I am doing 22, so I I will have to tell my boss sir 2 crores That's why I'm spending extra and this is me This is how I will recover. Are you getting the point? This is the sense that's why I am just jumping Getting into business is fine but understanding this Very Basic Principles of Cash Management Management is very important. We are overspending How did it happen brother? There was no budget system. We Why a system of plan vs actual Wasn't it? So why start a business? which is why i think its very important that At the beginning of a business person's career Working together is essential. Absolutely. Learn Understand how organizations are run. And if business is from a family then from childhood You must have learnt it. But it can also be like this That your parents are not in business. they have Been in the job and you're starting out but The Fundamental Building Blocks What I Mentioned few things break even point cash Flow management is very important. otherwise What will happen? What is its consequence? again we go back To the Psychological Thing We Worry About We should not lose our self confidence because when you go back to ask for money neither does it make you feel ashamed Nor does it destroy the man. J It happens a lot in me. very emotional He is sensitive. A little scolding in our time It would get a scratch. We sand it. Now You can't say anything. I think parents are here The role needs to be a bit hand holding Needed Absolutely. mild to very important Is. This is the specialty of India, that here Parents get a little involved in career In. At least for guidance early teaching etc. A ok. So I asked you 1 lakh and 10 la vs 1 crore vs 10 crore. The principal is the same. Yes sir. Principal Beans Is. Ok. Ok. For now you have to do this I will ask questions associated with chapter A that Suppose your parents didn't give you seed capital has given it. Directly into your bank account They put in the money and gave us independence Son, do anything. Yes. Ok. 1 lakh and 10 Lakh versus 1 crore and 10 crore. so if i I have only 1 lakh I will go and put it in the Best mutual funds. We are very simple. We I will not look left or right here and there. Yes if i have 10 la i will divide it between Mutual funds may be some other asset class it could be gold or something else but I will do that if i have 1 crore right after 10 lax is 1 crore then i will take a pms I will take a mutual fund you know I might take some little bit of gold and I might also you know invest little bit in a Property which is under construction which i know comes from a sound you know builder house i don't want to loose my shirt ok and i would do that as well so that you no i make some you no appreciation for me If I get it then I will give him three or four assets I will put you in class, I will not cry hey The stock market has fallen brother, the shares will fall Gold will rise It is the reverse, we have war, gold is up We reached the spot, so the stock fell down so hedging aren't they like us who you know It's you have to hedge at your own risk. That's what I will do. I will divide it into multiple asset classes which i am Comfortable with it but one thing is very clear. I will talk to three experts and use My own intelligence. Blind trust on someone I will not do it. and i'm assuming that 10 1 Crore Strategy for Crore Bracket into 10. That is absolutely correct. 1 Crore Strategy into 10. Ok. Ok. Moving On to the next chapter. Now we will talk about 2025 About the relevant industries of India Where there is high potential growth. then respect You have seed capital to start your business here What do you definitely want to do in your life? Industries should target us again And this means that your family business is now is it not us that you have to decide if my family business is it ok or not so i will answer first if its a family business so first of all i would check that What are the things that make me I will be disrupted. This is definitely a disruptor Will be done. i.e. self awareness related to the weaknesses to the weaknesses and the rate of change of technology we let you know say let's say today yesterday i somebody had come Home and they are into they are big travel Agents. I said friend in today's time There is also a travel agent. It is said bro There is medical tourism. he doesn't trust I can do it online. so you get my Point. I am saying that my business in that I would see that the AI, Technology, Digitization and New Trends How It Will Disrupt My Business and i will invest that money to hedge my Risk. We are you getting the points? If I have a jewelry store or we are bhaiya Our designs are such that people stand in line to get them I don't want to do it online sir If you don't want to do it today you will have to do it tomorrow people will come We are no more Blinkit at all finished after i see it on the table has happened in my house when the sauce ran out The pakoras were served and the sauce was ready in no time I am gone but here so this is one now suppose i'm starting out a fresh diff different case right its none of my business Not there. I am a youngster. I do something I want. I will say this First it has to start with inside you What is the capability? It is written in our Gita It has happened. Is it okay? fear of another's religion It generates. Follow your own religion. it Dharma is not religion. It means your nature. We God has given every person a gift Is. I gave you a gift. it was manifested You. Right? It doesn't happen to anybody Manifest. so important is what you Can you contribute? suppose i am saying Biotech and biological related issues are a big deal Business Opportunity Like Anti Aging in a few years it's already happening but when I talk to my friends you know I don't even know no weather we will die at 150 or what is Going to happen. So bio is an area. AI It is definitely an area. you know process Digitization is another area. so these are some of the emerging areas how ever it has got nothing to do with just potential it has to match with what you bring to the table are you getting my point There is no interest in AIA brother Why should I go there, I don't have a bio I am interested in what potential I will do I'm a good chef so I'll go eat My food is getting disrupted, brother It is a gift na hum it is my gift which God has given to me which I need to nurture are you are getting this gift i think a great Practice is a reflection of your own life There's a timeline and you're somewhere You've arrived and now have seed capital If you want to start a business then at that point Life experiences whatever happened before skill sets, courses done, studies etc. Scan everything and ask yourself: what did I find most interesting then Ask me whether I am interested in this Create a monetizable product or service can I or not? Absolutely. and if the answer yes begin. But there wouldn't be a triangle in it Is. Just interest is not enough. One There is interest. There is a potential And there is a skill set. the potential of the Industry of that person. Ok. I am good I will not sing today. But I love singing. so my I am interested. I don’t have the skill set. I have the potential. Some guru said that he will become a good singer. but today it's out of tune He sings. All three have to match and then Monetization has to come. so i am the answer to this I am giving it. Your question is very simple. Brother What business should I do? I am saying that this is You said that business locus of control has To be with you. which I read from the Gita Gave an example. Not this is Trudy. We The trend has got nothing to do if it doesn't Does not resonate with you. it has to be an Infatuation. You have to be 24 by saying in love with it. And If that idea hasn't occurred to you, brother. Get your job done quietly. we like i attended You know a book talk by some author. You Know. So this guy was asking this question that sir I want to do business, but I don't understand I am unable to understand what to do. So he said Son, get a job. Sir what is this answer? When a son falls in love with a girl, he says no the girl is in love with the boy Don't take advice. I can't live for you No matter how much the world opposes me, I will live With you. It is live in today's time. Our There is a wedding on time. That idea didn't come You should wait brother. It won't happen with trend. hum it is a wrong Approach to start with. let me twist a Question. So the big business stories would have been are just the beginning of those stories What happens? Ok. how know? how do you sniff out that yes this will be a good Business? So look, this is a very good question. Yours. Do you know what has happened many times? It is accidental. which have become big businesses many times Just a stroke of luck or accidental. Look, you are calling it accidental. my mind I feel that this is the result of friction. Ok? That can also be true. Yes. means that which I got it and started from somewhere began. Just started trading. As You said get ready brother, I got three for ₹2 If I sold it or got three for two then it was too much. Sold it for Rs. 2.25. So I started from there. So the answer to your question is look at the Trends and Look at What You Bring to the Table. his match end interest Capability or skill set and potential Its match and monetization then make a Business plan. Got it. of the next chapter Before I begin I would like to say that that I thought we would talk about something relevant Industries in the following chapter that these these are boring businesses sir which are the Actual Boring Businesses Where High There is potential. But because you said all this About finding your own rhythm before you Find the Business You Want to Do. A Let's talk about finding rhythm. So in the next chapter we are going to talk About Personal Systems That Age 22 to Assume What should be done till 30? Let's Map That's through some points. so let's begin The New Chapter. So what to do from 22 to 30 Needed? yes if you want to do a job we Again whatever we are discussing is job Versus Business. Right? Yes yes. If you job Do you want to be successful in this country? For this, one will have to crack a competition. Any Do one after 12th, IIT do it, do medical, do it after graduation Take. You know you get my point. so you have to From cracking UPSC, from CA to U Have to crack one competition to do well in a Job. Like a competitive exam. Competitive exam. it can be anyone Competitive. I am saying it could be for a Job and n Education. I suppose you crack IIT, u crack IM and u crack CA and you crack medical and architecture and there so many other things the nift there is NID THERE IS LAW. At first, only The engineer was a doctor. There are many. One I will have to crack the exam brother. and steve The story of jobs and college dropouts Right, delete it. This is the most ruined These are kids who drop out of college it's syndrome again you're taking an Outlier exception s the rule. An outlier and exception cannot be the Rule brother. Or so that's my first point. Get your education base right. have this much muscle power that even if I don't do business Will live a lifestyle as good and as near as possible Good as a middle scale businessman. Dude I I would also like to say one small thing. please 32 A Fairly Young As A Business Owner. I have this I noticed that teammates who had education Haven't completed vs. teammates has completed education it is always the once I completed the education which was done by grinding and We can do more. they don't let go of the Ball When the Ball Becomes Difficult to Because They had the religion power. Yes. that one Education builds resilience By completing it. choose a course you enjoy but Get it complete. don't be in the zone of Dropping out. That's my personal opinion. Very Rarely Drop Out Success Stories They happen in India. Even as a young person, I am very against this concept of Dropping out. And my risk appetite It is very big. Still, I am saying this. Based on what we have seen over the last 10 Years. Now please go answer. Ok? So First thing is, you are doing a job. consider yourself worthy of this Make sure you earn enough money. so that you have a Decent lifestyle. almost as good as a Middle scale business. I'm not a big Industrist. Seconds, get down to business. If you want to do business then first you should first know what i want to do which has The Potential and Make a Product Market Fit Hum There is a science behind the product Market Fit Right Product Market Fit You will do a feasibility study and create cash flow You will do the analysis and make an investment plan and while you're working you know what you make that's the plan and if you have a family and Somebody to Support You or You Can Raise Funds from the market you know either way that Equity Venture Cap Make a Proposal and Then Jump into it. we so this is the very very Simple way to navigate it for that job and A concrete business plan for your business Should be. we are ok you are business oriented Personal guidelines are given from 22 to 30. I would like to give you some human trade guidelines I would like to A first of all five days of jam Do the rubbing. If possible, six days a week. A Your own breaks, manage your own mind do it. Manage your own burnouts etc. but at the same time be very knowledgeable Seeing in this face. If it is not known that Which business should I enter or not? Listen to the podcast to see how it is done. End Find secondhand mentors. and Charap Mentors Should be. just to learn, just to learn About how the world works. and then ask The Write Questions. If only that was done And if the same mentors saw that this kid works hard that's half the battle one Because then they will guide you in detail that he you can start something like this a lot How to start agency business nowadays Freelancing business is a service business and i think that's fine you learn the Basics you learn how to play the game then After that, after a certain point, you will learn by yourself. Log through your own network through your own This product is also good for business associates We can start I think this is so much You have said an important thing. maybe the people Doesn't even know the meaning of mentor. and i can tell you ranvir people of me as you know who The sorts of corporate lives we live are more Then happy to give there time. we this is the The Only Way We Can Give Back to Society How Much We have got it. hmm so finding mentors is a big deal It is necessary. It will take hard work. and important thing This is someone who has never done business with you Get business advice. and who ever got a job You did not do that, you are taking job advice from him yes. So, the problem is within you. Pick the Right Mentor. you get my point or you go to surgery If you are not going to get it done by an engineer then right Grab a mentor and go proactively people will be happy to give time ok Moving On To Chapter Four Let's Talk About Relevant Industries as stated in India It is said that boring businesses make the most Money because this is a bit of a family business It is special. Right? I have noticed that family businesses are in Flourish in boring domains. Fair Two is absolutely fine. So boring India What are the business sectors? Look, tell me this Let's start from the beginning and talk about today. Sure, the sectors which are booming today have been. Let's say if we go a little bit earlier If we go then it will be much easier. Auto Auto components related if you look at the way the Companies have become multi-billion dollar Enterprises I mean before liberalisation you know what kind of cars we had in this country right so one is anything to do with Manufacturing with in manufacturing Auto Kind of Almost Like a Torch Bearer you know because liberalization happened in 91 Later in 93, 94, 95, Honda, General Motors, all these Applied for it. At that time, people who auto The way they became components Multi Billion Dollar Enterprises. this is a paradigm i M Giving. Now he is not there today. Because we R Moving Towards EV. Today Auto Components You don't have to put any money in it at all. Components will not be saved. the engine is going Is. Hum there is no IC engine. now what Is the way renewable energy. Anything to do with renewable energy is a Sector to be in and get associated with any way right that is one area i will say definitely look at okay it could be wind it could be solar you know it could be hydro so Renewable energy is a variant to anything And everything to do with ESG Environment Environment Sustainability & Governance ESG G related anything you You will because ESG is no longer a choice. There are mandates that if I have goods from you If you want to buy then you must have these compliances Needed So ESG related is a very big deal business which if somebody can crack the court Can make multi billion dollars. We are seconds third is you know related to again it's a Kind of an offshoot of ESG safety. First We didn't think that much. Wearing gloves, I am wearing a helmet. this employee safety, worker Safety has become a big industry and a Big Business to Sensitize Specially MSMEs. Where everything happens. Minimum Wages Even though I am not giving it, it is still going on. I Mean you know i have heard there are so many Factories. Their sources of competition The advantage is that he is not paying minimum wages Am. Imagine. So safety. Next I Will say is anything and everything to do with Artificial Intelligence and Digitization. And last is anything and everything to do With Bio and Pharmacy. Bio means bio Means the new developments that are taking place in The field of biology like anti-aging is One right disease is another one health related Stuff is another one. so much of research is Happening at the Frontiers Intersection of Bio with Even Physics. You no so i think there is a lot of development Happening there that is an area and pharma is there again something which i feel is continuing it will evolve there might be some disruption But it's going to be there for a long time time so the four five sectors are which i feel you know the end of course the last one i should Ad Which is an offshoot of What I Said Renewable Energy I Wood Say Anything Related to with energy because kiss will run on which one will we go and on which one is it okay Traditionally it is manufacturing Traditionally it has been manufactured but I'm saying manufacturing is back again boring but any of these areas also will Gel Well With This Generation write it will not be as boring but it also has a lot of potential got it. So Study these sectors and invest and get in through the easiest and the lowest Denomination Route in Terms of Investment end risk. Ok? talking about this Are. Let's go deeper. Ok? two additional questions Is. The first question is that these five-six How to bring profitability in industries? I think that's the main question. anyone should ask themself before thinking about Starting business. The second question is the game plan because not all these sectors I seem larger than life as a 22 year old How do I suddenly install a solar panel in an old graduate? How do I understand this, look I have seen it many people who started with solar Started with installation, now solar I want to install the panel in your home Do I need a plant? I am buying one am I importing it from China or Dada bought it locally, he is coming from outside. Ok? I am a contractor. Then What did that guy see? where does this item come from Used to be? so he started as a contractor Just An Installation Guy At Homes. Then What did he do? If friend comes from home Factory required. We don't think so At home but in the plant if my ₹1 The units were left and then he entered the plants. Then he started taking on bigger contracts Do. Then what did he say? Yaar Main Panels Should I start making it or trading? Karani then started manufacturing again. Now He has become very big. you understand? The contract is almost zero investment Raise. So I am saying, go inside. I I'm not saying you know you can become a renewal You know renewable energy and you can become you No start up a gigawatt of solar energy Plant. It will take time to reach there. But Enter the area. When you enter the solar panel You started walking on that path, you got a thousand Things came to light, all ecosystems came to light Who is the supplier, who is the buyer and who is purchasing it What are the factors then you can start with start to scale up when you get my point Let's take your YouTube example. like when you started how much would you have Learn and relearn but if you were working in In some other fields I don't know these news moving end may be 10 years back or when wherever you started you would never have Imagine that I will cover such a journey Kya Hum So A Journey Of 1000 Steps Starts with the first step right away The mile starts with the first step have to do it. so to answer your question Start with the minimum investment which can even be a contracting and Trading and then slowly building it up. it How to start contracting or trading We do? Just ask your friends. brother look So I'm starting this. you my Have to give 10 references. solar at home This is the advantage of the panel. whom shall I tell Should I take a meeting? at least this friend of i Mind that's how he started. Brother I I am starting a business. did a lot of job Year. Rajeev, I need 10 references and 10 each Asked people and educated them. from home Started and then he went to the factory. So it will happen by your network. as we are you know marwadi community, gujarati community, jain community have a lot of Support. so you have to see we are the network you can tap into whoever you ask bro If you need help then say come on friend, let's go Friend, stop picking up the phone. This is how it is today The world is like this. Tell someone your work He will stop picking up the phone. You tell someone friend He needs to be trained and given a job. That is the easiest way he will not block you. But he will start ignoring you. As such No network required. so to answer your Questions Look at Your Network People Who Want To you to do well seek out support that Boss, I am doing this, tell me how can you help me you can easily got it okay i think this is a variant point where we should bring up supply chain supply chain means what sir ok Please explain it easily, this is a very big business Career loan is a very important thing, see There are two types of things in the supply chain Inbound and Outbound Supply Chain What is it basically? what does supply chain mean Is? things to make any goods It seems so. to make things happen It happens. Ok? so if I get a product Have to make it. Let's get me a washing machine Have to make it. It has x number of parts. may be those parts are coming from various Geographies. Right? those geographies can be with in india can be outside of India. So one is an inbound logistics. Ok? Like a part of me has to come from China. One part has to come from Europe. one part russia Have to come from. Everything of mine is ready. One My part got stuck. something with china The problem started. We are a live example Is. Now I am not the kind of person who can use a washing machine Sir, it is not just a roller. take the rest Go. So it is important to understand this in the supply chain that's all the parts of the entire system from the time that Placing a parts order is a great help to that supplier. Is there capacity? Is that capacity in this timeline? I will probably meet everyone synchronize he is saying sir i I will give you the goods, call me again on 10th June Sir, I will give it on 10th July so what I will make it half and keep it aside, do you understand this point? yes it is in very crude language i understood I have been. Over simplified. so this is Inbound Logistics to Make Something. It Needs x number of parts. those parts should reach at one point in time so that i Can plan my manufacturing line. This This is part A. then there is outbound Logistics. After I have made the goods, I will give it to her I am transporting it. what's in it Is there a complication? The most important thing is Time of delivery. Logistics cost. what is the right board to you know should i put it on a truck, should i Put it on a you know the trailer? should i send Is it by train? should i if it is being Exported which is the nearest port. Should I send it to that port by train or bus? should I send it? Should I send it by truck or by trailer? Then transit is a very important thing Damages. How should the packing be? Fragile What is it? How fragile is it? The dent will come What? This is a basic supply chain. But What does it contain? where is the problem in that does it come? as i give you that example chain is Strong as the Weakest Link. If even a single part does not arrive on time then Your assembly line will stop. So if plant of car or any other car stopped working Understand the factory today, two, three or four people And I lost my job. It is like murder. So that is supply chain management. We Butt I only explain the part of timing match, Cost, Quality, Inbound Quality. My The quality of the product is dependent on My inbound quality. how to check that had been? What is its mechanism? How will the rejections happen? this whole piece Sounds boring. the money is in us Because trades are now mine and my circle me u know de sale construction de sale Tiles Now understand them in tiles 1 lakh square feet showroom built ok Made in Faridabad with let's Now what is their value addition in that Mall in Tiles Showroom in Faridabad I will see, maybe I will meet the person from Delhi Let me go and negotiate. Butt Manufacturing I believe you have that competitive advantage. Are you Getting my peace? Trading and You Know the Money and the margins are always going to be larger because you have more leverage in Manufacturing. in trading you are kind Of you know compressed. hmm means trading is a good starting point. it's a very Good starting point. because less capital Is. But again, what are you trading? His What kind of retail space is required for this? Online Tax You can, that's a good thing. but if you have a If you want a fancy place then it's not a good Point to start with. like you gov Example of cloud kitchen vs a fancy one restaurant. Got it. Ok. Summarize a little I would like to do it. basically if it's boring If you want to enter business then consider supply chain Management has to be learnt. Supply Chain If you want to learn management then my personal advice This is to find mentors and learn AI Use it. At least your learning speed will increase but the fastest way to increase Learning speed is to apply yourself. Absolutely. So you are saying that trading off a part of the supply chain that identifies Do it and get in there. Absolutely. that's why You can begin your business career. Exactly. then what before that part what comes and what comes after that is good Know from. Exactly. and at some point you You will learn yourself that yes, I am good at this thing I will be able to do manufacturing. and because of that This is part of the supply chain, this is mine It just happened. In addition this is the second The share will be mine too. Correct. this is The Basic Game Plan. That is absolutely correct. Ok. About A & Joe Industries You mentioned about the five-six industries. Same game plan applies across. so see if You go historically. Yes. We who are traders community or the trader community It has been there for 2000 years. Ok? since 2000 years Trade Lots of Traders Industrialists How to become it? Are traders just traders? Is it Marwari or Gujarati or Baniya? Are you a trader? they became got inu manufacturing but they started with Trading. You get my point? Yes. from the bad What would be bad? The stuff I bought, What you bought for ₹2 or what you bought for ₹200, I will sell it for 180, I will sell it for 160, that much I will sell only whatever I have. So Backward And then he did forward integration. hmm hmm because they got a foot in the door I got my foot in the door, where did you understand the whole system? what is missing but go inside and then built it you can't start with the Elephant right I mean you have to start Small Understand the Gaps and Then Build it up how much time does it take to go From Being a Trader to a Profitable Trader To become an industrialist one generation wow wow even today we are saying it will take one generation Meaning that it would take half a generation if one I didn't feel complete when I said what it meant 30 years of work harsh truth 15 20 years It will not seem so easy that you become a trader today And you become completely different because your mentality is completely different Is. The game is completely different. your talking to you Saying Trader Versus Industry A huge game change in manufacturing Is. So you can assume that for 20 years, you know true transition you know it can take that kind of time it can be done earlier also But I am saying that If you don't know the whole game If you close your eyes and enter in a hurry Chances of failure will increase You can do it exponentially faster but Haste is the devil's work. Nowadays we are not one Slang has become very popular. These Actually comes from the basketball world. Like his name is LeBron James. He is very He used to say this. It has now become a slang word Is. The slang word is generational wealth. We That means that Money like a dog. But the Truth About Generational Wealth Is 20 Years Old It seems so. Practically Speaking Minimum Maybe 30 years. He is not ready to do any To. We need it quickly because attention span It isn't there, right? See it in everything Same thing is happening in relationships also. Job Same thing is happening in me too. means in everything it's happening quickly quickly quick Quickie Quickie That's Instant Gratification. Brother, who will take 15 years? so what bro will you do it? Get bankrupt. we mean his The second option is this. so i wonder if you have Cracked the Formula. If you are trading a You learned a little bit better game plan Also made a for manufacturing. From If you're at your five year mark. can you Raise money to jump to the next level. and you Can but that also has to be calculated. it see I am saying this. the money they're giving you He is taking a bet on you. Hmm. Now Many people who become investors, after seeing this guy I also apply it. I have seen like I talk To these people, friend, what did you see? Business The plan was rubbish, the guy was on fire Buddy. That bastard will do something. the plan was rubbish The guy was right. We sleep like this too. but however If You're Wanting to Raise Money You Have to Show Some proof of concept. I am your brother Why should I believe it? what am i betting On? Am I betting on your idea? Am I Betting on Your Potential and Am I Betting On your execution capability? Any because i have to secure my money na that It is important that you have to answer this question In your mind why should somebody invest That's Money on Me and the Biggest Myth Vi The youngster's idea was great. The idea of There is no money. execution money Execution Your Capability Your Team Your fire in the belly bl bl bl the sigma of All that we know in this chapter, haven't you? Golden nuggets have been given. if someone likes I would have said this at age 22 thank you sir but the truth is of this chapter The chapters that came earlier are more important is for the audience to learn to handle Yourself. Learn to handle your finances. Learn to handle growing in your career. So we will move on to the next chapter. Ok? which is also a small case study but at the Same time it's mainly for family businesses. Because this topic has not been covered in this And I feel it's a very different topic on the show. because those who are also freshers who have I have never even started a business. whose Even families don't have businesses You will get the perspective. but this is for Families Who Are Trying to Figure Out How to Make The Businesses Grow Further Pass It On To The Next generation to scale sure okay a first Let’s start with a case study Ambani case study loosely you can explain it what did Dhirubhai Ambani do and then Ah what did you say to Mukesh Ambani loosely speaker And then what did Mukesh Ambani do? What is the plan for the third generation. So this is you know obviously based on not my First Hand Experience But Whatever I have seen heard observed so dhirubhai also Started as a trader, we trade Then after that Wright came into manufacturing Textiles and plastics came into those things then he took a very big risk which is called jamnagar refinery now let me tell you When the Jamnagar refinery was being set up and He created capacity and some of the people who work with him at that time i have had work with them and they said I too had told Dhiru Bhai that Sir once Think about it, it's not that big of a risk It's okay and this is something I heard I put this disclaimer on my own I am here so he said what will happen No sir, whatever you have done in all these years I have made it, it will become zero sir, that's all No We will start again, this is Dheeru Bhai I AM sure he would have secured the family i am I'm not very sure about that Ranveer because whenever Jamnagar refinery's jo risk hai somebody has to salute that person to take that kind of risk and the People have head in many places it is mentioned panchratna you know the really great team he had at least one or two people i know because i work with them like they are like i would touch their feet Any time means that it is respect He said we stood correct it. We Also tried to stop the hand. he said Look friend, I listened to everyone. not like that It is that Dhiru Bhai used to ignore that I have The Answers. He said, okay tell me what is the risk? This is capacity risk. Capex Risk Is. Sensitivity analysis. you know this is a the very thing that if I assumed This much stuff will be sold. if it is not sold so much If production does not happen, will there be a loss? These He said this after listening to everything. I heard all Of you with full respect. but we are Going Ahead as an Entrepreneur This is my There is a call. so you understand and that was the Game changer for Reliance Jamnagar refinery has built reliance because the kind of Scale Cash Flows Everything It Brings You Know Did everything for Reliance. understand this point I came. now we go to the next what I saw when I was working in that company is that which Mukesh bhai inherited He did that before I left Reliance this How much did you build and grow but what what has happened in the last 10-15 years is so The One Transformation That Reliance Went Through This is what we call reincarnation or avatar Vaz Dhiru bhai to Mukesh bhai but I think third An incarnation has taken place which no one is seeing. like those Great people whose feet I touch even today I will touch it. He said we stand corrected In front of Dhiru Bhai Will. I also stand I am corrected. I am confessing today. When he was investing in Jio. End I had some idea how much you were doing. 50000 It became crores. Then Rs 1 lakh on top of that. They I said, brother, the ship will shake, brother. Then you are coming into consumer brands. You So you are the king of B2B, friend. Where to Be Are you entering B? Where to enter retail had been? Where are you getting into telecom? I also thought that this is the right Strategy? Because you are great at being to be You are not so good at being a jerk. but what did did it happen? what happened? today they are ruling Even there. so to move from be to be like I said it takes a generation, right, trader? to become a B2B manufacturer It probably takes one lifetime to go from B to C It cannot happen and maybe it cannot happen Like Schneider Electric or ABB So washing machines will someday come in B2C will you make it But Reliance did it and culturally too A lot has changed now when I go there it is a different company so imagine a petroleum ium company a petrochemicals company gates Innu Consumer Facing Business Gets In The The Next Generation Stitches It and Builds It. I mean what could be a better story Then that. I think a lot of young people do this Believe that Ambani family has a no Golden hands are such that they can handle anything with their hands If applied it turns into gold. but it's not Like that. Look at those businesses which don't take off Are. So Reliance is always in project Stage. We used to watch this many times parallelly, friend Which team is this? What are they doing? There are many projects when 100 people are sitting together They keep studying and many don't even do that. Do. but I would also think that this is The Golden Hand Theory Seems to Be Right Because it would be hard to find a business In which they field. We But At Reliance Core Something is going right mentally. Culturally, Mentality Wise, A Strategy Wise. So what is that core? So look at the core I I can only tell you my own experience Because I also mean limited visibility I was in a product line when I first started I did the presentation and I went on a Honda So brother MAC, there is some tension when I did the first one and this is to show you the mentality I made great preparations for my first presentation and one of the Executive Directors relating to Mukesh bhai Sheetal Miswani was there My bosses were big people, He said if you do it then I am Chotu Ram you know He is a DGM level guy. they are all to I started the presentation. the first or It was on the second slide. He said, son, sit down. I said no sir, no no sit down. Rajiv, why did you ask these three questions? made? I said Sir, who is related to Petroleum We want to open petrol pumps, its channel There is a strategy. Ok. so we companies have you Benchmarked? I am BPCL this December. No no no we are not talking about India have been. Which global company did you choose? Have you seen it in petroleum? I said global So I did not see it. good but you I don't want to look at petroleum. You have 71 Store Dekha which is the best franchise Model in the world? 71 McDonald's did you Study Duncan Donuts We will start with a global scale was a because i have worked in Honda which is a multinational but the thinking is what Happened? My third presentation was discussed did not go to the slide. and i learn my lesson that Gupta ji you should improve yourself if you come here If you want to survive then one thing is to think Global but there is a difference between Thinking Global: Many people think global, but I Call That Sabse Baagh and Sheikh Chilli Ke Khwab They also make it happen that's the one difference. so fire you know that fire in the belly that go Getter Attitude Having the Teams in Place Having the monitoring mechanisms in place Having the Resources in Place People in place and they are way ahead of time when I when i joy them i mean everything was Online in 2002 means I don't have prescriptions I had to make a book of leaves in 2002 so I did a book He used to make leave slips in a multinational company or go out to the factory to sleep They have adopted technology for so long We can only see the glitter outside. But what goes in is that we don't see. So This is the mentality. Think Global But Make It happens. We and what will it take to make can it happen? We Ok. Now the same case from a practical point of view Let us analyse the study. for first Generation Entrepreneurs Like Me. Mukesh Ambani is like God for us. that wow What a business story. but honestly we Can only aspire to be Dhirubhai Ambani. Is there truth in the statement? Absolutely Ok. no you can only aspire to be Dheeru bhai. because when you start you The advantage that Mukesh Bhai got will be available to you too Not there. ok and in order to become a The Potential Dhirubhai Ambani We Need Too Master Everything We Have Spoken About Till This Point in the Podcast. Absolutely. Correct. Now let's talk about the second generation Are. So there are two questions. The first question is that What do you think Dhirubhai Ambani said about Mukesh Ambani? What did others teach Ambani on a core level? Then the technicalities? The second question is that in a 2020 keeping the context in mind If a family run business is to be taken to the next generation What to keep in mind when training a Needed? So I have to only guess. so what do i think That Dhiru Bhai Ji needs to be taught something It might not have been there. s i always say children Learn by watching the parents. so i think Value systems that are go-getters for hard work And if you have decided about it then you have to do it. i think this is what would have been definitely transmitted not merely through the DNA and through the blood but by living in the Same house and working in the same company. So Working Hard Having a Gotter Attitude and whatever you set out to do don't leave your College in Between. If you have picked it up then you have to do something boss Let that reliability power focus on the Controllables and Cuts Off the Noise Exactly so i think this spirit of work hard Global Thinking Think Big Think Really Big Think Global because I think one of Reliance There is an unspoken strategy. Any we business We have to be number one in India And top three in the world. it's very clear. Number one in India, top three in The World. So that is the thinking of many people we god these are the learnings that dhirubhai Ambani Possibly Passed On To Mukesh Ambani or i have heard something similar in most Conversations that have had around this topic Now! I would like to ask you that a 2020 keeping the context in mind What a business owner teaches his kids so that's the second generation goes way Beyond the first generation. Ok. So it's very crude but I think that which is our mind, body and habits There is a lot of need to correct this generation a little. There is need. so i give a simple example that I haven't seen at least in my life in time that any person can do 40 hours or 45 Hours may be available in the next generation. Address will it work after 20 years or any 20 hours or 15 or Can one be successful by working for 20 hours? so the first thing is that you have to have a body which can get out of the house at 8:00 am and get into the house at 8:00 p.m. End it's like 12 hours including commute and You should be okay with it. hmm because those 12 in hours just because of the environment You will learn a lot. Exactly outside You will go from home, it is commute time. so one is that Second, this is the get rich quick theory no I think whatever is teaching you or as many people i think that should be really Thrown out the window. The third thing is this If I am a family business owner. we are Talking of second gem. I think as a father I will carefully assess that this is my child Hey again what did I say? interest, Capability and Potential. if these three If my child is sitting in a triangle, then how do I fit that into this business and How do I train him? but if I think is that he is not going to be able to Succeed and fit into my shoes and I am that Business owner then I will create another system End process. So that the business continues, The Life Style Continues and This Person does something align with his interest, capability and potential which is one way today traffic is that if you are not in this business If it comes you can't do anything. But even if Even if you want to do hard work, mentoring, Ecosystem, relationships, all this will have to be done. so i think as the next gen as a second Generation Owner and First Generation Passing to the next jan what i will do i would do is I would tell them it's absolutely fine to Be out and about for 12 hours in a day I am working hard because I don't want to die There is no need to curse Gaya. you should Be Grateful That You Have So Many Hours of Work Is. Hmm, the day when I will sit idle The day will come when you will understand what happens. Being Busy is a privilege is a privilege It is necessary. and you know your understanding interest this thing and also understanding your weaknesses that this is what I can do and this is what I can't Doo. i think these are the few things i would Like to know transfer to the next Generation. but as the owner as the custodian of the Business which I have set up. I will ensure that I am putting the best person out there not my son not my daughter If that person is not the best suited person For the interest of the business we get you the Point Yes Now you are basically saying that the child's Recognize the personality if personality if it is not suitable then rather take care of yourself Business not your child yah. and figure it out How to take care of child's future. Absolutely. The person whose upbringing is different, The guy for whom everything is different, why are you Trying to convert him into your image? God has made each individual in him Different image. Right? So, I am saying this I am here to take this business forward What should my child be like? Right? To be smart, to be clever, you know, to be savvy, I will do all this by being a little political. And If I feel, Bhaiya, we cannot do this If that's the case then I will professionalize the company I will do it but he won't be sad my friend What God, what a donkey you created such a thing Language is business, is a donkey born from it? Maybe my wife also heard the sound Give me what a bastard you have brought out, what is all this these are useless things, may be he is meant to do something else than i will not have further quarrel with that issue but I will Professionalize the Company Put True Structures that the business of these places should also continue keep doing it. Last time today a lot There are huge options. Sell ​​the company friend To. You have a company worth Rs 250 crore or Rs 500 crore. Ok? Your EBITDA from LETS is 10%. EBITDA is in a very bad state at 15%. Ok? So how much is it? 75 crores Went. There must be some valuation. you sell off Do it to the company. Create wealth and give it away To the children. Slowly after taking out IPO Unlock your wealth. So why are we in the same We are stuck in our own labyrinth, My son will take care of it. there are ways to Unlock that Wealth and Create the Well Being For the future generations. but the dispute is in our mind is family for the business or is Business for the Family. we are there for purpose The needle gets stuck in it. Wow. Because there is no clarity in this itself. Why do you want to do business now? friend of the kids Life style should be good. Ok? So Unlock his wealth. sell it to him Make a system. Yes, if business is morant then family, then another structure was added to it Two. That's the only way out. Hmm. but why It's Just Quarreling and Fighting It's Not Going to happen. Understood and Absorb everything you said so but that's why it's not Shocking to me that there are many such people in our country all are business families which have gone Beyond Gen Two Gen Three Gen Three and the Ambanis Themselves Are Gen Three Right Now I don't know what's gone right now. I know We have addressed this in the past. butt so i Let me answer this. Latest Survey Shows and i'm not surprised the number could be Peacock. 50% off the next does not want to join The Family Business. But according to me it might be 70 or 80 Survey says 50. Why? I have family The benefits that you are getting from the business I want it but I don't want to die. What is the reason His? There are two reasons. Boring Business End Somebody breathing down my neck. That means that Father. Papa Uncle Uncle Grandfather Elder Cousin Elder Sibling the list is endless Brother, minimum what I have seen is very few like this there will be families that are somewhat of the same size that It's father and son, there must be uncle Because the brothers of the grandfather were different If there are four people then the minimum number of uncles will be cousin and that is fine and if there is a sibling then let don't want to breathe people down The Neck second and this was you know some recent one of the person who enrolled in our course told I say sir if you will teach me then I don’t want to do the family business Why do you say sir there is no break in life Why do I say anything sir my mind is cooked Those things happen in the morning as well as in the afternoon They didn’t let me do anything even in the evening I want my sir to be like this Make me do the course so that I can get a job the issue is a money is an accept The business was interesting enough to match with the Kids But 50% Off The Kids Don't Want To Run The Family Business. now how do we solve that problem and imagine what would be that Number? There are 6.3 crore MSMEs in this Country. Ok? I think that's the number. Now What will happen? their children cannot drive Want. Are they lying outside or their life Is. that's the problem this country needs to Solv. So what will happen to these businesses? Close will it happen or the wealth will be unlocked or sold Will go. Whatever can be sold will be sold. which is not It can be sold, he will run it as long as he can. That's what so happens. I remember when I I was 22 years old and when I was with my friends I used to watch lives. Where the friend is someone's family This is business. i thought to myself that wow what A platform. you know i wish i had that Platform. i could grow it into something Hughes. but then again as I grow older I get this I want to know that friend you can't always do it completely Empathize with people you don't know what What's actually happening behind closed doors Isn't it true that I am crazy in love with my pain I don't know of any other one, I will give you an example a guy from a top b school ok son of a Big Industrialist he is crying okay recently i met this Cow he was literally crying says sir A man committed a big mistake in his life, he is the only son That the school also came on top in the family business was in a dying state, as much as the head If I got breath I would have come If I could breathe, I would tell you how am I today my piercers they are getting multi Crore salary because he is from a top b Graduated from school 15-16 years ago He says, Sir, no one is worth even Rs.1 lakh per year to me.
