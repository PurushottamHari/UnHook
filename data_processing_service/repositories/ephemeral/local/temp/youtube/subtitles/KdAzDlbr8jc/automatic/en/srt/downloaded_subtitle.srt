00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,319
hello. Loosely you can explain that

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,440
What did Dhirubhai Ambani tell Mukesh Ambani

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,759
Said. Don't enjoy the things I created.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,599
Earn your stripes. But today I

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,839
I am confessing. I also stand

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,840
I am corrected. When that investment of Jio

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,680
Was doing. I was working for Reliance.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,600
I said brother where are you going in telecom

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
I don't feel like it, better to stay in the business.

113
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,800
This is where to go brother? What is direction?

114
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,160
Because direction will set the condition. We

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Why do you need to go? What is the purpose? How else

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,520
Want to go? What is our path? These three things

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,199
There should be crystal clear documentation

118
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,039
Needed We are ok. That's all. That's it. Ok.

119
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
break down all these questions further

120
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,720
Will download it during the podcast. Sure.

121
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:59,039
Ok. next question. There are a lot of such businesses

122
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,240
that fade away overtime

123
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,199
Or they have a downfall. so the most common

124
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,319
What is a mistake? any long term

125
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,639
Of successful business? what happens many times

126
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
that when a man gets success then we

127
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,000
She climbs on top of his head. He thinks of me

128
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,520
All the answers come on . and when he says

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,280
that I get all the answers, then I get intoxicated with that

130
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,759
He takes such a hazardous risk

131
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,759
which is not driven by data and the

132
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,080
Reality it is driven by the ego. and in that

133
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,479
What happens is that he takes a gamble. It

134
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,840
It is very different from a business risk. And

135
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,800
That gambling is often driven by ego. End

136
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,120
it ain't back by numbers and then whatever

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,319
built it falls flat on the face and

138
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,560
Off the story. Ok? Because this is a scaling

139
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,520
The business is special. Family Business Special

140
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,800
Is. So the question to you is, what

141
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,720
Successful businesses are in the long term

142
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,280
Their owners give their children three main tips

143
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,599
What do you usually give? look at the kids

144
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
One thing parents say is work hard.

145
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,440
They always think that it is about our time, friend

146
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,319
I used to work very hard. First is hard work

147
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,840
do it. Second is blindly trusting someone

148
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,360
Do not do it. Make friends wisely too.

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,319
And the third thing is that friend, this is something I made

150
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,280
Don't be lazy over it. standing on your feet

151
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,440
show. Earn your stripes. he always

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,199
They want that okay I will make it for you

153
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,919
I have been. But I worked so hard

154
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,720
Made. What did you do for yourself? you have

155
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,440
What did you do differently? So their always

156
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,840
There is advice and there is concern as well

157
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,880
that is until he gets on his own feet

158
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,919
If they stand up, then what I'm going to give them

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,400
They won't be able to handle even that. We are ok.

160
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,280
Just expanding this question, one

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,840
I will ask practical questions. a business

162
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,560
It is said in the circles that Ambani

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,039
He is the third generation of the family and is very capable

164
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,080
This is an age compared to other business families. it

165
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,160
Why is it being said? See, that is why it is said

166
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,720
It is happening because the results are coming. if you

167
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,879
Look at this, divide the business so intelligently

168
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,879
to be done. it's not easy to divide

169
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,680
Reliance empire but its DNA of the

170
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,639
Divide the child according to their DNA

171
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,520
to be done. Governance mechanisms were put in place.

172
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,479
and the potential of the business and potential

173
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,000
Off to the next jan was matched. that is

174
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:29,120
Forest. The second thing is the scale of Reliance

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,159
I am sitting on it you know I use the term escape

176
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,320
velocity that is almost escape velocity

177
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:40,800
Is. people process system governance it's a

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,279
Well oiled machine. So if the children are not capable

179
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,080
Even if it were there it would be very difficult to destroy

180
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,320
to do. But kids are capable. Our

181
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,800
I have seen grandfather. saw your father

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,760
Is. I have seen him working hard. so what would have happened

183
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,720
Is? When you watch kids learn from you,

184
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,760
We don't learn by speaking. So that DNA, that

185
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Hard work, that self-sacrifice comes into it.

186
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,480
That's the reason everybody is very sure that

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,200
This generation is going to do well. We are ok.

188
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,040
No sir during this entire podcast I am a

189
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,680
First generation entrepreneur

190
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,480
I will also talk to Perspective. Absolutely. And

191
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
People who are going to inherit the business

192
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,560
From your parents and also from their perspective

193
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,920
I will ask questions as we move forward. Ok. A

194
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,720
The next question is asked in India that most

195
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,839
There is more money in boring businesses.

196
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,320
Which is not glamorous. Why? Look boring

197
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,320
What is business? For the children of today.

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,160
Its name is manufacturing.

199
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,200
Manufacturing means in a factory

200
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,600
to go, to the shop floor, to have a fight with the labour

201
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,279
doing, looking after the machines, quality

202
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,200
Look And it is repetitive. But if we

203
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:54,720
View MSMEs There are total MSMEs

204
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,680
you know almost 60% of them are in the

205
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,279
Manufacturing sector. so that's why it said

206
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,560
It seems that the dude is boring. But if we

207
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,880
Think carefully, which country?

208
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,880
Grew up without manufacturing? We

209
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,200
Who has become big on the strength of trading?

210
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,920
So manufacturing is needed but there is fun in it

211
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,480
It does not come because there is repetition in it. so this

212
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,800
The saying is true. but the next generation

213
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,000
So I want to say this brother, it is like this.

214
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Have patience. It is feeding your bills. It

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,279
is feeding you know all yours which is good for you right now

216
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,079
If you are living a lifestyle then go with it

217
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,079
Learn. Behind glamorous things all the time

218
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,160
There is no need to run away. Yes sir. My

219
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,000
I also have my own business. it's a talent

220
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,240
Management company. is a media agency. Very

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,519
Monk is considered a glamorous company

222
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,680
Entertainment. Ok? but we have built it

223
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,320
Over Seven Years. and we've seen the wear and tear,

224
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,800
I have seen struggles and challenges. and at this

225
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,440
Point being, young business professionals are

226
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,839
I have found out that at some point there is no such person

227
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
Business should be started where repeatability is important

228
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,519
Factor it in the product. where you can

229
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,839
Design a Product Once and Keep It Growing

230
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,880
For ever. You have said this very well.

231
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,920
because if we're doing customized things

232
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,880
not as many times as in manufacturing

233
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,880
Is? Your dis became yours if it is a mass

234
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,279
produced manufacturing than you are

235
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,160
Absolutely right, you worked hard, then you

236
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,200
Can reap the benefits for some point of time

237
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,399
The business you mentioned brother is digging a well every day

238
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,640
and drink water everyday and come to a well the next day

239
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
should be excavated more thoroughly because

240
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
A lot of people have come. so you absolutely

241
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,600
Right. ah you know sir i think the audience

242
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
also by now it has been understood that the businesses which

243
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,680
Only those businesses which are profitable are cool businesses. Today's

244
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,560
That face of the world has gone where the coolness of business

245
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,880
To be or not to be depends on their raise capital

246
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,000
Was dependent. at this point people

247
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,399
Appreciate Businesses That Make Money. And me

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,200
I believe that in modern day India

249
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,160
99% of the profitable businesses are

250
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,440
Repeatability based. It's absolutely fine. One

251
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Something you can repeat every day

252
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,839
Every year and then learn to scale it. yes

253
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
Absolutely. Fair to perfectly fine.

254
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,720
I will give him coaching today. Ok. Moving on.

255
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:17,120
Name of the most iconic group of our country

256
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,839
It is Tata Group. for 160 years

257
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Have been profitable. they grew there overall

258
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,079
Group of Businesses. So his three businesses

259
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,279
I would like to know the secrets. Ok. I think

260
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,120
Great question. The first thing is that Tata

261
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,279
that the whole family has been right from

262
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,839
Founder Till Ratan Tata never owned

263
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,040
There was no feeling at all. Custodianship

264
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,279
Brother, I am the custodian of the next generation.

265
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,120
I am not the master of what I want to enjoy

266
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:50,480
Have to do it. First. Second Thing Joe Society

267
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,519
It's a give back thing. Now we are the people

268
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,399
No CSR has come, give me 2%. there was no rule at that time

269
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:01,760
It was not there. but you know the way back 70 years back you

270
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,519
no there was a crush in the factory for

271
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,240
women we you know there were benefits that did

272
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,160
not exist in corporate India which is Tata

273
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,680
used to give so concern for society give back to

274
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,639
Society and take care of your employees

275
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,560
The three building blocks that remained came butt

276
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,839
Will add a fourth one wherever the business goes

277
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,920
Zero compromise with value system

278
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,360
I can tell you from my friends who work

279
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,120
V Tata, many times he says friend speed money

280
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
you understand what is speed money they call it

281
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,920
yes brother its no big deal we will do it slow

282
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,320
I will not give you money so you have to be able to stand

283
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,480
The ground is fine friend, there will be loss of business

284
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,959
Never mind, I will stay Value Systems

285
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,720
So of these three, you said three and I said the fourth one too

286
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,760
I added I think that is very rare and

287
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,560
If these value systems were maintained

288
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,440
you know i think this company is there for

289
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,680
Eternity and this lesson everyone should learn

290
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:07,360
Patience and Thank You Patience and Thank You

291
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,199
Nice or OK Another Hypothetical Practical

292
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,399
Question

293
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,360
According to you our country's superstar

294
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,360
What does Shahrukh Khan tell his son Aryan

295
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,120
will say about business because said

296
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,760
It is said that Shahrukh Khan is the most popular actor in Bollywood

297
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,399
He is the best businessman. Absolutely. aryan khan

298
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,720
What will you call it? You will tell them this, son

299
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,760
Have you seen me? What time do I sleep?

300
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,760
I get up at what time and I

301
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,480
What condition have you become in? he is exactly of

302
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,680
My Age. Ok? he has to first tell son

303
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,519
One doesn't become Shahrukh just like that. To become Shahrukh

304
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,040
Working 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 hours for

305
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,920
Does matter. And with so much wealth and fame

306
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,160
Even after I'm Not Singing on My Laurels.

307
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,079
Now I have become one. So first of all he

308
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,440
will teach you what I asked you at the beginning

309
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,920
Hard work is non-negotiable. The second Shahrukh

310
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,120
A very important thing is that everyone

311
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,000
take along with you respect he knows how to

312
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,959
Respect people wether it is a fan wether it

313
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,880
is an extended family and friends only

314
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,880
Nos How to Respect People. i think that

315
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,639
Is the second tip he is going to give him.

316
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,839
and thirdly he will tell I am sure to Aryan

317
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,279
that son look at your father and grandfather

318
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,079
Where have we come from and all this

319
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,160
Even after it happened, it did not come to my mind

320
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,279
I am still grounded, my son is grounded

321
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,639
stay in the air don't float because in the air

322
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,120
If you swim then your path will be somewhere above

323
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,279
Nor does it let you fall anywhere. i think these are the

324
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,959
Three things I'm sure he would be telling me

325
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,279
Aryan Hum from Personal Finance Perspective

326
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,360
what will you say? From personal finance, this is

327
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:51,279
they will say that look friend it is like this if there was one

328
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,720
This is personal wealth. Ok? insulate it

329
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:58,000
Take it from business. We are making sure that the business grows

330
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,959
It may continue going down. So whichever one of yours

331
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,279
You have become accustomed to the lifestyle. So

332
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,160
May it continue for you. so I'm sure he will

333
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,120
Create those iron walls which anyone is smart

334
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,320
Business family dude this is my personal

335
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,720
For well being, you know we are your bread and butter

336
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,040
Understand those cars that end lifestyle

337
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,480
separate that from the business i think that

338
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,199
would be his great advice because business

339
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Despite being a good leader, anything can

340
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,199
Happens. Business means risk. it can be

341
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
because of you it can be insight of your

342
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,880
Best efforts. i think that's what he

343
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,480
Will definitely tell him. because shahrukh is

344
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,199
Also Come from Ambal Beginning and Jo Ambal

345
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,680
There is a beginning somewhere or the other

346
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,600
leaves an imprint of insecurity and

347
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,000
It lasts for two-three generations. so i am

348
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,480
Surely this thing will be secure, boss

349
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,320
Do it and go. Akshay Kumar sir came on the show.

350
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,959
I also asked him whether

351
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,440
There is a middle class boy inside you right now

352
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,519
Too. He said yes absolutely. He Said

353
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,399
That. Because of that, hard work is being done. Absolutely

354
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,839
Correct. So it's a super power almost came. Yes.

355
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,400
So here we have talked about Tatas, Ambanis

356
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,760
I have talked about it, I have talked about Shahrukh Khan.

357
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,720
I want to ask you a little googly question,

358
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,360
Those who are the top of the top people in India

359
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,679
What is their personal finance strategy often?

360
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,919
it occurs? See what they do? To all

361
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,880
This is their important strategy.

362
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,000
Don't put your eggs in one basket. We are the first

363
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,959
The thing is this diversified portfolio. Second

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,799
Don't Trust One Wealth Manager.

365
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,000
Have multiple wealth managers. third

366
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,400
take a mix of people you know who are managing

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,799
Your Wealth. take a mix of people you don't

368
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,200
No Pure Professional. i think anyone

369
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,200
A smart guy works with these three things.

370
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Hum because this is the only way to diversify

371
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,240
And mitigate your risk. We don't know all the eggs

372
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,400
So, you have to put an asset with a person

373
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,480
Do you want to put him in class? This is my friend

374
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,280
This has to be given to him. A friend as well as a professional

375
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,160
is also there. I think this is what they follow and

376
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,559
No wonder they do well. I mean if you see me last

377
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,280
Three Four Years and That's What If You See

378
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,440
Any studies I mean the wealth of the richest

379
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,000
People in the country in three years would have

380
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,480
More than doubled may be B may be 2.5x. We

381
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,720
Or is this what the middle class of our country has to learn?

382
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,600
To. absolutely how to get there

383
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,520
arrived and after reaching there further

384
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,720
how to go?

385
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,120
to further that questions and are considered

386
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,919
that the richest people in our country

387
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,280
His maximum money is in real estate

388
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,240
specifically land it's true this is absolutely correct

389
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,080
Is. okay because look what that land's

390
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:46,000
Our faith is firm in us that brother

391
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:48,720
land, land, property, gold, so land comes first

392
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,640
It comes. but again it depends on whom you

393
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,799
You are talking about net worth. if you are

394
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,160
talking somebody with multimillionaire crore you know

395
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:02,480
sort of asset base than he would have been

396
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,600
25 30% In The Land's End Among Others. you get

397
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,840
My point? But whose net worth is slightly less.

398
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,640
may be the proportion of land may be higher in

399
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,200
That. because it entered the human mind

400
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,240
It has happened. Why is it in the ground? This big

401
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,600
It is important. Firstly by selling the land

402
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,320
Can't eat it. I spent my money today so you

403
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,240
R. Force. It's a force locking. Second

404
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,919
Everybody knows that God has stopped making

405
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,320
Land.

406
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,000
It will increase further. Wow!

407
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,480
So brother, plant it in the ground, better late than never

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,200
But it is a good investment so

409
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,919
but as I said once you reach a very

410
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,720
High level because then you also get wealth

411
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,440
advisors who will explain you that sir land

412
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,240
Apart from this there are other asset classes also. Butt Up

413
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,320
To A Certain Networth I'm Saying

414
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,520
about 50% and may be closer to 50% would be

415
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,679
In Land. We are a

416
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,559
I hope the audience understands how much value it has

417
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,280
You are getting this short power from MBA

418
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,760
yes. And just 10 minutes have passed off

419
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,120
Recording. Still, I am saying this. Sir

420
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,600
The question is that in those business families

421
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,960
There are only daughters in today's era 2025

422
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,120
In. There is a family patriarchal mentality

423
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,280
It is different. What is happening? Reality

424
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,080
What is there in India? The look is totally different.

425
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,080
If you have a son and a daughter, compare them

426
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,720
If they do it then it is very clear. daughter's wedding

427
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,400
I invested all my business in my son

428
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,679
Will go. This still happens today. it is the same today

429
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,480
Is. That's why I always say that you

430
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,120
I thought that whatever my friend gives to my daughter in marriage

431
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,559
I gave what I had to give. He came back after 5 years

432
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,039
Went. The law says it is 50%. So the fight

433
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,799
If you are getting it installed then please clarify. But

434
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,840
Your question is different. If there are two daughters

435
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,840
There are two ways in which business owners win

436
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,159
I talk to him. one says brother

437
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,559
It is like that. Both are daughters. A daughter

438
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,720
I am interested in business but not one.

439
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,080
But both get equal share of the business

440
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,120
Give. The second one is a musician. Second

441
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,520
Wali is a teacher. the second one is doing

442
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,200
Research in America. Equal shares for both

443
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,000
will get. Now comes the time to talk. Some?

444
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,799
People say that I involve my son in law

445
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,840
I will take it. I have no problem. Butt enough

446
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,280
business family especially of our community

447
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,200
She says brother son in law does his work

448
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,440
Will do it. The daughter will do her own thing. Governance

449
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,000
I will install the mechanism. No to these losses

450
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,039
I will let you enter into the business. It is very clear.

451
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,840
So his view is very clear that if

452
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,000
if there are daughters, they will be given shares and they

453
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,960
Run a business, whether one or two

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,080
Run it and both daughters will get equal share.

455
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,360
Our ethical and legal angle is that

456
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,679
There should be an exact correct division. whether

457
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,400
boy girl if there are two boys and one girl

458
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,039
So 1/3 is 1/3 . we are one boy one girl

459
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,200
If it is then it is 50-50. and if you don't do that

460
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,600
Look, I am saying that the law says something.

461
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,080
But some norms remain in our culture

462
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,120
In. There is one thing in culture that now a friend lives in a house

463
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,840
For example, my father has a whole house

464
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,080
Is. There is a whole building. now it's commercial

465
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,000
Went. My parents are living with me now.

466
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,760
No. So where will the daughter come from? give it to him

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,080
I gave it. So it will be in my name only.

468
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,679
I am giving an example of a house. This way

469
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,960
He's son is taking care of the business, isn't he?

470
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,440
So the marriage took place. But I am saying this law

471
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,000
Ever since the change has happened and I am doing every business

472
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,600
Because of family, this course is also different

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,080
Consulting is the first thing I ask you

474
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes brother, did you think of this or not? No

475
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,120
Didn't think about it. Why didn't you think

476
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,480
Brother? Think, Discuss, Document and

477
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,000
Tell me this is the plan. not to daughter

478
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,320
I will give it or I will not give 50%. I will give you 25%

479
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,960
Because the son is driving. it has to be

480
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,240
Fair and Equitable.

481
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,159
Look, there is a word called equal and equitable.

482
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,440
There is no talk of equal. it has to

483
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:59,200
B. Equitable. Means it has to be fair. It

484
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,320
has to be based on some formula and some

485
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,640
Method. It can't be arbitrary. It is very

486
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,640
Clarity is necessary in the case of girls

487
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Should be. If children, if by chance your

488
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,240
It is like this in the mind, in the subconscious mind that

489
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,280
If you do not give 50% to your daughter then it should be clear

490
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,600
Why should I not give it? I wonder that such

491
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,640
What are the girls thinking? I'm Dead

492
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,400
sure that according to them it's a no

493
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,600
brainer that i am 50%

494
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:33,200
It's a no-brainer. Today's generation JX

495
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,840
You talk to Jane and they know the law and

496
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,960
you know i have you know i like in my house

497
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,559
Daughters We Can't Even Talk About Equality

498
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,880
meaning you are saying why are you saying that

499
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,520
means is there something in your mind that it is not equal

500
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,640
do you get the drift why is this question even

501
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,480
that is equal of course it is equal so I am

502
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,360
sure so this is a very nice thing ranveer ki

503
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,679
Parents are probably thinking, oh no brainer

504
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,640
It belongs to the son and what is the daughter thinking

505
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,640
Brainer is 50% mine how big is the rift

506
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,520
and you are sowing the seeds of what chaos will happen

507
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,440
This happens in every business family

508
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,000
Sorting this out and fixing it is a lot of work

509
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,400
It is important what happens in America and Europe

510
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,559
it's exactly like this is no difference is

511
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,679
no difference the inheritance is same for the

512
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,600
children but it's driven by a will its

513
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,200
Driven by If There Is No Will So For

514
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,240
Example: I can choose to know if you give me an ex

515
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,520
and that percentage but this discrimination

516
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,559
Against the female children is far more

517
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,200
rampant in india as compared to the

518
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,799
western countries hum

519
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,200
This will change, the next business will definitely change

520
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,480
Look at the owner I'm talking to now

521
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,520
What is happening Ranveer, this is also a reality check

522
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,720
Sad Reality But Lots of Separations from Kant

523
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,400
Divorces are happening a lot

524
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,279
So what does the business owner think that my friend

525
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,279
It may not happen in lifetime

526
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,600
Because divorces are still happening even after 20 years

527
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,039
It's still happening even after 15 years. one is this and the other

528
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,240
They say this is my daughter in many cases

529
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,159
They are not working financially for every father

530
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,080
There is a wish. I also wish that

531
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,720
friend, my daughters are financially

532
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,559
Be independent. If in a family he

533
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,360
she is staying not because her

534
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,799
She is earning her livelihood by choice. of love

535
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,840
I am living for it. living for family

536
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,520
Are. so that's why to answer your question

537
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,000
Increasingly I am seeing the fathers also

538
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,679
I am not thinking, friend. Like it was zero before

539
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,360
If you don't get married then 100% I will take care of my son

540
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,200
Not Say the Mindset Has Become 50-50 But In

541
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
there mind it is that the son has a little

542
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,600
I should get more or I am driving but

543
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,760
There should be something bigger in the daughter's name

544
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,799
There is at least one positive change in India

545
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,760
the needle has moved okay next question especially if

546
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,799
If we talk about us, there are many such businesses

547
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,279
There are families who have been doing this for five to six generations

548
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,760
We are growing our businesses. Absolutely. Wool

549
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,880
What is common among all families? So

550
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,559
Look what people have done in it.

551
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Either stay together or separate. don't interrupt

552
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,200
Hang on. So, let me give you an example.

553
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,240
The brothers are getting along well. It's love.

554
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,159
You will sacrifice your life and stay with me. having a fight

555
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,520
Is. Father will say, son, go away. means every

556
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:29,279
It is different with every generation.

557
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,799
so if you see the same brand name of mine

558
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:35,440
This brand is also owned by grandfather's brother's sons

559
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,520
Is. My grandfather's faction also belonged to that

560
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,039
This is the brand. so they may not have changed the

561
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Brand name. but they have divided the business

562
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,760
Over such a period of time. We think he is

563
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,880
There is a family. but there are various factions

564
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,720
of the family because they understood they had the

565
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,120
If you stay with the vision, utensils will ring. So

566
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,400
Brother, separate them out. no fight

567
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,200
No it is not so. Option One Option Two in Rare

568
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,159
Cases. so suppose there are four facets of the

569
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,039
Family. So maybe there won't be four parts.

570
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,559
Two people who are in love are together and

571
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,880
The two factions are different. so the trick is this

572
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,919
visualize that you can live together

573
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,880
No? I can't stay. Divide it. Separate

574
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,279
Get it done. Otherwise, drive with love.

575
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,720
what is a problem? will stay with me with love

576
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,520
Children. This is your thinking and you are thirsty for blood

577
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,840
It has happened. that is the problem but lots of

578
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,360
The Kolkata Businessman You Know

579
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,440
marwar the shekhawati region and gents you know who

580
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,400
Gone from there, they have this intelligence

581
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,640
that's not my friend it's foresight that's where they are

582
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,320
Survived Across Generations Futuristic

583
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:50,080
Futuristic is the potential problem

584
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,400
see, understand, do not deny, look

585
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,799
What happens is that a man lies the most

586
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,559
He tells himself lies

587
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,880
I don't say anything, they know it won't work brother

588
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,760
We have to run our brothers' business separately

589
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,679
do it friend hum hum

590
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,799
Now, I also want to say something

591
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,000
But I have a question for you regarding the next question.

592
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,720
I will ask you so many business families

593
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,559
If you have studied then you belong to Marwari business family and

594
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,919
What is the difference in a Gujarati business family?

595
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:21,600
yes ok people look alike from a distance

596
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,559
Are from. This is commonality in accounting

597
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,960
He is topper in Mathematics. We

598
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,919
Are financially prudent. Lifestyle

599
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,000
It is exactly like beans. Looks like a bean.

600
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,679
But there are big differences. so i will say

601
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,399
That Marwari businessmen are more methodical.

602
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,760
As is the system. That was taken out by Birlaz

603
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,600
Is. It means brother when he goes home in the evening

604
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,360
Tell me what came in. Auntie is in

605
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,440
My. Ok? so they are much more methodical,

606
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:56,240
Much more systematic. Gujaratis on the other

607
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:59,120
Hands are I think more liberal more acceptable.

608
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,880
The second difference is Marwaris are very very

609
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,919
Traditional, Very Hierarchical Gujarati Eye

610
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,600
Find a slightly more liberal one and I think

611
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,480
this is my guess because when i see almost

612
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,960
every gujarati family has somebody in

613
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,200
Atlanta and That Region of America. so there

614
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,760
is there a lot of westernization

615
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,240
Were s Marwari people it is not like that

616
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,120
The kids are not out but they have a lot of business

617
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,679
It is limited to India only. so this is these are

618
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,960
sum of the differences gujarati i find more

619
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:34,399
Liberals Have a More Broad Minded Risk Appetite

620
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,120
It is in both. and methodical I think

621
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,279
Yes, there are a few more Marwari people. Hmm

622
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Hmm. A is a super power which I have learnt in Gujarat

623
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,120
Notice has been made in business families and

624
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,799
Notice in honestly every Gujarati household

625
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,840
I have done it. My mother is also Gujarati. I slept

626
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:53,120
Seen it up close. Ok. the super power is

627
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,559
Gujarati women are fantastic at running

628
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,640
Families are as well as running businesses. and this

629
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,640
I have always noticed that even if there are

630
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,799
Not actively taking part in the business.

631
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,200
They guide their husbands in detail

632
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,120
Are. If the marriage is lasting. that's the

633
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,520
Another angle. but i think at least in my eyes

634
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,880
When it comes to Gujarati business families

635
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,880
The female head who is the matriarch of the family

636
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,640
they always have a role to play a little bit in

637
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,720
I have noticed this business. I don't know

638
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,720
about this is amazing thing and there for

639
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
my hypothesis this is just from

640
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Observations that Gujaratis I find more

641
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,200
liberal more broad minded may be it is

642
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,640
coming from there that women have a role to

643
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,799
Play and I personally think it's a good thing

644
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,919
because you see this they say lonely at the

645
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,320
Top

646
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,799
To whom can a business owner go to narrate his complaint?

647
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,960
Cried? Whom should I tell my pain to? To the Employee

648
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,080
He will manipulate it. so if your life

649
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,760
partner is someone with whom you can share your

650
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,000
Pen and She Can Add Value in Giving Your

651
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,840
Perspective like you talked about your mother.

652
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and i think may be this is one of the

653
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,520
Secrets of Being a Gujarati Business Woman

654
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,399
So successful. Hmm.

655
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,600
A honestly sir right now my business career is

656
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,200
Almost 10 years have passed. a if i

657
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,159
want to get romantically involved with

658
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,399
Anyway this is one of my conditions. i should

659
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,000
Be able to talk work with the person. Very

660
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,559
This is necessary. ok amazing. Either and I

661
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,520
genuinely feel that

662
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,799
Women around the world have a very strong strategy

663
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Makes it. The Great Strategies. I slept

664
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,240
Also agree with that. So So The Culture Which

665
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,600
I Come From Not From My Family Side But

666
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,399
from my the corporation i work for office

667
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,600
That nothing will happen at home. Ok? But

668
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,919
Recently when this covid came work from home

669
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,120
So obviously I told you a few things

670
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,880
She gives it to me. You know but I agree with you.

671
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,120
I think there is a sense of people

672
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,120
It is very sharp. and sometimes there is no

673
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,880
Logic it's just pure intuition. If

674
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,840
He said that the guy is not well

675
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,000
You will get to know about it somewhere after 5-7 years.

676
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,000
Let's go or after 20 years that he was not right. So

677
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,200
I agree with the one is intuition and I

678
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,279
also think the way they look at things and the

679
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,679
Those guys look at things that are very, very scary

680
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,919
Different. Our parameters are different. So

681
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,559
I think it's a good strategy that you are

682
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,960
having that both may be you bring them both

683
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,120
Bring complementary things to the table.

684
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,600
And it's wonderful. Hmm.

685
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,120
Do You Think Great Marriages Can Lead To

686
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,720
Great businesses? I think so. but but

687
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,519
Ranveer, I always say this in my life

688
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,559
If you want to bring a partner into the business then

689
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,799
This is walking on the razor’s edge. Ok. Failure

690
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,120
The chances are high. We are my own

691
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,840
There is a view. I have a lot of data. if you say it

692
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,399
I will tell you as well. If there is success then it will be super

693
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,360
It will be successful. But it's walking on the razors

694
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,200
Edge. Don't ever think that we have so much

695
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,640
If there is love and understanding then in business

696
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,360
It will work. Chances of conflict are high. But

697
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,320
If You Can Crack the Code and Set Some

698
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,960
Protocols I think it can be a great

699
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,840
Combination. we know you let's take

700
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,480
The case of biotech. Is it okay? let's take the

701
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,039
Piramal Family. you know nandini piramal and

702
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,600
Peter. you know so there are so many cases that

703
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,120
In which husband wife combination have really

704
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,720
Work but it is a bit difficult according to me

705
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,960
I think so flatization flatization is necessary

706
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,200
First you must understand what I am saying

707
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,720
I'm putting a big disclaimer like this

708
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,399
There is no disclaimer which I haven't read

709
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,159
This is a little bit bold and high that

710
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:33,679
should husband and wife work together

711
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,480
This is my view, if there is synergy then let us give it

712
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,919
can work but assume that

713
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,039
Conflict zones will come which can even

714
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,080
Destroy your personal relationship. so if you

715
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,720
Call it out at the beginning and tell me friend

716
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,120
will come and for that you have already become proactive

717
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,880
If you take action then the chances are mitigated.

718
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,559
But on which assumption are you working

719
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,120
yes? Like I said earlier, kids

720
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,640
Love will remain. our love will be forever.

721
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,679
No. So then it can work. Ok. next question

722
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,960
It is interesting. Are spoiled kids too

723
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,159
Businesses can grow. of the spoilt

724
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,800
The definition depends on this. if you

725
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,760
You can come to the office, board meeting

726
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,159
You can attend without giving it away then

727
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,760
You can drive it.

728
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,919
or i'm saying that if you're spoiled and

729
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,159
As I looked at that spoilt thing,

730
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,399
He said it is an iron wall. Brother whatever i do

731
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,159
In my personal time I drive Tanu's car

732
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,320
I drive, I do this, I do that.

733
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,119
But if I show up in a board meeting and I

734
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,720
Sleep off. and if i'm distracted or

735
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,520
Topic A is happening, B is happening. like this also

736
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,919
I have seen the cases. than better to stay

737
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,720
Professionalize the business. does that

738
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,760
Answer the question? Or another question. Under

739
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,119
What conditions should you stay out of business?

740
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,399
If you are not interested, you feel suffocated

741
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:58,400
it is, you don't feel like it and there is something else in you

742
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,040
You have the fire to do it, don't get into business at all.

743
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,240
Professionalize it. System, process

744
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,119
There are plenty of good templates available. and enough

745
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,520
and more examples are that only blood

746
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,960
I can't drive it. Someone else can also drive it.

747
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,200
Don't come at all. You will live a life of suffocation and mortification.

748
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,920
You are ruining your business as well.

749
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,680
You are not doing any favor to anybody.

750
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,320
Ok. So that more Indians know the truth about India.

751
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,560
So I would ask you this question: What is the problem in Delhi?

752
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,960
What is the difference between the rich and the rich of Mumbai

753
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,160
It happens?

754
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,880
This is a touchy question. So the rich in Delhi are not that rich

755
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,760
Will be loud. There will be some carts, some

756
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,400
There will be some show off, show off to the girls,

757
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,720
To impress, Bombay's Rise is a little sale

758
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,040
Will be. They will also have a long car. but the

759
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,920
Music will not be blaring with the you know

760
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,920
Mirrors down. If they go to a high end

761
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,079
Restaurants, they won't be bosses.

762
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,480
and i have seen in mumbai you no like there

763
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,720
are some places you would also know where

764
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,200
Leave the table, you don't get a seat during the weekend

765
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,079
they look this section is reserved for me that's

766
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,520
They have to show off but they will not make a ruckus

767
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,720
Gulla so the rich of Delhi will exploit and

768
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,960
Let's see brother, did I see this or not

769
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,760
I shouted that I came in such a big car

770
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,160
Bombay wala is self contained in himself you

771
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,079
no theek hai and he will not be so loud and

772
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,079
he is not you know peeping that someone saw

773
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,839
Or no, it's my car, so that's the difference.

774
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,320
It's a big cultural difference between Delhi

775
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,040
And Mumbai. But no business oriented

776
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,200
Are there differences? There is a lot of difference. Very

777
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,839
There is a difference. I think Bombay is

778
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,160
There is more truth in it. I am sorry. Delhi

779
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,640
Height Working in Delhi. Truth in Bombay

780
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,680
Is too much. Bombay has a simple and straightforward language.

781
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Seth, this won't be possible. A little in Delhi

782
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,640
Over promise and under delivery. Bombay

783
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,400
I Will Not Say Under Promise and Over

784
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,599
It is delivered. What is delivered is what is promised

785
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,079
It appears to be the same. so i think its ethical

786
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,320
much easier to do business in bombay because

787
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,640
What you see is what you get. so i think

788
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,040
It's a very big difference. Sir another India

789
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,359
This is a centric question. And I did not start this discussion

790
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:08,320
Heard it in Mumbai. Often. a discussion this

791
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,920
that's it man it feels like tie to cities

792
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,920
There is high money potential in it. and very

793
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,160
Everybody says there is a lot of money

794
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,839
It is in tier two because spending

795
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,119
Tie to Tie Three becomes slightly less. is

796
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,680
is this true? that earning potential has higher

797
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,880
In the Interiors of India. So look at this

798
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,440
Do you know what the answer is? that of the man who

799
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,720
experience hai na it is based on

800
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,400
Expectation versus reality. now tier two

801
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,000
you expect so little from there

802
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,440
Even a little bit starts making bigger noises

803
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,760
Let's go. You get my point? Butt Carts

804
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,160
Where are they sold the most? tie to or tie

805
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,960
In the forest? Where do luxury cars sell the most?

806
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,520
Are? If 200 units are sold in Delhi, a

807
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,280
of car and if 20 are sold in Indore then

808
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,440
We'll see 20 more of those. Because I

809
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,720
I am expecting 10 from there. so that

810
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,760
is one thing tier one still has more money but

811
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,480
Yes the wealth is percolating down. so five

812
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Years 10 Years Back If You See The One You Know

813
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,000
Luxury Car Network and Dealership Consumers

814
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,800
Durable Network and Luxury Brands

815
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Network It Wasn't There So Much. so fancy

816
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,160
Showrooms were not in Tier 2 and Tier 3. Today

817
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,880
They are becoming viable. but to se ki tie to me

818
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,000
More potential of growth naturally

819
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,640
because the denominator is less. If we are a

820
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,160
The lower the denominator of the thing the lower the saturation

821
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,280
If it happens then the potential is high. But Age Of

822
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,520
today tie one is definitely larger and a

823
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,119
Bigger market than tier two and tier three. Ok

824
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:43,680
Sir. One last question from Electricity MBA. Question

825
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,960
that a lot of judges get multi million

826
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,560
Dollar careers needed. Butt a little

827
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,800
A reality check is also needed. a please shed

828
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,280
Light on the time required and please tell

829
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,119
What things need to be sacrificed

830
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,200
In the pursuit of making multi-millions

831
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,720
Dollar Businesses. so only one is mine

832
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,839
This is the advice to JG because I also say in some

833
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,560
of the startup contests that they

834
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,640
It seems that this is how things happen because

835
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,680
The media is probably not trying to tell you

836
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,599
them this so one i want to tell them hard work

837
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,960
number one has to be done, number two will be a failure

838
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,760
number three will have to be pivoted many times

839
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,760
Your so called world changing idea

840
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,440
it may be that it changes four times and some

841
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,560
And it becomes number four, whatever you say

842
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,599
I am saying that there is quick money, become a billionaire quickly

843
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,839
You will go, he is misleading you. there can

844
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:43,200
B C An exception cannot be the rule

845
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,960
One gets a salary of Rs 1 crore in IIT.

846
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,680
again

847
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,320
Statistics are fooling us. so i want

848
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,200
To tell them you will have to be patient, even if you lose

849
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,079
It will happen, blood will come out, injury will happen, hurt

850
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,960
There will be challenges, your self concept will also be challenged.

851
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,800
That's part of the journey. us and that's

852
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,200
what i see you know whatever genji i

853
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,599
interact with three or four failures

854
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,240
Neither do they become big and they tell anyone

855
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,760
I am unable to even express my pain. you know i can

856
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,079
See that they are feeling lost inside. give and take

857
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,320
Not feeling confident. wherever i went

858
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,839
Up. He became a multi-millionaire. How many buns

859
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,480
Are you gone brother? We should have patience. no hurry up work

860
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,680
Not there. And remove the fear from your mind and heart

861
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,640
Remove the judgement. be absolutely shameless

862
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,280
what's the hurry what's the hurry

863
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,920
Dear, we must become 30 multi

864
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,640
You have to make a million in 30 years, you can make it in 40 years

865
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,040
Hum you know I mean there is so much pressure

866
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,359
Unnecessary has been created and Ranveer

867
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,079
I think through your this forum I want to say

868
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,960
That I used to think that in our generation

869
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,760
There is a big competition but I think Judge's

870
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,880
There is pressure and it's not merely because of

871
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,520
Instagram pictures you know that's one piece but

872
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,640
it's also about and it's not about

873
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,760
jealousy it's about what did i do wrong

874

876
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,520
Everyone's journey is different, everyone's path is different

It is different, apply all the factors friend, only then

perfect. Ok. actually practical

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,839
Beginning of chapters. a again this has to be

904
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The Most Value Adding Podcast of the Year.

905
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,480
Sir. So in chapter one we'll talk about

906
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,200
Personalized Personal Finance Strategies

907
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,119
about. These are two perspectives. First

908
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,920
Perspective for Someone Completely Self

909
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,880
Med. A person whose family doesn't have money,

910
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,000
What should be done? Second Perspective Joe

911
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,200
people are inheriting a little bit of their

912
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,040
From the family. Explain this also. Look at what exactly

913
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,560
There is no family backing. And I Assume

914
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,280
I am talking about your business family

915
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,160
Are you staying with someone or working?

916
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,079
in the first case or job of a job holder

917
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,599
of that one. So what I am saying is that the most

918
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:07,440
Firstly, the job holder has to see to it that

919
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,960
If even before AI comes in today’s time

920
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,119
Such a time will surely come when six to eight months or

921
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,160
year if both of you are working if you are

922
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,280
Married you know one person will not have a job and such

923
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,760
It is also possible that it may not be for two. so start

924
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,359
Saving for the Rainy Day. thats point number

925
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,680
Forest. Point number two is that we have a

926
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:31,040
It has become a tradition. There must be a home. Home

927
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,240
Buy it quickly. so the people who have been

928
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,079
Be successful in their jobs you know one

929
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,000
There is a resolution that the house should be ready for retirement

930
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,720
I will make it later. Throw me to Kolkata

931
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,200
Throw it to Aurangabad and I will go. so build a house

932
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,280
That you should not hurry so much. If you have to make

933
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,800
yes you should be flexible to live in a

934
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,760
Rented Accommodation. The third thing is that

935
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,280
Diversify Your Portfolio. if somebody is

936
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Telling You Take a Portfolio PMS

937
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:03,040
But use mutual fund, use PMS

938
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,880
Various Things to Keep on Growing Your You

939
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:10,480
no portfolio and the most important thing is this

940
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,240
Have a target in mind and get it somewhere

941
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,280
Document it because it is a moving goal

942
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,640
post that dude this is my net worth

943
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,319
If this happens then I will feel secure in

944
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:26,240
Life hum hmm. it is a continual

945
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:29,520
Moving goal posts. How Ever Build Inflation

946
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:32,640
Into it. Because what happens when Ranveer

947
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,680
He keeps moving, so you keep yourself moving

948
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,599
Then you are harsh on yourself. because dude

949
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,240
My net worth is this much, his is this much. So

950
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,640
these are the things i think very well for

951
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,680
Personal Finance Point of View. We are ok.

952
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,440
I would like to add a couple of points. the point

953
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,319
I don't want to add what you already added

954
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,319
Is PMS firms. Nobody tells us this

955
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,480
that a portfolio management service is called

956
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,480
There is one thing. Everybody thinks so, friend

957
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,359
How do I do personal finance? I

958
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,920
Don't even know it. my suggestion is pms

959
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,560
Find firms and work with them and targets

960
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,800
Working with them early. The different PMS

961
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,400
Lower thresholds vary across firms

962
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,800
There are. That is, how much money is the minimum

963
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,040
Have to invest. So find a good one

964
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,599
Which you can fit into. and this data is

965
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,480
Easily available. It's published data. We are you

966
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,319
Can these be PMS providers?

967
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,280
What is the last three years Cager? Five

968
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,440
What is Ears Cagger? 10 years, seven years

969
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,520
What are the kinds of risk capital you know

970
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,920
What type of portfolio do they do? So

971
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,240
PMS is very important. Butt PMS

972
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,800
Requires a Certain Minimum Capital You Know

973
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,040
it's 50 lax before you can get into one

974
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,040
PMS. I think something like new age PMS

975
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,359
Firms where threshold is Rs 10 lakh

976
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,440
Is. Fine. So I am not aware of that. But

977
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,240
if you have it I'm saying this if you have it

978
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,119
There is a good PMS, that's a very good way

979
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,440
to really increase your wealth because of the way

980
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,920
The Market Has Been in the Last Few Years

981
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,200
and is likely to be in the fourth coming

982
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,760
Time you know apart from your salaried income

983
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:04,079
If you do it right then this can really

984
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,319
Be a good wealth creation engine for you

985
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,560
because it is important for the one who did not inherit

986
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,119
Isn't it true that we are talking about insecurity?

987
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,680
That fear is always there, so make a target

988
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,400
And achieve it. It took 5 years, it took 10 years.

989
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,280
But consciously you have to make it happen. We

990
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,520
we second point i would like to add is yaar

991
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,480
Live within your means.

992
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,160
Especially in your 20s, the Instagram affair

993
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,040
I do not spend money on YouTube

994
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,839
More than you need to spend. infact

995
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,560
Savings are cool and it will make your life

996
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,960
Much cool on your 30s. So live a little under

997
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,520
Your meals. so i am very simple about it

998
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,040
That you know it's a crude way of saying it. You

999
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,359
On whose strength are you dancing? You are spending,

1000
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,000
Mummy and Daddy are giving it and it is limitless

1001
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,839
do it. Brother you are wasting your own money and

1002
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
If you are not saving then why are you

1003
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,880
Shooting Yourself in the Foot. and you don't

1004
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,760
Have a security net. means that you to another

1005
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,240
Bleak your own future to show

1006
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,520
had been. So security net is variant.

1007
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,640
hmm so as you would no lot of people go and

1008
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,319
Work in Africa, some people go to the Middle East

1009
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,400
But now you know in the Middle East the cost of

1010
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,800
Living has gone up so I see a lot of my

1011
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,280
friends they go to you know they have a

1012
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,359
The Hardship They Go Without to Create a Family

1013
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,520
that safety net we're talking about that

1014
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,480
If I am not inheriting then brother safety net

1015
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:29,440
do what you have to do for it is very important

1016
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:32,640
We have a final point I would like to add is one

1017
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,040
There is another thing which I think to some degree

1018
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,680
You are taught this in school. Butt often

1019
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,960
I have observed that finance strategy

1020
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,760
The YouTube channels do not teach that

1021
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,000
Also focus on attacking game. That means the income

1022
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Focus a little on increasing it. now weather you

1023
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,560
Are you doing it in one job and through multiple

1024
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,200
There should be some aggression in income sources

1025
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,520
Needed You should think about your own career

1026
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,200
How do I multiply this? do i get

1027
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,960
Promoted to the next degree. how do i

1028
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,040
Get promoted in that case? so i am fully

1029
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,280
agree with sea today what has happened is

1030
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,520
That's there two types of jobs. Some Jobs

1031
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,119
There are some things which can extract you so much.

1032
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,440
They take it. At least the kind of companies are

1033
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,079
Work for Even to Go and Give a Guest

1034
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,400
Lecture wasn't possible. but i think now

1035
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,359
Companies are realizing this work life

1036
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,760
Balance piece. so if we have a passion we end

1037
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,359
you can slowly go without conflict

1038
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,240
Interest with your company. we are not moon

1039
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,720
Lighting. I started my company in 45 hours

1040
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,359
But it was weak. after that whatever time I have

1041
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,680
Bacha I fully agree with you that out of that

1042
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,400
also you should you should be aggressive too

1043
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:38,240
INCREASE YOUR TOP LINE We ​​want that and that

1044
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,480
When will the target be achieved? I have to achieve it bhaiya

1045
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,280
and for this I will do everything put in the

1046
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,559
Extra House Exactly Exactly That

1047
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,079
Do you want or need this whole YouTube career?

1048
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,440
I am self made, I did not take money from anyone

1049
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:55,119
Parents also did not provide funds for age 22 to 24

1050
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,040
Tak a I worked as a trainer and specially

1051
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,800
On weekends. When the weekends were free I

1052
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,800
He used to fill all the slots. and i would

1053
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,760
earn that extra money but it gave me a

1054
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,720
Cushion for my YouTube channel. so that at least

1055
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,119
Between 22 and 27-28 that aggression will happen

1056
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,880
I need a little. so you know this is very good

1057
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,480
You stated the point. one of me

1058
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,880
Took an interview a few days ago. Asked

1059
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,280
Dude work life balance. I said I did

1060
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,680
I never thought about it. If you work life

1061
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,480
Balance you are thinking that I will stay longer than this

1062
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:25,599
If I don't give it then change your job. That means that you

1063
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,240
I am not in the right job. second thing if you

1064
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,480
I am not getting juice in my job, I am not getting juice

1065
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,760
it is, juice is the right word you know which is ours

1066
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,720
If I am not getting Rasa then Bhaiya I have a day job

1067
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,800
then do something else on the weekend but this

1068
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,960
It is absolutely correct that you should increase your income

1069
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,880
It is very important when I was growing up.

1070
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,280
don't know if it is right or wrong so they

1071
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,800
What is the difference between Told me Bunny and Punjabi

1072
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,559
Punjabis believe that God has increased my expenses

1073
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,720
If you increase your expenses then you will automatically generate income

1074
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:58,800
I will run but I don't know if it is true or not

1075
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:02,800
But I 100% agree with this, do it a little

1076
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,440
Friend, bring passion and do it, you know we

1077
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,200
swing the bat really hard wali r young yes

1078
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,280
Absolutely okay right now I think we've wrapped

1079
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,240
Up the Topic About Personal Finance for Someone

1080
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,079
Who is self-made? Those who inherit money

1081
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,559
are inheriting the property

1082
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:23,760
I would like to bracket these separately.

1083
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:27,839
In the layers of A capital, suppose that someone

1084
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,480
has a capital of Rs 1 lakh. Someone has

1085
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,559
One person has a capital of Rs 10 lakh. Any 

1086
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,760
has a capital of Rs 1 crore. Someone has

1087
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,720
There is a capital of Rs 10 crore. Now tell me Sir Four

1088
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,520
Categories: How is the game of personal finance now?

1089
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,920
should I play? so when we say this

1090
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,280
inherited it i.e. my father

1091
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,079
He gave me the cheque. That would never happen

1092
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,680
because he is giving you a gift or he

1093
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,079
Giving you money for investment

1094
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,400
Are. Both things are different. you get my

1095
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,800
Point? this inheritance

1096
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:04,000
is a seed money for you to make a business and

1097
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,240
This is seed money to grow the wealth. if it is

1098
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,319
Seed Money to Grow the Wealth. That means a gift

1099
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,800
Did. I gave my child ₹1 on his birthday

1100
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:14,240
Gave Rs 10 crore. in most cases

1101
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,200
Only the parents will decide. but if it is

1102
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:20,240
As a seed money for your business for your

1103
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,839
passionate idea so I will say this to him

1104
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:26,720
taking capital and doing what you want

1105
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,880
Make a three year business plan. so i

1106
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,920
I am saying that

1107
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,119
Whatever I learnt in business, I also learnt it in Reliance

1108
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:39,040
And many other brothers are from Gujarati community

1109
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:42,160
There are 300 days in a year. Ok? They

1110
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,839
It is said that 1000 days are also calculated as 365 days.

1111
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,839
Invest ₹1 in this for 1000 days

1112
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:53,200
I will not take it out

1113
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:56,240
1000, if you have to deposit ₹1 in one day then it will be closed

1114
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,800
are you getting the drift so I have ₹1

1115
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,880
There are lakhs. I made a business plan and

1116
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,000
I have ₹1 crore and I have a business plan

1117
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,319
Made. The principal is same in both. This 

1118
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,640
I won't ask for ₹1 extra within the range

1119
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,760
From mom and dad. In this the business

1120
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,960
I will drive it. From this, for your household expenses

1121
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:18,800
I will not take out anything. with in 1000 days it

1122
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:22,640
Should generate cash it should be cash positive. We

1123
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,960
If After 1000 Days I Still Need to If I

1124
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,160
I'm in a negative cash flow and this is to me

1125
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,880
If you want more money, close the business. We

1126
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:33,839
It's a very simple funda. This is not 1 lakh today

1127
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:37,119
Is. Papa, give me 10,000 more. Give me 20,000 more

1128
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:39,760
Give. There is no such business because we

1129
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,000
you should know that i have got capital

1130
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,800
I have to walk in that only. Basically 3 years

1131
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,480
This is the timeline of. Ok? and that initial

1132
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,640
by doing something with the capital initially

1133
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,800
Maybe by spending 10,000 maybe 1 lakh

1134
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,119
If you have Rs 1 crore by spending.

1135
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,720
Basically a percentage of that income. Maybe

1136
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,640
Between 1 to 10% Play with it and try

1137
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,000
Figuring out how to make it profitable

1138
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,000
Make it. gives a practical example

1139
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,920
Am. A lot of people are very upset that

1140
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,359
Let's open a restaurant. Are we okay? We

1141
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,599
So I ask brother in the restaurant

1142
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,760
How much money will it cost? let's say i'm taking

1143
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,319
Some Arbitrary Number Interior Vitreous All

1144
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,359
Invested crores of rupees. how much is the rent?

1145
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:20,559
₹5 Lakh per month. Ok. I am so much my friend

1146
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:23,119
It is nearby, I will do it. So, the one who earns ₹5 lakh per month

1147
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:27,280
Rent is Rs. 50,000 plus up to ₹ 50,000 lakh

1148
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:31,040
There are overheads. Plus whatever sale you will get

1149
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:34,640
Will there be no cash losses initially? We

1150
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,640
What is your expenditure and what is your income

1151
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,160
will it reach the break even point from

1152
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,559
First Month Know It Might Take Six Months 8

1153
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,680
Months to reach break even who will fund that

1154
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,160
Apart from Money Hundred Crore, it can be your ₹

1155
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,480
Negative cash flow of Rs. lakh per month is over

1156
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:54,079
it's you budget it for six months then you

1157
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:57,119
need ₹ crore and 18 lakhs waiting out there

1158
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,920
This is the math which many youngsters don't

1159
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,960
Understand now that by pausing slightly

1160
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,720
Jugaad thinking that okay for me is food business

1161
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,960
I have to get in. and my definition of getting

1162
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,720
I want to open this food business or a restaurant.

1163
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,440
Start a Cloud Kitchen Business Instead

1164
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,040
do it. Absolutely. If instead of that you really need to grind

1165
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,599
If you want to do it then start street food business

1166
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,680
do it. Go sell your food on the street. master

1167
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,920
The Art of Food. Or once you had food

1168
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:23,040
Once you have completed your Masters, you can run a restaurant.

1169
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,200
Exactly. and my point in this was

1170
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,920
Which is yours worth Rs 1 lakh, 10 lakh, one crore

1171
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,480
There was an example. it's again link to that

1172
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,680
Personal Finance vs Business Finance.

1173
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,079
This is the basic funda of business finance. Yours

1174
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,800
What is the capital expenditure? Capex

1175
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:42,000
How much is it? How much is the OPEX? Monthly Expenses

1176
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,400
How much is it? What is the break even point? And

1177
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,280
to reach that break even point

1178
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,760
How much total fund do I need? So upfront

1179
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,240
Investment Plus the Negative Cash Flows

1180
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,440
Till you reach break even point is the money that

1181
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,599
You should have. We should have this funda. No

1182
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,280
Then after a few days you will take the bowl again

1183
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,359
You will come to your father after getting scolded and this

1184
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,280
No, what you are saying is very common.

1185
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:09,200
Overspending the Capital Etcetera

1186
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,119
But why does this overspending happen?

1187
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,599
Overspending on an actual human level

1188
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:17,920
Why does it happen? Look, you have two things.

1189
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,000
The forecasting was wrong because and it of course

1190
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,800
happens because you have never worked hard with it

1191
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,520
Bosses, the type of bosses we worked with

1192
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,319
Did you give the forecast? If you gave it then

1193
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,359
Firstly 20 questions will be asked. what is the basis

1194
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:33,440
Is? What is an Assumption Sheet? What is a term sheet?

1195
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,280
What have you assumed interest rate?

1196
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,240
what have you assumed about you know

1197
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,280
Inflation rate? so there is an assumption sheet

1198
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,520
Based on which you make a forecast and then

1199
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,680
This will happen to you. Not like this one day I

1200
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,839
I did it while sitting. so this is one

1201
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,000
The reason why it's going wrong is one thing that's wrong

1202
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,319
Forecast. it is not necessary

1203
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,559
Overspending. it is you have to forecast

1204
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,960
I don't know it because I haven't learnt it from anyone

1205
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,359
has taught so first of all we

1206
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,400
I will teach forecasting. without him anything

1207
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:08,160
Cannot be done. the second point is if you

1208
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,960
You are going over budget, how are you going brother?

1209
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:14,400
Was there no month wise budget? who is authorized

1210
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,000
You too go over the budget. hum if you are going

1211
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,160
Over the budget. this there has to be a

1212
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,040
Justification.

1213
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,599
Like I was handling x amount of late

1214
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,200
to Rs 850 crore from advertising and sales

1215
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:29,839
Promotion Budget in a Year If I Divide it Month Wise

1216
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,160
I have broken it, if mine this month

1217
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,160
I have 20 crores and I am doing 22, so I

1218
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,079
I will have to tell my boss sir 2 crores

1219
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,559
That's why I'm spending extra and this is me

1220
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:41,599
This is how I will recover. Are you getting the point?

1221
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,480
This is the sense that's why I am just jumping

1222
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:47,520
Getting into business is fine but understanding this

1223
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,400
Very Basic Principles of Cash Management

1224
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,359
Management is very important. We are overspending

1225
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,520
How did it happen brother? There was no budget system. We

1226
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,240
Why a system of plan vs actual

1227
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,240
Wasn't it? So why start a business?

1228
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,960
which is why i think its very important that

1229
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,680
At the beginning of a business person's career

1230
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,400
Working together is essential. Absolutely. Learn

1231
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:11,839
Understand how organizations are run.

1232
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,319
And if business is from a family then from childhood

1233
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:17,119
You must have learnt it. But it can also be like this

1234
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:19,920
That your parents are not in business. they have

1235
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:23,440
Been in the job and you're starting out but

1236
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:26,240
The Fundamental Building Blocks What I

1237
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,960
Mentioned few things break even point cash

1238
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,640
Flow management is very important. otherwise

1239
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,680
What will happen?

1240
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:38,000
What is its consequence? again we go back

1241
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:42,160
To the Psychological Thing We Worry About

1242
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,640
We should not lose our self confidence

1243
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,839
because when you go back to ask for money

1244
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,920
neither does it make you feel ashamed

1245
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,440
Nor does it destroy the man. J

1246
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,359
It happens a lot in me. very emotional

1247
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,880
He is sensitive. A little scolding in our time

1248
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,040
It would get a scratch. We sand it. Now

1249
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,079
You can't say anything. I think parents are here

1250
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:02,480
The role needs to be a bit hand holding

1251
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,480
Needed Absolutely. mild to very important

1252
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,079
Is. This is the specialty of India, that here

1253
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,400
Parents get a little involved in career

1254
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:12,319
In. At least for guidance early teaching

1255
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:14,880
etc. A ok. So I asked you 1 lakh and

1256
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:17,520
10 la vs 1 crore vs 10 crore.

1257
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,200
The principal is the same. Yes sir. Principal Beans

1258
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:25,359
Is. Ok. Ok. For now you have to do this

1259
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:27,839
I will ask questions associated with chapter A that

1260
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,480
Suppose your parents didn't give you seed capital

1261
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:33,119
has given it. Directly into your bank account

1262
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,839
They put in the money and gave us independence

1263
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:38,799
Son, do anything. Yes. Ok. 1 lakh and 10

1264
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:41,440
Lakh versus 1 crore and 10 crore. so if i

1265
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:44,400
I have only 1 lakh I will go and put it in the

1266
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,319
Best mutual funds. We are very simple. We

1267
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,200
I will not look left or right here and there. Yes

1268
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:52,160
if i have 10 la i will divide it between

1269
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,720
Mutual funds may be some other asset class

1270
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,480
it could be gold or something else but I will

1271
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:01,920
do that if i have 1 crore right after 10

1272
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,880
lax is 1 crore then i will take a pms

1273
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,160
I will take a mutual fund you know I might

1274
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:12,000
take some little bit of gold and I might

1275
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:14,480
also you know invest little bit in a

1276
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Property which is under construction

1277
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:20,480
which i know comes from a sound you know

1278
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,440
builder house i don't want to loose my shirt

1279
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,559
ok and i would do that as well so that you

1280
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,799
no i make some you no appreciation for me

1281
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,720
If I get it then I will give him three or four assets

1282
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:33,920
I will put you in class, I will not cry hey

1283
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,240
The stock market has fallen brother, the shares will fall

1284
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,839
Gold will rise

1285
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,640
It is the reverse, we have war, gold is up

1286
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:45,760
We reached the spot, so the stock fell down so hedging

1287
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,599
aren't they like us who you know

1288
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,000
It's you have to hedge at your own risk.

1289
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,400
That's what I will do. I will divide it

1290
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,839
into multiple asset classes which i am

1291
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,720
Comfortable with it but one thing is very clear.

1292
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:00,960
I will talk to three experts and use

1293
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,280
My own intelligence. Blind trust on someone

1294
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,680
I will not do it. and i'm assuming that 10

1295
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,160
1 Crore Strategy for Crore Bracket

1296
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:11,440
into 10. That is absolutely correct. 1 Crore

1297
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:16,799
Strategy into 10. Ok. Ok. Moving

1298
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:19,599
On to the next chapter. Now we will talk about 2025

1299
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:22,160
About the relevant industries of India

1300
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:25,359
Where there is high potential growth. then respect

1301
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,440
You have seed capital to start your business here

1302
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,839
What do you definitely want to do in your life?

1303
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,559
Industries should target us again

1304
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:35,920
And this means that your family business is now

1305
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:39,280
is it not us that you have to decide if

1306
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,079
my family business is it ok or not

1307
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:46,319
so i will answer first if its a family business

1308
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:48,720
so first of all i would check that

1309
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:51,119
What are the things that make me

1310
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,040
I will be disrupted. This is definitely a disruptor

1311
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,480
Will be done. i.e. self awareness

1312
01:00:53,040 --> 01:01:00,000
related to the weaknesses to the weaknesses and the

1313
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:03,040
rate of change of technology we let you know

1314
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,359
say let's say today yesterday i somebody had come

1315
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,520
Home and they are into they are big travel

1316
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:09,920
Agents. I said friend in today's time

1317
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,559
There is also a travel agent. It is said bro

1318
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,440
There is medical tourism. he doesn't trust

1319
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:17,280
I can do it online. so you get my

1320
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,400
Point. I am saying that my business

1321
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,880
in that I would see that the AI,

1322
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,760
Technology, Digitization and New

1323
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:30,160
Trends How It Will Disrupt My Business

1324
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:32,799
and i will invest that money to hedge my

1325
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,599
Risk. We are you getting the points? If

1326
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,760
I have a jewelry store or we are bhaiya

1327
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,960
Our designs are such that people stand in line to get them

1328
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,599
I don't want to do it online sir

1329
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,720
If you don't want to do it today you will have to do it tomorrow people will come

1330
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,599
We are no more Blinkit at all

1331
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,240
finished after i see it on the table

1332
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,720
has happened in my house when the sauce ran out

1333
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,319
The pakoras were served and the sauce was ready in no time

1334
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:01,760
I am gone but here so this is one

1335
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:03,680
now suppose i'm starting out a fresh

1336
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,119
diff different case right its none of my business

1337
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,240
Not there. I am a youngster. I do something

1338
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:11,760
I want. I will say this

1339
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:15,359
First it has to start with inside you

1340
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:19,119
What is the capability? It is written in our Gita

1341
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:22,400
It has happened. Is it okay? fear of another's religion

1342
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:26,559
It generates. Follow your own religion. it

1343
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:28,720
Dharma is not religion. It means your nature. We

1344
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,960
God has given every person a gift

1345
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,119
Is. I gave you a gift. it was manifested

1346
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,440
You. Right? It doesn't happen to anybody

1347
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,400
Manifest. so important is what you

1348
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,760
Can you contribute? suppose i am saying

1349
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:44,880
Biotech and biological related issues are a big deal

1350
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,960
Business Opportunity Like Anti Aging in a

1351
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,839
few years it's already happening but when

1352
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:52,400
I talk to my friends you know I don't even know

1353
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:54,799
no weather we will die at 150 or what is

1354
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,440
Going to happen. So bio is an area. AI

1355
01:02:54,799 --> 01:03:00,160
It is definitely an area. you know process

1356
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,680
Digitization is another area. so these are some

1357
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:09,040
of the emerging areas how ever it

1358
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:11,440
has got nothing to do with just potential

1359
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,839
it has to match with what you bring to the

1360
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,039
table are you getting my point

1361
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:19,200
There is no interest in AIA brother

1362
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,760
Why should I go there, I don't have a bio

1363
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,079
I am interested in what potential I will do

1364
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,000
I'm a good chef so I'll go eat

1365
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:29,839
My food is getting disrupted, brother

1366
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,880
It is a gift na hum it is my gift which God

1367
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:35,280
has given to me which I need to nurture are

1368
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,559
you are getting this gift i think a great

1369
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,480
Practice is a reflection of your own life

1370
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,559
There's a timeline and you're somewhere

1371
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,799
You've arrived and now have seed capital

1372
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:47,359
If you want to start a business then at that point

1373
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:51,440
Life experiences whatever happened before

1374
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:54,319
skill sets, courses done, studies etc.

1375
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:57,280
Scan everything and ask yourself:

1376
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:59,520
what did I find most interesting then

1377
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,599
Ask me whether I am interested in this

1378
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,160
Create a monetizable product or service

1379
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,880
can I or not? Absolutely. and if the answer

1380
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:10,720
yes begin. But there wouldn't be a triangle in it

1381
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:13,920
Is. Just interest is not enough. One

1382
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,319
There is interest. There is a potential

1383
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,920
And there is a skill set. the potential of the

1384
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:22,160
Industry of that person. Ok. I am good

1385
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,160
I will not sing today.

1386
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,000
But I love singing. so my

1387
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,079
I am interested. I don’t have the skill set.

1388
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,079
I have the potential. Some guru said

1389
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,960
that he will become a good singer. but today it's out of tune

1390
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,359
He sings. All three have to match and then

1391
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,520
Monetization has to come. so i am the answer to this

1392
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:40,799
I am giving it. Your question is very simple. Brother

1393
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:44,799
What business should I do? I am saying that this is

1394
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:47,039
You said that business locus of control has

1395
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:50,319
To be with you. which I read from the Gita

1396
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:53,440
Gave an example. Not this is Trudy. We

1397
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:56,480
The trend has got nothing to do if it doesn't

1398
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,079
Does not resonate with you. it has to be an

1399
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,359
Infatuation.

1400
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:03,520
You have to be 24 by saying in love with it. And

1401
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:07,039
If that idea hasn't occurred to you, brother.

1402
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:10,160
Get your job done quietly. we like i attended

1403
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:12,640
You know a book talk by some author. You Know. So

1404
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:15,359
this guy was asking this question that sir

1405
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,440
I want to do business, but I don't understand

1406
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:19,839
I am unable to understand what to do. So he said

1407
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,599
Son, get a job. Sir what is this answer?

1408
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,599
When a son falls in love with a girl, he says

1409
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,640
no the girl is in love with the boy

1410
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:30,559
Don't take advice. I can't live for you

1411
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:32,559
No matter how much the world opposes me, I will live

1412
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,359
With you. It is live in today's time. Our

1413
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:38,400
There is a wedding on time. That idea didn't come

1414
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:41,760
You should wait brother.

1415
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,559
It won't happen with trend. hum it is a wrong

1416
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,680
Approach to start with. let me twist a

1417
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:51,359
Question. So the big business stories would have been

1418
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:53,680
are just the beginning of those stories

1419
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,359
What happens? Ok. how know? how do you

1420
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,160
sniff out that yes this will be a good

1421
01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:00,240
Business? So look, this is a very good question.

1422
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,640
Yours. Do you know what has happened many times?

1423
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:05,359
It is accidental.

1424
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,599
which have become big businesses many times

1425
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:09,760
Just a stroke of luck or accidental.

1426
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,319
Look, you are calling it accidental. my mind

1427
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,720
I feel that this is the result of friction. Ok?

1428
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:17,839
That can also be true. Yes. means that which

1429
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,079
I got it and started from somewhere

1430
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:23,359
began. Just started trading. As

1431
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:25,440
You said get ready brother, I got three for ₹2

1432
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,079
If I sold it or got three for two then it was too much.

1433
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:31,599
Sold it for Rs. 2.25. So I started from there.

1434
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,000
So the answer to your question is look at the

1435
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,799
Trends and Look at What You Bring to the

1436
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,799
Table. his match

1437
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,760
end interest

1438
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:44,799
Capability or skill set and potential

1439
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,359
Its match and monetization then make a

1440
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:49,359
Business plan. Got it. of the next chapter

1441
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:53,119
Before I begin I would like to say that

1442
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:56,960
that I thought we would talk about something relevant

1443
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:59,680
Industries in the following chapter that these

1444
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,720
these are boring businesses sir which are the

1445
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:05,520
Actual Boring Businesses Where High

1446
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:09,119
There is potential. But because you said all this

1447
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:13,039
About finding your own rhythm before you

1448
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:15,119
Find the Business You Want to Do. A

1449
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:17,359
Let's talk about finding rhythm.

1450
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:20,640
So in the next chapter we are going to talk

1451
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:24,319
About Personal Systems That Age 22 to Assume

1452
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:26,799
What should be done till 30? Let's Map

1453
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:30,160
That's through some points. so let's begin

1454
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:34,799
The New Chapter. So what to do from 22 to 30

1455
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:36,720
Needed? yes if you want to do a job we

1456
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:39,119
Again whatever we are discussing is job

1457
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:42,079
Versus Business. Right? Yes yes. If you job

1458
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:45,440
Do you want to be successful in this country?

1459
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:49,520
For this, one will have to crack a competition. Any

1460
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:52,319
Do one after 12th, IIT

1461
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,720
do it, do medical, do it after graduation

1462
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:57,520
Take. You know you get my point. so you have to

1463
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,640
From cracking UPSC, from CA to U

1464
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,160
Have to crack one competition to do well in a

1465
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,680
Job. Like a competitive exam.

1466
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,359
Competitive exam. it can be anyone

1467
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,680
Competitive. I am saying it could be for a

1468
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:10,319
Job and n Education. I suppose you crack

1469
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,400
IIT, u crack IM and u crack CA and

1470
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,319
you crack medical and architecture and there

1471
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,799
so many other things the nift there is

1472
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:19,199
NID THERE IS LAW. At first, only

1473
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:22,400
The engineer was a doctor. There are many. One

1474
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:24,640
I will have to crack the exam brother. and steve

1475
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:28,719
The story of jobs and college dropouts

1476
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:30,960
Right, delete it. This is the most ruined

1477
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:33,359
These are kids who drop out of college

1478
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,880
it's syndrome again you're taking an

1479
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:39,040
Outlier exception s the rule.

1480
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:42,159
An outlier and exception cannot be the

1481
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:46,640
Rule brother. Or so that's my first point.

1482
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:49,679
Get your education base right. have this much muscle

1483
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,640
power that even if I don't do business

1484
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,480
Will live a lifestyle as good and as near as possible

1485
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,199
Good as a middle scale businessman. Dude I

1486
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:00,319
I would also like to say one small thing. please 32

1487
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:02,319
A Fairly Young As A Business Owner. I have this

1488
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,480
I noticed that teammates who had education

1489
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,279
Haven't completed vs. teammates

1490
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:11,279
has completed education it is always the

1491
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:13,839
once I completed the education which was done by grinding and

1492
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,759
We can do more. they don't let go of the

1493
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:18,560
Ball When the Ball Becomes Difficult to Because

1494
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:20,640
They had the religion power. Yes. that one

1495
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,520
Education builds resilience

1496
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,159
By completing it. choose a course you enjoy but

1497
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,319
Get it complete. don't be in the zone of

1498
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:30,960
Dropping out. That's my personal opinion.

1499
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,279
Very Rarely Drop Out Success Stories

1500
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,679
They happen in India. Even as a young person,

1501
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,839
I am very against this concept of

1502
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,520
Dropping out. And my risk appetite

1503
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,359
It is very big. Still, I am saying this.

1504
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,600
Based on what we have seen over the last 10

1505
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:47,040
Years. Now please go answer. Ok? So

1506
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:50,400
First thing is, you are doing a job. consider yourself worthy of this

1507

01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,320
Decent lifestyle. almost as good as a

Middle scale business. I'm not a big

1510
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:00,480
Industrist. Seconds, get down to business.

1511
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:03,280

01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,239
Then happy to give there time. we this is the

1558
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,800
The Only Way We Can Give Back to Society How Much

1559
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:11,360
We have got it. hmm so finding mentors is a big deal

1560
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,120
It is necessary. It will take hard work. and important thing

1561
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,760
This is someone who has never done business with you

1562
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,360
Get business advice. and who ever got a job

1563
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,239
You did not do that, you are taking job advice from him

1564
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:23,120
yes. So, the problem is within you. Pick the Right

1565
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:25,520
Mentor. you get my point or you go to surgery

1566
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,400
If you are not going to get it done by an engineer then right

1567
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,960
Grab a mentor and go proactively

1568
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,360
people will be happy to give time ok

1569
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,920
Moving On To Chapter Four Let's Talk About

1570
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,840
Relevant Industries as stated in India

1571
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,800
It is said that boring businesses make the most

1572
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,239
Money because this is a bit of a family business

1573
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,320
It is special. Right?

1574
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,719
I have noticed that family businesses are in

1575
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:49,679
Flourish in boring domains. Fair

1576
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:54,159
Two is absolutely fine. So boring India

1577
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:56,080
What are the business sectors? Look, tell me this

1578
01:12:54,159 --> 01:13:00,400
Let's start from the beginning and talk about today.

1579
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,840
Sure, the sectors which are booming today

1580
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,560
have been. Let's say if we go a little bit earlier

1581
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:07,679
If we go then it will be much easier. Auto Auto

1582
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,560
components related if you look at the way the

1583
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:14,320
Companies have become multi-billion dollar

1584
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,159
Enterprises I mean before liberalisation

1585
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:19,360
you know what kind of cars we had in this

1586
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:22,159
country right so one is anything to do with

1587
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:25,840
Manufacturing with in manufacturing

1588
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:29,440
Auto Kind of Almost Like a Torch Bearer

1589
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:33,280
you know because liberalization happened in 91

1590
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:36,320
Later in 93, 94, 95, Honda, General Motors, all these

1591
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:40,800
Applied for it. At that time, people who auto

1592
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:43,760
The way they became components

1593
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:46,960
Multi Billion

1594
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:49,840
Dollar Enterprises. this is a paradigm i

1595
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,159
M Giving. Now he is not there today. Because we

1596
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,440
R Moving Towards EV. Today Auto Components

1597
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:55,440
You don't have to put any money in it at all.

1598
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,719
Components will not be saved. the engine is going

1599
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Is. Hum there is no IC engine. now what

1600
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:04,719
Is the way renewable energy.

1601
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:08,320
Anything to do with renewable energy is a

1602
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:10,880
Sector to be in and get associated with any

1603
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:14,080
way right that is one area i will say

1604
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:17,199
definitely look at okay it could be wind it

1605
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:20,880
could be solar you know it could be hydro so

1606
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:25,280
Renewable energy is a variant to anything

1607
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:28,719
And everything to do with ESG

1608
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:32,560
Environment Environment Sustainability &

1609
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:36,159
Governance ESG G related anything you

1610
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,480
You will because ESG is no longer a choice.

1611
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:40,880
There are mandates that if I have goods from you

1612
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:44,320
If you want to buy then you must have these compliances

1613
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:47,120
Needed So ESG related is a very big deal

1614
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:50,400
business which if somebody can crack the court

1615
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:54,080
Can make multi billion dollars. We are seconds

1616
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:58,800
third is you know related to again it's a

1617
01:14:54,080 --> 01:15:01,040
Kind of an offshoot of ESG safety. First

1618
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:04,400
We didn't think that much. Wearing gloves,

1619
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:07,280
I am wearing a helmet. this employee safety, worker

1620
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,360
Safety has become a big industry and a

1621
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,840
Big Business to Sensitize Specially

1622
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:13,840
MSMEs. Where everything happens. Minimum Wages

1623
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,520
Even though I am not giving it, it is still going on. I Mean

1624
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,280
you know i have heard there are so many

1625
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,440
Factories. Their sources of competition

1626
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:22,640
The advantage is that he is not paying minimum wages

1627
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:25,360
Am. Imagine. So safety. Next I Will

1628
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:28,239
say is anything and everything to do with

1629
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:31,760
Artificial Intelligence and Digitization.

1630
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:36,480
And last is anything and everything to do

1631
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:39,600
With Bio and Pharmacy. Bio means bio

1632
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,560
Means the new developments that are taking place in

1633
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:46,800
The field of biology like anti-aging is

1634
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:49,600
One right disease is another one health related

1635
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:52,560
Stuff is another one. so much of research is

1636
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:56,159
Happening at the Frontiers

1637
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:58,239
Intersection of Bio with Even Physics. You

1638
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:02,000
no so i think there is a lot of development

1639
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:05,679
Happening there that is an area and pharma

1640
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,480
is there again something which i feel is continuing

1641
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,400
it will evolve there might be some disruption

1642
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:13,120
But it's going to be there for a long time

1643
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:15,920
time so the four five sectors are which i

1644
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,880
feel you know the end of course the last one i should

1645
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,000
Ad Which is an offshoot of What I Said

1646
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:25,520
Renewable Energy I Wood Say Anything

1647
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:29,520
Related to with energy because kiss will run

1648
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:31,600
on which one will we go and on which one is it okay

1649
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,920
Traditionally it is manufacturing

1650
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,679
Traditionally it has been manufactured but

1651
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:39,760
I'm saying manufacturing is back again

1652
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:42,719
boring but any of these areas also will

1653
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:45,920
Gel Well With This Generation

1654
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,719
write it will not be as boring but it

1655
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,760
also has a lot of potential got it. So

1656
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:55,840
Study these sectors and invest

1657
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:58,000
and get in through the easiest and the lowest

1658
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,080
Denomination Route in Terms of Investment

1659
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,760
end risk. Ok? talking about this

1660
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:05,760
Are. Let's go deeper. Ok? two additional questions

1661
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,000
Is. The first question is that these five-six

1662
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:12,239
How to bring profitability in industries?

1663
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,080
I think that's the main question. anyone should

1664
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:17,679
ask themself before thinking about

1665
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:22,400
Starting business. The second question is the game

1666
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:25,920
plan because not all these sectors

1667
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:28,800
I seem larger than life as a 22 year old

1668
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,440
How do I suddenly install a solar panel in an old graduate?

1669
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:35,440
How do I understand this, look I have seen it

1670
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:38,800
many people who started with solar

1671
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,960
Started with installation, now solar

1672
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,600
I want to install the panel in your home

1673
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,360
Do I need a plant? I am buying one

1674
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,600
am I importing it from China or

1675
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:50,400
Dada bought it locally, he is coming from outside.

1676
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:53,199
Ok? I am a contractor. Then

1677
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:56,320
What did that guy see? where does this item come from

1678
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:59,360
Used to be? so he started as a contractor

1679
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,440
Just An Installation Guy At Homes. Then

1680
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,600
What did he do? If friend comes from home

1681
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:06,719
Factory required. We don't think so

1682
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,520
At home but in the plant if my ₹1

1683
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,360
The units were left and then he entered the plants.

1684
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,679
Then he started taking on bigger contracts

1685
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,239
Do. Then what did he say? Yaar Main Panels

1686
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,880
Should I start making it or trading?

1687
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:21,280
Karani then started manufacturing again. Now

1688
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,520
He has become very big. you understand?

1689
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:26,560
The contract is almost zero investment

1690
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:29,679
Raise. So I am saying, go inside. I

1691
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,320
I'm not saying you know you can become a renewal

1692
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:35,120
You know renewable energy and you can become you

1693
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,679
No start up a gigawatt of solar energy

1694
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:41,040
Plant. It will take time to reach there. But

1695
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:44,640
Enter the area. When you enter the solar panel

1696
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:48,000
You started walking on that path, you got a thousand

1697
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:51,520
Things came to light, all ecosystems came to light

1698
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Who is the supplier, who is the buyer and who is purchasing it

1699
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,880
What are the factors then you can start with

1700
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,120
start to scale up when you get my point

1701
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:03,040
Let's take your YouTube example.

1702
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:06,159
like when you started how much would you have

1703
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:08,880
Learn and relearn but if you were working in

1704
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:12,560
In some other fields I don't know these news

1705
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:15,280
moving end may be 10 years back or when

1706
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:18,400
wherever you started you would never have

1707
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:22,080
Imagine that I will cover such a journey

1708
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:24,000
Kya Hum So A Journey Of 1000 Steps

1709
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,840
Starts with the first step right away

1710
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,760
The mile starts with the first step

1711
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,719
have to do it. so to answer your question

1712
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,880
Start with the minimum investment which

1713
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,920
can even be a contracting and

1714
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,679
Trading and then slowly building it up. it

1715
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,920
How to start contracting or trading

1716
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,159
We do? Just ask your friends. brother look

1717
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:44,560
So I'm starting this. you my

1718
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:46,560
Have to give 10 references. solar at home

1719
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,719
This is the advantage of the panel. whom shall I tell

1720
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,480
Should I take a meeting? at least this friend of i

1721
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:52,159
Mind that's how he started. Brother I

1722
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,719
I am starting a business. did a lot of job

1723
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:57,920
Year. Rajeev, I need 10 references and 10 each

1724
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:00,560
Asked people and educated them. from home

1725
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:05,520
Started and then he went to the factory.

1726
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:07,520
So it will happen by your network. as we are

1727
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,640
you know marwadi community, gujarati

1728
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:13,679
community, jain community have a lot of

1729
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:16,480
Support. so you have to see we are the network

1730
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:19,520
you can tap into whoever you ask bro

1731
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:22,080
If you need help then say come on friend, let's go

1732
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,600
Friend, stop picking up the phone. This is how it is today

1733
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,920
The world is like this. Tell someone your work

1734
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,000
He will stop picking up the phone. You tell someone friend

1735
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,159
He needs to be trained and given a job.

1736
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
That is the easiest way he will not block you.

1737
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:34,159
But he will start ignoring you. As such

1738
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,120
No network required. so to answer your

1739
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:40,239
Questions Look at Your Network People Who Want

1740
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,840
To you to do well seek out support that

1741
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:46,400
Boss, I am doing this, tell me how can you help me

1742
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:48,800
you can easily got it okay i think this is

1743
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:52,080
a variant point where we should bring up

1744
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:55,280
supply chain supply chain means what sir ok

1745
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:57,600
Please explain it easily, this is a very big business

1746
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,920
Career loan is a very important thing, see

1747
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,440
There are two types of things in the supply chain

1748
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:05,679
Inbound and Outbound Supply Chain

1749
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,400
What is it basically? what does supply chain mean

1750
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:11,120
Is? things to make any goods

1751
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:13,600
It seems so. to make things happen

1752
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,280
It happens. Ok? so if I get a product

1753
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,159
Have to make it. Let's get me a washing machine

1754
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,320
Have to make it. It has x number of parts.

1755
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:23,679
may be those parts are coming from various

1756
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,760
Geographies. Right? those geographies can

1757
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:28,960
be with in india can be outside of

1758
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:32,719
India. So one is an inbound logistics.

1759
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:35,520
Ok? Like a part of me has to come from China.

1760
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:38,159
One part has to come from Europe. one part russia

1761
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,840
Have to come from. Everything of mine is ready. One

1762
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:43,520
My part got stuck. something with china

1763
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:46,640
The problem started. We are a live example

1764
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:49,120
Is. Now I am not the kind of person who can use a washing machine

1765
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:52,639
Sir, it is not just a roller. take the rest

1766
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:56,239
Go. So it is important to understand this in the supply chain

1767
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:59,840
that's all the parts

1768
01:21:56,239 --> 01:22:03,440
of the entire system from the time that

1769
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:06,960
Placing a parts order is a great help to that supplier.

1770
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:09,440
Is there capacity? Is that capacity in this timeline?

1771
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,920
I will probably meet everyone

1772
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,239
synchronize he is saying sir i

1773
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:16,159
I will give you the goods, call me again on 10th June

1774
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:18,639
Sir, I will give it on 10th July so what

1775
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:20,800
I will make it half and keep it aside, do you understand this point?

1776
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:23,440
yes it is in very crude language i understood

1777
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:26,560
I have been. Over simplified. so this is

1778
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:28,880
Inbound Logistics to Make Something. It

1779
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,840
Needs x number of parts. those parts

1780
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:34,639
should reach at one point in time so that i

1781
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,440
Can plan my manufacturing line. This

1782
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:39,040
This is part A. then there is outbound

1783
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:42,320
Logistics.

1784
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:45,199
After I have made the goods, I will give it to her

1785
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:48,320
I am transporting it. what's in it

1786
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:50,880
Is there a complication? The most important thing is

1787
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:54,400
Time of delivery.

1788
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:58,080
Logistics cost. what is the right board

1789
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:00,880
to you know should i put it on a truck, should i

1790
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:02,880
Put it on a you know the trailer? should i send

1791
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,719
Is it by train? should i if it is being

1792
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,199
Exported which is the nearest port.

1793
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:09,840
Should I send it to that port by train or bus?

1794
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:12,400
should I send it? Should I send it by truck or by trailer?

1795
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:16,159
Then transit is a very important thing

1796
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:18,639
Damages. How should the packing be? Fragile

1797
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:22,080
What is it? How fragile is it? The dent will come

1798
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:24,400
What? This is a basic supply chain. But

1799
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:27,600
What does it contain? where is the problem in that

1800
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:30,639
does it come? as i give you that example chain is

1801
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:34,080
Strong as the Weakest Link.

1802
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:37,280
If even a single part does not arrive on time then

1803
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:41,199
Your assembly line will stop. So if

1804
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:43,440
plant of car or any other car stopped working

1805
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:45,679
Understand the factory today, two, three or four people

1806
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:48,639
And I lost my job.

1807
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:51,840
It is like murder.

1808
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:55,360
So that is supply chain management. We Butt I

1809
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:59,040
only explain the part of timing match,

1810
01:23:55,360 --> 01:24:01,199
Cost, Quality, Inbound Quality. My

1811
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,280
The quality of the product is dependent on

1812
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:05,120
My inbound quality. how to check that

1813
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:08,800
had been? What is its mechanism?

1814
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:13,120
How will the rejections happen? this whole piece

1815
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:16,400
Sounds boring. the money is in us

1816
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:20,080
Because trades are now mine and my circle

1817
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:24,880
me u know de sale construction de sale

1818
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:27,520
Tiles Now understand them in tiles

1819
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:31,840
1 lakh square feet showroom built ok

1820
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:35,120
Made in Faridabad with let's

1821
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:37,360
Now what is their value addition in that

1822
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,360
Mall in Tiles Showroom in Faridabad

1823
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:42,480
I will see, maybe I will meet the person from Delhi

1824
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:44,480
Let me go and negotiate. Butt Manufacturing

1825
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:48,639
I believe you have that competitive advantage. Are you

1826
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:51,520
Getting my peace? Trading and You Know the Money

1827
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:55,199
and the margins are always going to be

1828
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:57,679
larger because you have more leverage in

1829
01:24:55,199 --> 01:25:01,199
Manufacturing. in trading you are kind

1830
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:02,880
Of you know compressed. hmm means trading

1831
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:04,560
is a good starting point. it's a very

1832
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,000
Good starting point. because less capital

1833
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:10,800
Is. But again, what are you trading? His

1834
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,960
What kind of retail space is required for this? Online Tax

1835
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,440
You can, that's a good thing. but if you have a

1836
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,880
If you want a fancy place then it's not a good

1837
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:19,840
Point to start with. like you gov

1838
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,639
Example of cloud kitchen vs a fancy one

1839
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:25,280
restaurant. Got it. Ok. Summarize a little

1840
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,679
I would like to do it. basically if it's boring

1841
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:30,320
If you want to enter business then consider supply chain

1842
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,400
Management has to be learnt. Supply Chain

1843
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:34,560
If you want to learn management then my personal advice

1844
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,800
This is to find mentors and learn AI

1845
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,199
Use it. At least your learning speed

1846
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,040
will increase but the fastest way to increase

1847
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,840
Learning speed is to apply yourself.

1848
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:46,560
Absolutely. So you are saying that trading off

1849
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,639
a part of the supply chain that identifies

1850
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,239
Do it and get in there. Absolutely. that's why

1851
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:53,040
You can begin your business career.

1852
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:54,960
Exactly. then what before that part

1853
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,679
what comes and what comes after that is good

1854
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,679
Know from. Exactly. and at some point you

1855
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:02,880
You will learn yourself that yes, I am good at this thing

1856
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:05,120
I will be able to do manufacturing. and because of that

1857
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,840
This is part of the supply chain, this is mine

1858
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,920
It just happened. In addition this is the second

1859
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,159
The share will be mine too. Correct. this is

1860
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:15,920
The Basic Game Plan. That is absolutely correct.

1861
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:18,000
Ok. About A & Joe Industries

1862
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,800
You mentioned about the five-six industries.

1863
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,639
Same game plan applies across. so see if

1864
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:27,920
You go historically. Yes. We who are traders

1865
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:30,560
community or the trader community

1866
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,520
It has been there for 2000 years. Ok? since 2000 years

1867
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:36,560
Trade Lots of Traders Industrialists

1868
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,480
How to become it? Are traders just traders?

1869
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,400
Is it Marwari or Gujarati or Baniya?

1870
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,560
Are you a trader? they became got inu

1871
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:46,000
manufacturing but they started with

1872
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:48,800
Trading. You get my point? Yes. from the bad

1873
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,520
What would be bad? The stuff I bought,

1874
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:54,239
What you bought for ₹2 or what you bought for ₹200,

1875
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,560
I will sell it for 180, I will sell it for 160, that much

1876
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:58,400
I will sell only whatever I have. So Backward

1877
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:01,679
And then he did forward integration.

1878
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:05,360
hmm hmm because they got a foot in the door

1879
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:07,760
I got my foot in the door, where did you understand the whole system?

1880
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,639
what is missing but go inside and then

1881
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:13,520
built it you can't start with the

1882
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:16,320
Elephant right I mean you have to start

1883
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:19,199
Small Understand the Gaps and Then Build

1884
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:23,520
it up how much time does it take to go

1885
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:27,040
From Being a Trader to a Profitable Trader

1886
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,880
To become an industrialist one generation

1887
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:33,199
wow

1888
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:38,080
wow even today we are saying it will take one generation

1889
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:40,000
Meaning that it would take half a generation if one

1890
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:42,880
I didn't feel complete when I said what it meant

1891
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,000
30 years of work harsh truth 15 20 years

1892
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:49,360
It will not seem so easy that you become a trader today

1893
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,520
And you become completely different because your mentality is completely different

1894
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,040
Is. The game is completely different. your talking to you

1895
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,360
Saying Trader Versus Industry

1896
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:58,560
A huge game change in manufacturing

1897
01:27:55,360 --> 01:28:01,440
Is. So you can assume that for 20 years, you know

1898
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,920
true transition you know it can take that

1899
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:06,719
kind of time it can be done earlier also

1900
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:11,679
But I am saying that

1901
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:15,600
If you don't know the whole game

1902
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:17,920
If you close your eyes and enter in a hurry

1903
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,480
Chances of failure will increase

1904
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:23,600
You can do it exponentially faster but

1905
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:26,000
Haste is the devil's work. Nowadays we are not one

1906
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,000
Slang has become very popular. These

1907
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Actually comes from the basketball world.

1908
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,159
Like his name is LeBron James. He is very

1909
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:36,639
He used to say this. It has now become a slang word

1910
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:38,560
Is. The slang word is generational wealth. We

1911
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:42,360
That means that

1912
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,360
Money like a dog.

1913
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:49,520
But the Truth About Generational Wealth Is 20 Years Old

1914
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:52,800
It seems so. Practically Speaking Minimum

1915
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:56,880
Maybe 30 years. He is not ready to do any

1916
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:59,040
To. We need it quickly because attention span

1917
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,679
It isn't there, right? See it in everything

1918
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:03,600
Same thing is happening in relationships also. Job

1919
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:06,239
Same thing is happening in me too. means in everything

1920
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:09,600
it's happening quickly quickly quick

1921
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:12,639
Quickie Quickie That's Instant Gratification.

1922
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:15,600
Brother, who will take 15 years? so what bro

1923
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:18,480
will you do it? Get bankrupt. we mean his

1924
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,760
The second option is this. so i wonder if you have

1925
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:25,040
Cracked the Formula. If you are trading a

1926
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:29,440
You learned a little bit better game plan

1927
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:32,400
Also made a for manufacturing. From

1928
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:34,880
If you're at your five year mark. can you

1929
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:37,840
Raise money to jump to the next level. and you

1930
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:39,920
Can but that also has to be calculated. it see

1931
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,560
I am saying this. the money they're giving you

1932
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:45,600
He is taking a bet on you. Hmm. Now

1933
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:48,320
Many people who become investors, after seeing this guy

1934
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,400
I also apply it. I have seen like I talk

1935
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,320
To these people, friend, what did you see? Business

1936
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,040
The plan was rubbish, the guy was on fire

1937
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:59,280
Buddy. That bastard will do something. the plan was rubbish

1938
01:29:55,040 --> 01:30:02,719
The guy was right. We sleep like this too. but however

1939
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:05,760
If You're Wanting to Raise Money You Have to Show

1940
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:08,719
Some proof of concept. I am your brother

1941
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:11,840
Why should I believe it? what am i betting

1942
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:14,639
On? Am I betting on your idea? Am I

1943
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,600
Betting on Your Potential and Am I Betting

1944
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:20,400
On your execution capability? Any 

1945
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,800
because i have to secure my money na that

1946
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:25,679
It is important that you have to answer this question

1947
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:28,719
In your mind why should somebody invest

1948
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:31,040
That's Money on Me and the Biggest Myth Vi

1949
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:33,199
The youngster's idea was great. The idea of

1950
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:36,320
There is no money. execution money

1951
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:38,639
Execution Your Capability Your Team Your

1952
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:41,440
fire in the belly bl bl bl the sigma of

1953
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:43,840
All that we know in this chapter, haven't you?

1954
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:46,239
Golden nuggets have been given. if someone likes

1955
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:51,040
I would have said this at age 22

1956
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:53,600
thank you sir but the truth is of this chapter

1957
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:55,840
The chapters that came earlier are more important

1958
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,600
is for the audience to learn to handle

1959
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,639
Yourself. Learn to handle your finances.

1960
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,639
Learn to handle growing in your career.

1961
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:06,000
So we will move on to the next chapter.

1962
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:09,199
Ok? which is also a small case study but at the

1963
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,080
Same time it's mainly for family businesses.

1964
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:15,760
Because this topic has not been covered in this

1965
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:17,840
And I feel it's a very different topic on the show.

1966
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,239
because those who are also freshers who have

1967
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,840
I have never even started a business. whose

1968
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:25,840
Even families don't have businesses

1969
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:27,840
You will get the perspective. but this is for

1970
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,639
Families Who Are Trying to Figure Out How to Make

1971
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:35,280
The Businesses Grow Further Pass It On To The

1972
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:37,920
Next generation to scale sure okay a first

1973
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:40,960
Let’s start with a case study

1974
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:43,280
Ambani case study loosely you can explain it

1975
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:46,239
what did Dhirubhai Ambani do and then

1976
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:48,159
Ah what did you say to Mukesh Ambani loosely speaker

1977
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:50,080
And then what did Mukesh Ambani do?

1978
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:52,239
What is the plan for the third generation. So

1979
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,159
this is you know obviously based on not my

1980
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:57,199
First Hand Experience But Whatever I

1981
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:59,920
have seen heard observed so dhirubhai also

1982
01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:02,159
Started as a trader, we trade

1983
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:05,440
Then after that Wright came into manufacturing

1984
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:07,840
Textiles and plastics came into those things

1985
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:11,760
then he took a very big risk which is

1986
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:14,480
called jamnagar refinery now let me tell you

1987
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:17,440
When the Jamnagar refinery was being set up and

1988
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,679
He created capacity and some of the people

1989
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:23,199
who work with him at that time i have had

1990
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:25,600
work with them and they said

1991
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:28,400
I too had told Dhiru Bhai that Sir once

1992
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:31,920
Think about it, it's not that big of a risk

1993
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:34,320
It's okay and this is something I heard

1994
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,560
I put this disclaimer on my own

1995
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,639
I am here so he said what will happen

1996
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:42,400
No sir, whatever you have done in all these years

1997
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:44,400
I have made it, it will become zero sir, that's all

1998
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:48,080
No

1999
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:50,480
We will start again, this is Dheeru Bhai I AM

2000
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,320
sure he would have secured the family i am

2001
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:54,960
I'm not very sure about that

2002
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:58,560
Ranveer because whenever Jamnagar refinery's

2003
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:02,480
jo risk hai somebody has to salute that

2004
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:07,199
person to take that kind of risk and the

2005
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:10,800
People have head in many places it is mentioned panchratna

2006
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:12,719
you know the really great team he had at least

2007
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:15,360
one or two people i know because i work with

2008
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:17,600
them like they are like i would touch their feet

2009
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:20,000
Any time means that it is respect

2010
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:22,239
He said we stood correct it. We

2011
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,960
Also tried to stop the hand. he said

2012
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:26,800
Look friend, I listened to everyone. not like that

2013
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,120
It is that Dhiru Bhai used to ignore that I have

2014
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:31,600
The Answers. He said, okay tell me what is the risk?

2015
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,480
This is capacity risk. Capex Risk

2016
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:37,040
Is. Sensitivity analysis. you know this is a

2017
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:39,440
the very thing that if I assumed

2018
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:42,000
This much stuff will be sold. if it is not sold so much

2019
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,480
If production does not happen, will there be a loss? These

2020
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:48,000
He said this after listening to everything. I heard all

2021
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:50,800
Of you with full respect. but we are

2022
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,280
Going Ahead as an Entrepreneur This is my

2023
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:56,800
There is a call. so you understand and that was the

2024
01:33:53,280 --> 01:34:00,480
Game changer for Reliance Jamnagar refinery

2025
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:04,320
has built reliance because the kind of

2026
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:07,040
Scale Cash Flows Everything It Brings You Know

2027
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:10,320
Did everything for Reliance. understand this point

2028
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:13,280
I came. now we go to the next what

2029
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:19,520
I saw when I was working in that company

2030
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:22,159
is that which Mukesh bhai inherited

2031
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:26,000
He did that before I left Reliance this

2032
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:29,760
How much did you build and grow but what

2033
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:33,440
what has happened in the last 10-15 years is so

2034
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:36,800
The One Transformation That Reliance Went Through

2035
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:37,600
This is what we call reincarnation or avatar

2036
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,560
Vaz

2037
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:43,199
Dhiru bhai to Mukesh bhai but I think third

2038
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:45,520
An incarnation has taken place which no one is seeing. like those

2039
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,920
Great people whose feet I touch even today

2040
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:50,880
I will touch it. He said we stand corrected

2041
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,960
In front of Dhiru Bhai Will. I also stand

2042
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:56,560
I am corrected. I am confessing today.

2043
01:34:52,960 --> 01:35:00,080
When he was investing in Jio. End

2044
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:02,320
I had some idea how much you were doing. 50000

2045
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:06,400
It became crores. Then Rs 1 lakh on top of that. They

2046
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:09,280
I said, brother, the ship will shake, brother.

2047
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:12,080
Then you are coming into consumer brands. You

2048
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:13,679
So you are the king of B2B, friend. Where to Be

2049
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,920
Are you entering B? Where to enter retail

2050
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:19,280
had been? Where are you getting into telecom?

2051
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:21,840
I also thought that this is the right

2052
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:24,320
Strategy? Because you are great at being to be

2053
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:27,040
You are not so good at being a jerk. but what did

2054
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:30,320
did it happen? what happened? today they are ruling

2055
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,880
Even there. so to move from be to be like

2056
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:36,480
I said it takes a generation, right, trader?

2057
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:39,199
to become a B2B manufacturer

2058
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:42,480
It probably takes one lifetime to go from B to C

2059
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:44,800
It cannot happen and maybe it cannot happen

2060
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:46,880
Like Schneider Electric or ABB

2061
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,960
So washing machines will someday come in B2C

2062
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,560
will you make it

2063
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:54,560
But Reliance did it and culturally too

2064
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:57,520
A lot has changed now when I go there it is

2065
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:00,400
a different company so imagine a petroleum

2066
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:03,600
ium company a petrochemicals company gates

2067
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:05,440
Innu Consumer Facing Business Gets In The

2068
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,520
The Next Generation Stitches It and Builds

2069
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:10,239
It. I mean what could be a better story

2070
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,400
Then that. I think a lot of young people do this

2071
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:14,159
Believe that Ambani family has a no

2072
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,639
Golden hands are such that they can handle anything with their hands

2073
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:19,440
If applied it turns into gold. but it's not

2074
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:21,280
Like that. Look at those businesses which don't take off

2075
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:24,880
Are. So Reliance is always in project

2076
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:26,960
Stage. We used to watch this many times parallelly, friend

2077
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,360
Which team is this? What are they doing?

2078
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:33,440
There are many projects when 100 people are sitting together

2079
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:36,480
They keep studying and many don't even do that.

2080
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:38,880
Do. but I would also think that this is

2081
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,880
The Golden Hand Theory Seems to Be Right

2082
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:44,639
Because it would be hard to find a business

2083
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:48,880
In which they field. We But At Reliance Core

2084
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:52,800
Something is going right mentally.

2085
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:56,080
Culturally, Mentality Wise, A Strategy

2086
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:58,080
Wise. So what is that core? So look at the core I

2087
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:01,520
I can only tell you my own experience

2088
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:03,760
Because I also mean limited visibility

2089
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:06,719
I was in a product line when I first started

2090
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:09,920
I did the presentation and I went on a Honda

2091
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:12,480
So brother MAC, there is some tension when

2092
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,719
I did the first one and this is to show you the mentality

2093
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:16,639
I made great preparations for my first presentation and one

2094
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:19,600
of the Executive Directors relating to

2095
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:21,360
Mukesh bhai Sheetal Miswani was there

2096
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,440
My bosses were big people,

2097
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,480
He said if you do it then I am Chotu Ram you know

2098
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:29,040
He is a DGM level guy. they are all to

2099
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:31,280
I started the presentation. the first or

2100
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,840
It was on the second slide. He said, son, sit down.

2101
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:37,840
I said no sir, no no sit down.

2102
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:39,520
Rajiv, why did you ask these three questions?

2103
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,360
made? I said Sir, who is related to Petroleum

2104
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:45,679
We want to open petrol pumps, its channel

2105
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:48,400
There is a strategy. Ok. so we companies have you

2106
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,920
Benchmarked? I am BPCL this December. No

2107
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:52,159
no no we are not talking about India

2108
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:54,000
have been. Which global company did you choose?

2109
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:56,320
Have you seen it in petroleum? I said global

2110
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,719
So I did not see it. good but you

2111
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:01,280
I don't want to look at petroleum. You have 71

2112
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:05,119
Store Dekha which is the best franchise

2113
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:08,239
Model in the world? 71 McDonald's did you

2114
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:13,280
Study Duncan Donuts

2115
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:15,920
We will start with a global scale

2116
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:19,199
was a because i have worked in Honda which

2117
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:21,600
is a multinational but the thinking is what

2118
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:23,920
Happened? My third presentation was discussed

2119
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,000
did not go to the slide. and i learn my lesson

2120
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:28,159
that Gupta ji you should improve yourself if you come here

2121
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,119
If you want to survive then one thing is to think

2122
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:33,679
Global but there is a difference between

2123
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:38,000
Thinking Global: Many people think global, but I

2124
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:41,440
Call That Sabse Baagh and Sheikh Chilli Ke Khwab

2125
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,719
They also make it happen that's the one difference.

2126
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:47,840
so fire you know that fire in the belly that go

2127
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:50,080
Getter Attitude Having the Teams in Place

2128
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,239
Having the monitoring mechanisms in place

2129
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:55,360
Having the Resources in Place People in

2130
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:59,119
place and they are way ahead of time when I

2131
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:02,000
when i joy them i mean everything was

2132
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:05,280
Online in 2002 means I don't have prescriptions

2133
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,280
I had to make a book of leaves in 2002 so I did a book

2134
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:09,520
He used to make leave slips in a multinational company

2135
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:12,000
or go out to the factory to sleep

2136
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:14,400
They have adopted technology for so long

2137
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,639
We can only see the glitter outside.

2138
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,679
But what goes in is that we don't see. So

2139
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:22,080
This is the mentality. Think Global But Make

2140
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:24,560
It happens. We and what will it take to make

2141
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:27,840
can it happen? We

2142
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:30,480
Ok. Now the same case from a practical point of view

2143
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:33,040
Let us analyse the study. for first

2144
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:36,159
Generation Entrepreneurs Like Me. Mukesh

2145
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:38,719
Ambani is like God for us. that wow

2146
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:40,880
What a business story. but honestly we

2147
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:44,080
Can only aspire to be Dhirubhai Ambani.

2148
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,080
Is there truth in the statement? Absolutely

2149
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:48,320
Ok. no you can only aspire to be

2150
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:51,040
Dheeru bhai. because when you start you

2151
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:55,280
The advantage that Mukesh Bhai got will be available to you too

2152
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:58,080
Not there. ok and in order to become a

2153
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,760
The Potential Dhirubhai Ambani We Need Too

2154
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,480
Master Everything We Have Spoken About Till

2155
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,679
This Point in the Podcast. Absolutely. Correct.

2156
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:10,000
Now let's talk about the second generation

2157
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:12,560
Are. So there are two questions. The first question is that

2158
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,800
What do you think Dhirubhai Ambani said about Mukesh Ambani?

2159
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,960
What did others teach Ambani on a core level?

2160
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:20,159
Then the technicalities?

2161
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:23,920
The second question is that in a 2020

2162
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:27,840
keeping the context in mind

2163
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:30,159
If a family run business is to be taken to the next generation

2164
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:32,080
What to keep in mind when training a

2165
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:35,280
Needed?

2166
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:38,159
So I have to only guess. so what do i think

2167
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:41,600
That Dhiru Bhai Ji needs to be taught something

2168
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:44,719
It might not have been there. s i always say children

2169
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:49,280
Learn by watching the parents. so i think

2170
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:52,000
Value systems that are go-getters for hard work

2171
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:54,000
And if you have decided about it then you have to do it.

2172
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,880
i think this is what would have been

2173
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,679
definitely transmitted not merely through the

2174
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:03,040
DNA and through the blood but by living in the

2175
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:07,040
Same house and working in the same company. So

2176
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:09,840
Working Hard Having a Gotter Attitude and

2177
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:12,000
whatever you set out to do don't leave your

2178
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:15,440
College in Between.

2179
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,920
If you have picked it up then you have to do something boss

2180
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:20,719
Let that reliability power focus on the

2181
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:23,760
Controllables and Cuts Off the Noise Exactly

2182
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:27,360
so i think this spirit of work hard

2183
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:30,080
Global Thinking Think Big Think Really Big

2184
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:33,119
Think Global because I think one of Reliance

2185
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:35,119
There is an unspoken strategy. Any we business

2186
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:38,080
We have to be number one in India

2187
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:40,080
And top three in the world. it's very

2188
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:43,520
clear. Number one in India, top three in

2189
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:48,480
The World. So that is the thinking of many people

2190
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:50,639
we god these are the learnings that dhirubhai

2191
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:53,119
Ambani Possibly Passed On To Mukesh Ambani

2192
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:55,760
or i have heard something similar in most

2193
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:57,440
Conversations that have had around this topic

2194
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:00,159
Now!

2195
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:03,040
I would like to ask you that a 2020

2196
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:06,239
keeping the context in mind

2197
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:09,760
What a business owner teaches his kids

2198
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:13,280
so that's the second generation goes way

2199
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:18,880
Beyond the first generation. Ok. So

2200
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:22,320
it's very crude but I think that

2201
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:25,280
which is our mind, body and habits

2202
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:27,520
There is a lot of need to correct this generation a little.

2203
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:30,080
There is need. so i give a simple example

2204
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:33,840
that I haven't seen at least in my life

2205
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:36,239
in time that any person can do 40 hours or 45

2206
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,960
Hours may be available in the next generation. Address

2207
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:41,679
will it work after 20 years or any 20 hours or 15 or

2208
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:44,719
Can one be successful by working for 20 hours?

2209
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:47,520
so the first thing is that

2210
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:51,760
you have to have a body

2211
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:54,960
which can get out of the house at 8:00 am

2212
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,960
and get into the house at 8:00 p.m. End

2213
01:42:54,960 --> 01:43:00,080
it's like 12 hours including commute and

2214
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:02,239
You should be okay with it. hmm because those 12

2215
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:04,080
in hours just because of the environment

2216
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:07,520
You will learn a lot. Exactly outside

2217
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:11,360
You will go from home, it is commute time. so one is that

2218
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,920
Second, this is the get rich quick theory

2219
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:16,639
no I think whatever is teaching you or

2220
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,840
as many people i think that should be really

2221
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,840
Thrown out the window. The third thing is this

2222
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:25,600
If I am a family business owner. we are

2223
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:28,960
Talking of second gem. I think as a father

2224
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:31,840
I will carefully assess that this is my child

2225
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:34,800
Hey again what did I say? interest,

2226
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:37,040
Capability and Potential. if these three

2227
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:40,320
If my child is sitting in a triangle, then

2228
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:43,040
how do I fit that into this business and

2229
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:47,119
How do I train him? but if I think

2230
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:49,760
is that he is not going to be able to

2231
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:52,800
Succeed and fit into my shoes and I am that

2232
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:56,000
Business owner then I will create another system

2233
01:43:52,800 --> 01:44:00,000
End process. So that the business continues,

2234
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:03,440
The Life Style Continues and This Person

2235
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,880
does something align with his interest,

2236
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:09,920
capability and potential which is one way today

2237
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:13,280
traffic is that if you are not in this business

2238
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:17,520
If it comes you can't do anything. But even if

2239
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:21,440
Even if you want to do hard work, mentoring,

2240
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:24,320
Ecosystem, relationships, all this will have to be done.

2241
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:27,119
so i think as the next gen as a second

2242
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:29,679
Generation Owner and First Generation Passing to the

2243
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:33,440
next jan what i will do i would do is

2244
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:37,040
I would tell them it's absolutely fine to

2245
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:40,159
Be out and about for 12 hours in a day

2246
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:43,119
I am working hard because I don't want to die

2247
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:45,679
There is no need to curse Gaya. you should

2248
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:48,639
Be Grateful That You Have So Many Hours of Work

2249
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:51,199
Is. Hmm, the day when I will sit idle

2250
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:53,440
The day will come when you will understand what happens. Being

2251
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:56,719
Busy is a privilege is a privilege

2252
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:58,560
It is necessary. and you know your understanding

2253
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,880
interest this thing and also

2254
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,480
understanding your weaknesses that this is

2255
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,960
what I can do and this is what I can't

2256
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:07,119
Doo. i think these are the few things i would

2257
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:11,520
Like to know transfer to the next

2258
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:14,080
Generation. but as the owner as the custodian of the

2259
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:16,159
Business which I have set up.

2260
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:19,600
I will ensure that I am putting the best

2261
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:22,800
person out there not my son not my daughter

2262
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:26,719
If that person is not the best suited person

2263
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:30,000
For the interest of the business we get you the

2264
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:32,239
Point Yes

2265
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,760
Now you are basically saying that the child's

2266
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:38,480
Recognize the personality if personality

2267
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:41,040
if it is not suitable then rather take care of yourself

2268
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:42,719
Business not your child yah. and figure it out

2269
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:45,920
How to take care of child's future.

2270
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:48,239
Absolutely. The person whose upbringing is different,

2271
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:51,360
The guy for whom everything is different, why are you

2272
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:53,920
Trying to convert him into your image?

2273
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:56,080
God has made each individual in him

2274
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:59,600
Different image. Right? So, I am saying this

2275
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:03,840
I am here to take this business forward

2276
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:08,719
What should my child be like? Right?

2277
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:11,360
To be smart, to be clever, you know, to be savvy,

2278
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:14,000
I will do all this by being a little political. And

2279
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:16,400
If I feel, Bhaiya, we cannot do this

2280
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,119
If that's the case then I will professionalize the company

2281
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:24,400
I will do it but he won't be sad my friend

2282
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:26,800
What God, what a donkey you created such a thing

2283
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:28,719
Language is business, is a donkey born from it?

2284
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:31,920
Maybe my wife also heard the sound

2285
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:34,639
Give me what a bastard you have brought out, what is all this

2286
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:38,320
these are useless things, may be he is meant to

2287
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:40,960
do something else than i will not have further

2288
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:43,920
quarrel with that issue but I will

2289
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:45,840
Professionalize the Company Put True Structures

2290
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:50,400
that the business of these places should also continue

2291
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:53,040
keep doing it. Last time today a lot

2292
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,560
There are huge options. Sell ​​the company friend

2293
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:57,440
To.

2294
01:46:54,560 --> 01:47:01,119
You have a company worth Rs 250 crore or Rs 500 crore.

2295
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:04,080
Ok? Your EBITDA from LETS is 10%.

2296
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:05,840
EBITDA is in a very bad state at 15%.

2297
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:09,040
Ok? So how much is it? 75 crores

2298
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:11,440
Went. There must be some valuation. you sell off

2299
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,600
Do it to the company. Create wealth and give it away

2300
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:17,520
To the children. Slowly after taking out IPO

2301
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:19,920
Unlock your wealth. So why are we in the same

2302
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,159
We are stuck in our own labyrinth,

2303
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,960
My son will take care of it. there are ways to

2304
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:28,480
Unlock that Wealth and Create the Well Being

2305
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:32,560
For the future generations. but the dispute is in

2306
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:36,159
our mind is family for the business or is

2307
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:38,960
Business for the Family. we are there for purpose

2308
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:41,600
The needle gets stuck in it. Wow.

2309
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:44,080
Because there is no clarity in this itself.

2310
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:46,880
Why do you want to do business now? friend of the kids

2311
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:49,520
Life style should be good. Ok? So

2312
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,639
Unlock his wealth. sell it to him

2313
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:55,040
Make a system. Yes, if business is morant

2314
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:58,320
then family, then another structure was added to it

2315
01:47:55,040 --> 01:48:00,159
Two. That's the only way out. Hmm. but why

2316
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:02,880
It's Just Quarreling and Fighting It's Not

2317
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:06,480
Going to happen. Understood and Absorb

2318
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:09,520
everything you said so but that's why it's not

2319
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:11,119
Shocking to me that there are many such people in our country

2320
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:14,000
all are business families which have gone

2321
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:17,280
Beyond Gen Two Gen Three Gen Three and the

2322
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,360
Ambanis Themselves Are Gen Three Right Now

2323
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:22,320
I don't know what's gone right now. I know

2324
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:25,600
We have addressed this in the past. butt so i

2325
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:27,520
Let me answer this. Latest Survey Shows

2326
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:30,800
and i'm not surprised the number could be

2327
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:32,800
Peacock. 50% off the next does not want to join

2328
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:36,159
The Family Business.

2329
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:39,760
But according to me it might be 70 or 80

2330
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:41,600
Survey says 50. Why? I have family

2331
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:44,560
The benefits that you are getting from the business

2332
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:49,119
I want it but I don't want to die. What is the reason

2333
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:52,080
His? There are two reasons. Boring Business End

2334
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:58,639
Somebody breathing down my neck. That means that

2335
01:48:52,080 --> 01:49:01,679
Father. Papa Uncle Uncle Grandfather Elder Cousin Elder

2336
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:04,000
Sibling the list is endless

2337
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:06,320
Brother, minimum what I have seen is very few like this

2338
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,199
there will be families that are somewhat of the same size that

2339
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:11,840
It's father and son, there must be uncle

2340
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:14,880
Because the brothers of the grandfather were different

2341
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:19,440
If there are four people then the minimum number of uncles will be

2342
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:21,520
cousin and that is fine and if there is a sibling then let

2343
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,480
don't want to breathe people down

2344
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:26,239
The Neck

2345
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:28,800
second and this was you know some recent one

2346
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:31,440
of the person who enrolled in our course told

2347
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,600
I say sir if you will teach me then

2348
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:35,520
I don’t want to do the family business

2349
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,840
Why do you say sir there is no break in life

2350
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,719
Why do I say anything sir my mind is cooked

2351
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:43,280
Those things happen in the morning as well as in the afternoon

2352
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:46,000
They didn’t let me do anything even in the evening

2353
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:49,440
I want my sir to be like this

2354
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:52,320
Make me do the course so that I can get a job

2355
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:54,719
the issue is a money is an accept

2356
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:58,159
The business was interesting enough to match with the

2357
01:49:54,719 --> 01:50:00,320
Kids But 50% Off The Kids Don't Want To Run

2358
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:02,960
The Family Business. now how do we solve that

2359
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:07,040
problem and imagine what would be that

2360
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:10,159
Number? There are 6.3 crore MSMEs in this

2361
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:12,719
Country. Ok? I think that's the number. Now

2362
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:15,360
What will happen? their children cannot drive

2363
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:18,320
Want. Are they lying outside or their life

2364
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:22,159
Is. that's the problem this country needs to

2365
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:24,320
Solv. So what will happen to these businesses? Close

2366
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:27,199
will it happen or the wealth will be unlocked or sold

2367
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:30,560
Will go. Whatever can be sold will be sold. which is not

2368
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:32,960
It can be sold, he will run it as long as he can.

2369
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:36,800
That's what so happens. I remember when I

2370
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:39,119
I was 22 years old and when I was with my friends

2371
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,320
I used to watch lives. Where the friend is someone's family

2372
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:45,360
This is business. i thought to myself that wow what

2373
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:47,840
A platform. you know i wish i had that

2374
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:49,119
Platform. i could grow it into something

2375
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,159
Hughes.

2376
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:54,239
but then again as I grow older I get this

2377
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:56,000
I want to know that friend you can't always do it completely

2378
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:59,440
Empathize with people you don't know what

2379
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,840
What's actually happening behind closed doors

2380
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:06,159
Isn't it true that I am crazy in love with my pain

2381
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:10,480
I don't know of any other one, I will give you an example

2382
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:13,360
a guy from a top b school ok son of a

2383
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:16,000
Big Industrialist

2384
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:18,880
he is crying okay recently i met this

2385
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:22,320
Cow he was literally crying says sir

2386
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:24,960
A man committed a big mistake in his life, he is the only son

2387
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:28,000
That the school also came on top in the family business

2388
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:31,679
was in a dying state, as much as the head

2389
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:35,360
If I got breath I would have come

2390
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:37,599
If I could breathe, I would tell you how am I today

2391
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:39,679
my piercers they are getting multi

2392
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:42,960
Crore salary because he is from a top b

2393
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:45,199
Graduated from school 15-16 years ago

2394
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:48,400
He says, Sir, no one is worth even Rs.1 lakh per year to me.

2395
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:53,280
I will give it because I have never done a job

2396
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:56,400
Is. so this is the issue that is happening that the

2397
01:51:53,280 --> 01:52:00,800
the next gen is feeling suffocated

2398
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:05,360
And it's not about boring. boring is a

2399
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:08,320
Ellebaab and a Proxy for Over Bearing

2400
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:12,080
Seniors in the Family.

2401
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:13,599
Because they are not allowing them to have autonomy. Lala

2402
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:16,719
Lala

2403
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:19,679
because we

2404
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:22,960
My word is my rule

2405
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:26,239
And my rule will prevail but maybe this Lala

2406
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:28,400
the problem is unsolvable too you are right to

2407
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:30,560
a great extent can't solve that lala

2408
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:33,679
Look at the problem, I will tell you where it is

2409
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,960
It is unsolvable where it is not

2410
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:38,639
If Lala you started this with Tata

2411
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:41,119
Discussion

2412
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:43,599
If I come on the custodian ship by ownership

2413
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:46,880
Should I go? Let's take a simple example. First

2414
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:48,719
So I should have known that I would die.

2415
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,800
Maybe I will die. I don't know maybe

2416
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:55,199
Lala might not have died if it seemed so. These

2417
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:57,280
They are immortal. So

2418
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:59,920
What do I think about these?

2419
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:03,119
You did not ask, I am telling you that their

2420
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:06,320
What is thinking? that sometimes it is dharmasya

2421
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:09,679
Guilty Bhavati Bharatam. There is nothing like that

2422
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:12,480
This is God's incarnation, we are but because of

2423
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:16,000
humility they are calling themselves s

2424
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:17,920
King. I don't like to say God but

2425
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,639
I know that I am God. Sir you

2426
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:22,560
You should know that I am God. this god

2427
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:26,719
complex

2428
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:31,119
is the problem and this is the reason they become

2429
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:34,320
so overbearing but maturity of them are

2430
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:37,760
Like this. but there are examples wit

2431
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:40,400
Different? yes there are why not there are

2432
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:44,400
Example Sunil Bharti Mittal Harsh

2433
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:48,560
Mariwala Rahul Bajaj All Of Them Have Groom

2434
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:53,040
there airs anand mahra you know kumar mangalam

2435
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:55,520
Birla Godrej Family: Is it Overbearing?

2436
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:59,040
Parents are their children, look at Azim Prem

2437
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:02,880
yes how well are their children doing shiva

2438
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:05,920
Nadar Roshni Nadar is doing a fabulous job

2439
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:09,360
How many examples are there in which we can say

2440
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:12,639
that parents are not overbearing they have

2441
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:15,440
Give me a retirement date when I will die

2442
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:18,080
Brother, I don't know when I will die, when will death come

2443
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:20,159
If you don't know then groom the kids because

2444
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:23,040
I use bicycle stand for hand holding

2445
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:26,880
But the thing

2446
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:30,080
is the people who think they are immortal

2447
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:32,800
and who thinks that the universe goes around

2448
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:34,320
them and if they are not there then that is what happens

2449
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,880
An example that

2450
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:40,800
I am carrying the globe on my body. Doz R

2451
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:43,199
The People and You Know I Always Say This They Should

Be very clear in their head. to the children

2453
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:48,880
Let me breathe friend. if you are so over

2454
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,480
Be careful somebody needs to tell them. End

2455
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,159
I think the kids should figure it out

2456
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:54,480
Needed Study hard and get an MBA or

2457
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:56,080

Having the health and this thing then you come in

01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:10,880
this is a very important part of this whole

2463
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:13,280
Story That

2464
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:17,280
We need to understand the needs of this

2465
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:20,400
generation also they can't take so much of

2466
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:23,199

2468
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:28,400
All they need respect and they need

2469
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,119
Significance

He wants to create something. Meni

2471
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:37,199

01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:06,400
but unfortunately we are out of time all i

2482
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:09,440
want to say at this point is fun

2483
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:11,119
It was a very crisp value adding podcast

2484
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:14,000
These

2485
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:17,040
I taught myself business from Stanford

2486
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:20,239
From the series of lectures by Why Combinator

2487
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:21,920
upload some lectures the it was called

2488
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:24,800
how to start a startup

2489
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:27,679
But whatever has been discussed in this podcast today,

2490
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:30,639
It's much more practical than that series. So

2491
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:35,119
Happy to hear this Ranveer. I just hope that

Episode. When this episode was recorded

2500
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:59,119
The thought was that friend we should cut it and we should

2501
01:56:55,360 --> 01:57:02,080
Leave it deep as it is long lasting podcast

2502
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:04,239

Given because of his own teaching skills

2506
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:15,920
The obvious answer was leave it as it is

01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,679
