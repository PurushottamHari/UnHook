1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
Friends, it is possible that you are

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,400
living in the scenario of World War 3 right now and you may

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,800
not be aware of it.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,679
When the war started in 1914 and 1939, people did

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,920
not know that such a massive war would break out.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:22,640
Therefore, when the First World War took place from 1914 to 1918,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,600
it is called the Great War.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,240
And when the Second World War took place at

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,880
that time people had understood that the

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,680
dominance will remain with the country

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,520
which has the power.  So it is possible that

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,559
the scenario you are living in right now may be

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,360
a scenario of World War 3.

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,760
So when can we consider it to have started

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,920
?  We can consider its beginning

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,719
from 2022.  I still remember the time when Russia invaded

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,160
Ukraine after the Beijing Olympics ended

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,280
and

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,079
as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022,

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
you can consider it the beginning of World War 3.

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,760
You can write this on a paper with your pen.  It

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:10,240
started in 2022,

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,080
2023, 24, 25, today it has been 4 years.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,400
So we can consider its beginning from that time.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,040
Gradually a war begins.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
Like the First World War, like the

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,560
Second World War, it lasted for four to five years

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,680
and after that there was such an impact that the

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,560
whole world completes the situation of that war

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,880
, brings it under control

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,280
, brings it under control and it begins that

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
some countries surrender and

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,560
some countries establish their dominance.

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,040
So similarly, today we are going to talk about the scenario

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,720
whether World War 3 can

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,880
break out.  The biggest

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
point of view that is emerging from this is that

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,720
if Iran's nuclear facilities are

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,880
targeted effectively by America, then

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,240
this will mark the beginning of World War 3

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,960
and I will present some evidence and

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,119
facts before you which will actually

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,000
prove that World War 3 can

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,640
start now because of

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,760
Donald Trump leaving the G7 meeting midway

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,560
and coming to America and saying that the

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,160
conditions are very bad.  So let's

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,080
talk about it - if USA

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,640
targets Iran's nuclear

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,440
facilities, will it trigger

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,480
World War 3?  Will Tehran be targeted today in the same

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,040
way that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,440
targeted in 1945

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,000
?  If Nathansh, which

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,760
is the centre of a nuclear facility for Iran, is

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,920
targeted then we will

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,280
say that World War 3 has

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:52,000
started.  Let's talk about it,

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,800
but right now Donald Trump has given 60 days to Iran, saying

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,840
that you have 60 days

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,239
and if even a day goes beyond 60 days,

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,200
this will not be tolerated.  Why was this 60 days time

63
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,080
given?  So that Iran can think whether

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,040
it should sign the nuclear treaty

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,920
or not.  Yes and no.  But no

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,239
development was seen in between these 60 days

67
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,640
and on the 61st day,

68
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,200
this war was declared by Donald Trump saying,

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,000
okay brother, if you are not ready to sign, then

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,800
Israel will attack now.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,959
So that is considered to be the beginning of this war.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,519
But the thing is that against this,

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,680
Operation Riseon was launched by Israel with the intention of

74
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,480

75
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,360
attacking Iran because Iran had been

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,760

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,360
using the Accession of Resistance for a very long time and was using the rebel groups, Hos,

78
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,080
Hezbollah, Hamas,

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,400
against Israel. When Israel

80
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,680
started attacking Hamas, it completely

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,319
destroyed the Gaza Strip.

82
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,319
Israel attacked in such a manner that it gathered the

83
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,680
people in the south of the Gaza Strip.

84
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,400
Started distributing food there.  The

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,159
children were dying of hunger.  So

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,599
Israel distributed food at the place where

87
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,560
they had to gather that population.  So that

88
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,639
maximum children and women would

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,520
gather in the South of Gaza Strip and the

90
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
rest of Hamas fighters would

91
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
gather in the North and

92
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,080
Israel would be able to attack there easily.  So Israel

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,800
did this as part of a very well thought out conspiracy.  Recently, in the

94
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,040
attack which was carried out on Iran, the Mossad

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,360
intelligence officers had already

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,600
deployed the missiles there and

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
after that, the attack was carried out

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,680
under Operation Rising Lion,

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,400
Iran also attacked in retaliation to this.  Now here there is a

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,840
missile which is called

101
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,479
Hellfire Missile, Ninja Hellfire Missile,

102
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,960
it was given to Israel by USA

103
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,759
and Israel used this missile in its drones.

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,800

105
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,120
This missile is very powerful.  Once the target is locked, then

106
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
assume that no matter how much the target

107
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,280
moves, there will be no missile to hit it.

108
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,560
So USA

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,680
supplied weapons somewhere and after that this

110
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,800
war broke out.  Now, the situation is such that if

111
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,360
USA targets Iran with nuclear bombs,

112
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
then it can be assumed that

113
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,240
World War 3 will begin.  And

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,440
congratulations, you guys are living inside World War

115
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,919
Three.  Let me tell you how.

116
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,639
First of all look at the world scenario to see

117
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,600
what is happening where.  We start with

118
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,120
Russia and Ukraine.

119
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
So first of all the war broke out between Russia and Ukraine.

120
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,360

121
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,120
Ok?  Russia wants to include

122
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,039
Ukraine within its area by any means.

123
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
So there is a war going on between the two.

124
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,919
This is one condition going on here.   Let

125
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,320
us lock it down.  Second, we

126
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,440
go to China and Taiwan.

127
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,039
So China and Taiwan, this is Taiwan.

128
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,240
China is here.  This is Taiwan.

129
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,560
Under the One China Policy, China wants

130
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,880
Taiwan to be included within China.

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,199
India supports Taiwan's two-state

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
policy.  But China says that no,

133
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
Taiwan is a part of it.  So, let

134
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,360
us lock this as well.

135
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:30,400
War is going on here too.  Third, we lock

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,960
Israel and Iran.  Isn't it?  To Israel and Iran.

137
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,560
What can we do to Israel and Iran

138
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,840
?  Let's lock it here.

139
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,800
This is going on in two countries.  As well as

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,520
within India and Pakistan.

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,919
India and Pakistan.  Well,

142
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,280
this war is not that big.  Pakistan

143
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,600
made it look like a big war and even

144
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,360
gave the information that it was a

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,919
war with India which

146
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,000
Pakistan won.  He

147
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,319
recorded it in his history.  Think about it, for

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,560
us it was an isolated incident, okay,

149
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
terrorist incidents, blow up the terrorist hideouts, it was

150
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
just for us.  Pakistan

151
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,840
considers it a war.  Well, it doesn't matter, he

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,560
is a child, he will understand.  In one situation, we locked it.

153
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,720
We are locking these conditions.

154
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,360
And see what other possibilities there are.

155
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,000
You see that recently

156
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,479
India's relations with Canada have deteriorated a lot.  So

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,360
overall what this will

158
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,720
do gradually is that it will spark towards World War

159
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,800
3.  Now America being America,

160
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,759
what will it do?

161
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,960
If he drops a nuclear bomb on Iran's nuclear facilities,

162
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,360
Iran will be enraged and World War

163
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,080
3 will begin.  Now

164
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,160
which country will stay with whom here?  So

165
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,560
we will have to divide it into two factions.  There will

166
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,199

167
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,199
be two sides in it: Access and Allies.  So, assume

168
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,280
that if a

169
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,800
war breaks out between India and Pakistan, then India will be busy in its own war.

170
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,960
But

171
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,319
how will he fare among others and other warriors?   It will

172
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,840
remain separate.  will remain non-aligned.  Well, let

173
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,879
me explain one thing to you very clearly

174
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,639
that India being non-aligned is not India's

175
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,680
weakness.  If India is

176
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,639
not happy with the policies of USA.  The USSR is

177
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,360
not happy with Russia's policies.

178
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,599

179
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,240
If we are not happy with either the capitalist or the communist policies then

180
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,479
what do we do?  We move away from them and say that

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
we neither support them

182
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,479
nor do we support them.  We are

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
separate from ourselves.  It is non-aligned and it is

184
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,760
not wrong to be non-aligned.  By remaining non-aligned

185
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,680
we prove to ourselves that

186
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,719
this is also not right.  This

187
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,560
is also not right.  We will take the decision according to our own discretion.

188
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:50,000
So other countries made the mistake of considering

189
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,480
India's non-aligned movements, its

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,440
tactics, its policies as our weakness.

191
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,360
But it was not like that.  We were

192
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,920

193
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,240
putting forward our own point of view.  If all this breaks out here

194
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,920
then assume that World War 3 will

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,800
begin.  But we will have to

196
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,040

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,279
understand the conditions of World War I and World War II.  Germany lost in the First World War

198
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,880
and

199
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,560
what did the European countries do to Germany?  An

200
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
economic

201
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,120
burden has been created that you have to

202
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,600
pay this much money.  Hitler was not there at that time.  The

203
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:33,120
money that was imposed on Germany at that time,

204
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,760
that debt was

205
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,640
repaid by Germany by 2010.  Such a long term

206
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,040
debt, such a huge debt was imposed on

207
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,760
Germany by the European countries or the Western countries.

208
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,920
Anyway, leave it.

209
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,399
Hitler was a child.  Hitler grew up and

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,320
joined Germany in 1933.

211
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,279
He became the head of state of Germany.  He was

212
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,920
understanding how I have to

213
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,360
take my country forward.

214
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,279
What actually happens?  Nationalism:

215
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,560
Nationalism is

216
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,680
a very thin line between you and your dictator.

217
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,839
Like Hitler was a great person, he was a

218
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,480
patriot.  Loved his country.

219
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,560
But he did not know when in that same patriotism

220
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
he turned into a dictator.

221
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,640
Nationalism becomes so dominant

222
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,120
that you do not care about the citizens of your country.  The

223
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,440

224
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,200
country becomes supreme for you

225
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:38,800
and that is what is called dictatorship.

226
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:42,320
Ok?  Now Hitler, in the year 1939, at

227
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,880
almost midnight in the year 1939, you can see

228
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,600
that around 3 pm,

229
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,720
Germany attacked Poland and took

230
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,120
complete control of Poland.  Gradually

231
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,120
he is further encouraging each country one by one.

232
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,079
Whatever is on it is invading it.

233
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,640
So Poland was captured first.

234
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,760
Also who was with Germany?  Mussolin was

235
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,800
from Italy.  He cooperated.  Now his next

236
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,880
target was Norway.  So

237
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,320
after Germany occupied Poland, he moved towards Norway.

238
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,200
Everything was fine.  He was gradually

239
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,360
expanding his empire.  Britain also

240
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
knew that this Germany is

241
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
not stopping.  Now I will tell you the comparative

242
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,000
stream, who is Germany right now

243
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,959
?  Who is made of what?  Let me

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,800
tell you right now.  So at that time Britain was

245
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,079
thinking about

246
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,720
how to ultimately defeat Germany.  But the thing is that being a human being,

247
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,440
he makes some mistake or the other due to which he develops

248
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,959
enmity with the lion while living in the jungle.

249
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,200
And this is what Hitler did.  Hitler

250
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,760
tried to invade Russia and this was

251
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,399
his biggest mistake.  Russian soldiers

252
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,760
drove away the German soldiers.  They

253
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,680
thought that we are a superpower.  We have

254
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,120
patriotism within us but

255
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,440
who can hold us back?  But Russia pushed

256
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,880
back the German soldiers.

257
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
Now here Germany realized

258
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,079
that there is a problem somewhere.  But

259
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,120
Germany made one more mistake.

260
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,079
What did Germany do that it targeted USA also?

261
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,600
Germany started targeting the USA saying that

262
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,160
now I will target this one.

263
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
But even before that, Germany,

264
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,600
Japan and Italy were in one camp.  Is

265
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,399
n't it?  Ok.  Ok.  During the Second World War,

266
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,120

267
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,639
Germany, Italy and Japan were in one camp.

268
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:38,639
What Japan did was that it attacked

269
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:41,200
Pearl Harbor of USA on 7th December 1941.

270
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,040

271
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
USA said, friend, I was not involved in the war.

272
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,760
Why are you attacking me forcefully, my friend

273
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,760
?  He said this thing will not be tolerated.

274
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,320
USA waited for the right time.

275
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,639
USA told Britain that we

276
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,279
support you.  Germany has to be shown its place.

277
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,519
So Britain and all these countries

278
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,320
together started invading Germany.

279
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,839
Brought Germany to its knees.  Then comes the turn

280
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,200
of Japan.  But now look,

281
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,079
understand carefully.  There is USA and there is Soviet Union.   There was a

282
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,600
battle of super power between these two as to

283
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,320
who ultimately is the super power.

284
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,519
Now Japan,

285
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,079
USA and Soviet Russia

286
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,639
could both have launched a nuclear attack on Japan,

287
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,639
just like Pearl Harbor happened.  But

288
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,920
who took advantage of it first?  The USA.  USA

289
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,200

290
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,399
dropped the bomb on Hirashima and Nagasaki in Japan.  Ok?  The bombs were

291
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,360
dropped on 6th August, 9th August 1945 in the

292
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,839
name of Little Boy and Fat Man,

293
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:49,120
everything was destroyed, the Second World War

294
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,839
also came to its knees,

295
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,720
Germany had lost over Japan,

296
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,240
Japan wanted to establish its dominance in Asia

297
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,399
that it would

298
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,839
become the super power in Asia but that dream remained unfulfilled

299
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,079
and who broke the dream, USA broke it.

300
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,880
Now what actually happened, as

301
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,639
soon as the Second World War happened, there

302
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,600
started a competition between USA and Soviet Union as to

303
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:16,079
who would ultimately rule the world.

304
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Therefore the whole world became bipolar.

305
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,480
what happened?  There are always two countries within a bipolar and a bipolar.

306
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,199
So bye means two,

307
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,720
here both Soviet and United States got

308
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,519
involved in the Cold War.  And the

309
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,880
Cold War will gradually end as

310
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,000
15 countries separate from Soviet Russia and its

311
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,320
power will reduce and the bipolar countries will

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,720
convert into unipolar countries and

313
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,920
who will become the leader? USA in 1991 is a

314
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,680
multipolar nation today.  The

315
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,760
whole world is multipolar.  No one is anyone's master.

316
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,560
Everybody does things their own way.  So

317
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,199
what was in the beginning?  Bipolar then unipolar now

318
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,920
multipolar.  I understood the story.  Now I will

319
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,440
change the characters in front of you.

320
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,600
Actually Russia

321
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,600
invaded Ukraine.  So let us assume that the war

322
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,519
started from there.  So

323
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
you can compare this with Germany's attack on Poland.

324
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,720
And

325
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,320
you guys must decide who Germany is.

326
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,079
You can do it easily.  So now the thing is that

327
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,959
Iran has replaced Japan.  Iran has taken Japan's place

328
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,519
and USA is at its place.

329
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,959
So, as soon as USA launches a nuclear attack,

330
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,360
it can be assumed that World War 3 will either

331
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,199
start or it will already have started

332
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,600
and will end as soon as the nuclear bomb

333
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,839
attack takes place.  Or else it will happen

334
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,399
that a nuclear bomb attack will occur and World

335
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,360
War 3 will break out.  India

336
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,920
, Pakistan, India, China, Taiwan,

337
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,240
Russia, Ukraine, all of them will join the war together along with

338
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,399
Israel etc.

339
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
and will get divided into their own factions as to

340
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,079
who is on whose side.  Because as the

341
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,800
results keep coming, for example, if the

342
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,800
results of China and Taiwan come, then Taiwan

343
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,880
or China will decide which way to go.

344
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,360
And already see, he will definitely go

345
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,279
towards Iran.  Isn't it?  Ok?  In

346
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,040
this way everyone will find their own place.

347
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,279
So you guys are living inside World War 3.

348
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,920
Congratulations to you all.  Ok

349
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,759
?  Now look, USA has a tremendous

350
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:19,199
Mother of All Bombs.  M O AB Mob M O

351
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,519
AB Mob Mother of all bombs, it was used by

352
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,600
America on Afghanistan.   The

353
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,680
US used it over Afghanistan on

354
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:31,440
April 13, 2013.

355
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,600
First of all, in Afghanistan, there are

356
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,279
so many bombs, the mother of all bombs, its

357
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,360
weight is 84,000 kg.

358
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,800
It holds so much weight and has been used many times.

359
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
America has used it not just once but many times.

360
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,680
Now America is thinking

361
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,160
why not drop the Mother of All Bombs

362
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,800
on whom?  Over Iran.  This would have a

363
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,880
huge impact and the whole of Iran would be shaken.   It should be

364
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,440
completely empty from there.  And all the countries should

365
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,000
understand that now we will have to

366
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,240
obey USA.  Ok?  So you

367
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,120
can see that when there was a mob attack in Afghanistan,

368
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,760
dozens of persons, dozens of

369
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,799
people, citizens, were killed in it.

370
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,919
So who can attack with this mob

371
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,400
?  America over Iran.  Ok

372
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,000
?  You guys will see it as well.  Along with this

373
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,559
you will see that Shock and Awe, which

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,199
is one of its techniques, was also adopted by USA.  He will

375
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,559
grow a little bit.

376
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,079
But let us take a cursory look at

377
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,480
what techniques USA had applied at that time.

378
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,120
Now look,

379
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,919
NATO and the NATO countries together will attack

380
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,400
Iran.  And

381
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,440
this world war will start against the countries that are allies of Iran.

382
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,720

383
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,960
What is the prospect of India now?

384
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,840
Former Indian envoy of India is saying that the

385
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
Israel-Iran conflict will never

386
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,039
convert into World War Three.  will

387
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,520
be.  This is a minor fight

388
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,600
in which America is trying to establish its dominance.  He is

389
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,080
looking for his own benefit.  He is

390
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,160
selling his weapons and has nothing else.

391
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,559
All of them are doing their own marketing.

392
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,960
Therefore, World War 3 is not going to happen.

393
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,880
This is what they say.  I have put the whole matter

394
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,640
before you.  Now you guys

395
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
tell me in the comment section whether there really is

396
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
World War 3.  Do you guys agree with

397
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,039
this or not?  Do you think

398
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,320
this will actually lead to World War 3

399
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,600
?  You guys must answer this for me.
