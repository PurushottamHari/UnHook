Friends, it is possible that you are living in the scenario of World War 3 right now and you may not be aware of it. When the war started in 1914 and 1939, people did not know that such a massive war would break out. Therefore, when the First World War took place from 1914 to 1918, it is called the Great War. And when the Second World War took place at that time people had understood that the dominance will remain with the country which has the power.  So it is possible that the scenario you are living in right now may be a scenario of World War 3. So when can we consider it to have started ?  We can consider its beginning from 2022.  I still remember the time when Russia invaded Ukraine after the Beijing Olympics ended and as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, you can consider it the beginning of World War 3. You can write this on a paper with your pen.  It started in 2022, 2023, 24, 25, today it has been 4 years. So we can consider its beginning from that time. Gradually a war begins. Like the First World War, like the Second World War, it lasted for four to five years and after that there was such an impact that the whole world completes the situation of that war , brings it under control , brings it under control and it begins that some countries surrender and some countries establish their dominance. So similarly, today we are going to talk about the scenario whether World War 3 can break out.  The biggest point of view that is emerging from this is that if Iran's nuclear facilities are targeted effectively by America, then this will mark the beginning of World War 3 and I will present some evidence and facts before you which will actually prove that World War 3 can start now because of Donald Trump leaving the G7 meeting midway and coming to America and saying that the conditions are very bad.  So let's talk about it - if USA targets Iran's nuclear facilities, will it trigger World War 3?  Will Tehran be targeted today in the same way that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were targeted in 1945 ?  If Nathansh, which is the centre of a nuclear facility for Iran, is targeted then we will say that World War 3 has started.  Let's talk about it, but right now Donald Trump has given 60 days to Iran, saying that you have 60 days and if even a day goes beyond 60 days, this will not be tolerated.  Why was this 60 days time given?  So that Iran can think whether it should sign the nuclear treaty or not.  Yes and no.  But no development was seen in between these 60 days and on the 61st day, this war was declared by Donald Trump saying, okay brother, if you are not ready to sign, then Israel will attack now. So that is considered to be the beginning of this war. But the thing is that against this, Operation Riseon was launched by Israel with the intention of attacking Iran because Iran had been using the Accession of Resistance for a very long time and was using the rebel groups, Hos, Hezbollah, Hamas, against Israel. When Israel started attacking Hamas, it completely destroyed the Gaza Strip. Israel attacked in such a manner that it gathered the people in the south of the Gaza Strip. Started distributing food there.  The children were dying of hunger.  So Israel distributed food at the place where they had to gather that population.  So that maximum children and women would gather in the South of Gaza Strip and the rest of Hamas fighters would gather in the North and Israel would be able to attack there easily.  So Israel did this as part of a very well thought out conspiracy.  Recently, in the attack which was carried out on Iran, the Mossad intelligence officers had already deployed the missiles there and after that, the attack was carried out under Operation Rising Lion, Iran also attacked in retaliation to this.  Now here there is a missile which is called Hellfire Missile, Ninja Hellfire Missile, it was given to Israel by USA and Israel used this missile in its drones. This missile is very powerful.  Once the target is locked, then assume that no matter how much the target moves, there will be no missile to hit it. So USA supplied weapons somewhere and after that this war broke out.  Now, the situation is such that if USA targets Iran with nuclear bombs, then it can be assumed that World War 3 will begin.  And congratulations, you guys are living inside World War Three.  Let me tell you how. First of all look at the world scenario to see what is happening where.  We start with Russia and Ukraine. So first of all the war broke out between Russia and Ukraine. Ok?  Russia wants to include Ukraine within its area by any means. So there is a war going on between the two. This is one condition going on here.   Let us lock it down.  Second, we go to China and Taiwan. So China and Taiwan, this is Taiwan. China is here.  This is Taiwan. Under the One China Policy, China wants Taiwan to be included within China. India supports Taiwan's two-state policy.  But China says that no, Taiwan is a part of it.  So, let us lock this as well. War is going on here too.  Third, we lock Israel and Iran.  Isn't it?  To Israel and Iran. What can we do to Israel and Iran ?  Let's lock it here. This is going on in two countries.  As well as within India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan.  Well, this war is not that big.  Pakistan made it look like a big war and even gave the information that it was a war with India which Pakistan won.  He recorded it in his history.  Think about it, for us it was an isolated incident, okay, terrorist incidents, blow up the terrorist hideouts, it was just for us.  Pakistan considers it a war.  Well, it doesn't matter, he is a child, he will understand.  In one situation, we locked it. We are locking these conditions. And see what other possibilities there are. You see that recently India's relations with Canada have deteriorated a lot.  So overall what this will do gradually is that it will spark towards World War 3.  Now America being America, what will it do? If he drops a nuclear bomb on Iran's nuclear facilities, Iran will be enraged and World War 3 will begin.  Now which country will stay with whom here?  So we will have to divide it into two factions.  There will be two sides in it: Access and Allies.  So, assume that if a war breaks out between India and Pakistan, then India will be busy in its own war. But how will he fare among others and other warriors?   It will remain separate.  will remain non-aligned.  Well, let me explain one thing to you very clearly that India being non-aligned is not India's weakness.  If India is not happy with the policies of USA.  The USSR is not happy with Russia's policies. If we are not happy with either the capitalist or the communist policies then what do we do?  We move away from them and say that we neither support them nor do we support them.  We are separate from ourselves.  It is non-aligned and it is not wrong to be non-aligned.  By remaining non-aligned we prove to ourselves that this is also not right.  This is also not right.  We will take the decision according to our own discretion. So other countries made the mistake of considering India's non-aligned movements, its tactics, its policies as our weakness. But it was not like that.  We were putting forward our own point of view.  If all this breaks out here then assume that World War 3 will begin.  But we will have to understand the conditions of World War I and World War II.  Germany lost in the First World War and what did the European countries do to Germany?  An economic burden has been created that you have to pay this much money.  Hitler was not there at that time.  The money that was imposed on Germany at that time, that debt was repaid by Germany by 2010.  Such a long term debt, such a huge debt was imposed on Germany by the European countries or the Western countries. Anyway, leave it. Hitler was a child.  Hitler grew up and joined Germany in 1933. He became the head of state of Germany.  He was understanding how I have to take my country forward. What actually happens?  Nationalism: Nationalism is a very thin line between you and your dictator. Like Hitler was a great person, he was a patriot.  Loved his country. But he did not know when in that same patriotism he turned into a dictator. Nationalism becomes so dominant that you do not care about the citizens of your country.  The country becomes supreme for you and that is what is called dictatorship. Ok?  Now Hitler, in the year 1939, at almost midnight in the year 1939, you can see that around 3 pm, Germany attacked Poland and took complete control of Poland.  Gradually he is further encouraging each country one by one. Whatever is on it is invading it. So Poland was captured first. Also who was with Germany?  Mussolin was from Italy.  He cooperated.  Now his next target was Norway.  So after Germany occupied Poland, he moved towards Norway. Everything was fine.  He was gradually expanding his empire.  Britain also knew that this Germany is not stopping.  Now I will tell you the comparative stream, who is Germany right now ?  Who is made of what?  Let me tell you right now.  So at that time Britain was thinking about how to ultimately defeat Germany.  But the thing is that being a human being, he makes some mistake or the other due to which he develops enmity with the lion while living in the jungle. And this is what Hitler did.  Hitler tried to invade Russia and this was his biggest mistake.  Russian soldiers drove away the German soldiers.  They thought that we are a superpower.  We have patriotism within us but who can hold us back?  But Russia pushed back the German soldiers. Now here Germany realized that there is a problem somewhere.  But Germany made one more mistake. What did Germany do that it targeted USA also? Germany started targeting the USA saying that now I will target this one. But even before that, Germany, Japan and Italy were in one camp.  Is n't it?  Ok.  Ok.  During the Second World War, Germany, Italy and Japan were in one camp. What Japan did was that it attacked Pearl Harbor of USA on 7th December 1941. USA said, friend, I was not involved in the war. Why are you attacking me forcefully, my friend ?  He said this thing will not be tolerated. USA waited for the right time. USA told Britain that we support you.  Germany has to be shown its place. So Britain and all these countries together started invading Germany. Brought Germany to its knees.  Then comes the turn of Japan.  But now look, understand carefully.  There is USA and there is Soviet Union.   There was a battle of super power between these two as to who ultimately is the super power. Now Japan, USA and Soviet Russia could both have launched a nuclear attack on Japan, just like Pearl Harbor happened.  But who took advantage of it first?  The USA.  USA dropped the bomb on Hirashima and Nagasaki in Japan.  Ok?  The bombs were dropped on 6th August, 9th August 1945 in the name of Little Boy and Fat Man, everything was destroyed, the Second World War also came to its knees, Germany had lost over Japan, Japan wanted to establish its dominance in Asia that it would become the super power in Asia but that dream remained unfulfilled and who broke the dream, USA broke it. Now what actually happened, as soon as the Second World War happened, there started a competition between USA and Soviet Union as to who would ultimately rule the world. Therefore the whole world became bipolar. what happened?  There are always two countries within a bipolar and a bipolar. So bye means two, here both Soviet and United States got involved in the Cold War.  And the Cold War will gradually end as 15 countries separate from Soviet Russia and its power will reduce and the bipolar countries will convert into unipolar countries and who will become the leader? USA in 1991 is a multipolar nation today.  The whole world is multipolar.  No one is anyone's master. Everybody does things their own way.  So what was in the beginning?  Bipolar then unipolar now multipolar.  I understood the story.  Now I will change the characters in front of you. Actually Russia invaded Ukraine.  So let us assume that the war started from there.  So you can compare this with Germany's attack on Poland. And you guys must decide who Germany is. You can do it easily.  So now the thing is that Iran has replaced Japan.  Iran has taken Japan's place and USA is at its place. So, as soon as USA launches a nuclear attack, it can be assumed that World War 3 will either start or it will already have started and will end as soon as the nuclear bomb attack takes place.  Or else it will happen that a nuclear bomb attack will occur and World War 3 will break out.  India , Pakistan, India, China, Taiwan, Russia, Ukraine, all of them will join the war together along with Israel etc. and will get divided into their own factions as to who is on whose side.  Because as the results keep coming, for example, if the results of China and Taiwan come, then Taiwan or China will decide which way to go. And already see, he will definitely go towards Iran.  Isn't it?  Ok?  In this way everyone will find their own place. So you guys are living inside World War 3. Congratulations to you all.  Ok ?  Now look, USA has a tremendous Mother of All Bombs.  M O AB Mob M O AB Mob Mother of all bombs, it was used by America on Afghanistan.   The US used it over Afghanistan on April 13, 2013. First of all, in Afghanistan, there are so many bombs, the mother of all bombs, its weight is 84,000 kg. It holds so much weight and has been used many times. America has used it not just once but many times. Now America is thinking why not drop the Mother of All Bombs on whom?  Over Iran.  This would have a huge impact and the whole of Iran would be shaken.   It should be completely empty from there.  And all the countries should understand that now we will have to obey USA.  Ok?  So you can see that when there was a mob attack in Afghanistan, dozens of persons, dozens of people, citizens, were killed in it. So who can attack with this mob ?  America over Iran.  Ok ?  You guys will see it as well.  Along with this you will see that Shock and Awe, which is one of its techniques, was also adopted by USA.  He will grow a little bit. But let us take a cursory look at what techniques USA had applied at that time. Now look, NATO and the NATO countries together will attack Iran.  And this world war will start against the countries that are allies of Iran. What is the prospect of India now? Former Indian envoy of India is saying that the Israel-Iran conflict will never convert into World War Three.  will be.  This is a minor fight in which America is trying to establish its dominance.  He is looking for his own benefit.  He is selling his weapons and has nothing else. All of them are doing their own marketing. Therefore, World War 3 is not going to happen. This is what they say.  I have put the whole matter before you.  Now you guys tell me in the comment section whether there really is World War 3.  Do you guys agree with this or not?
