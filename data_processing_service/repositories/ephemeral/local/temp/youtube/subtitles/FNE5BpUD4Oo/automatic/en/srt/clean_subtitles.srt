I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  Okay, the attack has happened and now my analysis on this will be whether this is going to be World War 3?  Sir will say today about World War 3.  Hey, what should I say? What should I do brother?  I just want the war to happen. But it's my job to tell you things.  Be prepared because in my opinion this is the greatest point of escalation after World War 2.  This is the biggest escalation.  Let me tell you.  So what was being said was, will World War 3 happen?  There is a huge possibility that a world war may or may not happen but a huge regional war can take place. Why could this happen?  Because America has attacked Israel and America and Israel together have attacked Iran.  What was feared happened.  And friends, let me tell you that the possibility was so much that the whole world was telling America not to do it.  And the people of America were also saying, don't do it, it will calm down on its own.  Look, Iran has missiles.  It is being told that they currently have two missiles.  Those those he hasn't used yet.  And the interceptors that Israel has may run out very soon.  Its report had also come.  But friends, nothing like this is going to happen because everyone will give money to Israel. He will get a lot of money and money keeps coming to him anyway.   Is it okay?  Jews control the money of the entire world. So there wo n't be any problem regarding money like this.  Israel can continue this war for a long time.  Iran can also last longer. But America's entry into Iran will cause a big problem.  So let us see which big countries are standing with whom.  Ok? So first of all let us talk about our India.  See what is India's stand. India has no stand.  And now friends, India will have to take some stand.  We can't means we can't suck.  We can't do this, this is our choice, it will get messed up.  So we have to choose, we cannot be alone this time we have to make the choice because Iran opened its airspace for Indians.  Thousands of Indians were saved.  Now Iran's envoys are saying that India will have to help Iran.  Iran has no choice.  This Russia-Ukraine thing, you must remember that Ukraine reminded India of everything from Chanakya to Mahabharata that you should help us.  So this is what Iran is doing. But I don't think India will help Iran.  However, India and Iran have very good relations.  Very good relations, we also have Parsis here, they had migrated from Persia only. You can believe that he is such a talented person in India, he is carrying the entire economy on his shoulders.  But despite all this, there are historical connections.  Everything is fine, everything is great.  Iran and India, India is probably with Iran because we have better relations with Israel right now. And in a way, if we condemn Iran, Israel will get angry. We should not forget that under Operation Sindoor, Iran had said that it would do mediation.  I did not condemn it.   In fact all of Shabaz Sharif brothers had reached Iran.  Ok?  This is how geopolitics works.  But Israel was the only country that stood with India.  Now if India stands with Israel then that is also not right.  Because, as we said, we have investments in Iran. Chabahar Port.  Many students study there.  There is people to people contact.  There is a historical relationship.  Ok?  So this is a very big dilemma for India. what will he do?  India will obviously remain no-lead. Brother, Iran has even said that if you call yourself the global leader of the South , you say that you lead, then you should do this work.  This means that Iran has in a way unofficially recognised India that if you are the leader of the South, then help us.  Ok?  But India has a very correct strategy. India says for peace, brother there should be peace, there should be tranquility, there should be tranquility.  So that is why we stay away from war.  If we chose even one site, we would be in a war.  And if we enter the war, then brother, it will be ours only and no one else's.   So that is why India remains a little away, which is a good thing.  But now, friends, the time is such that you will have to choose one country or the other.  But that is not the right time now.  So at present India's stand is to stay away from this war.  Maybe it might help indirectly.  Now who will he do it to?  Who will Iran, Israel do that to?  This is going to be a very big geopolitical decision and it will change everything. Ok?  But as far as I am concerned, India will stay away from it.  Then after that come to China and Russia, son.  Well, China and Russia.  China has openly come out in support of Iran.  Is it okay?  He is openly supporting Iran.  He is saying that we will do everything for Iran.  This means that China could enter the war. Now see, America has actually entered the war.  Now this war was between Israel and Iran. Now America entered the war. Now do you know what will happen with this?  What will happen due to this is that Iran will now attack everything, this Gulf State here, meaning Persian Gulf, whatever you say, whoever is there, will start attacking the State of Hormuz, the Red Sea will start attacking, the oil prices may rise, gas prices may rise, energy crisis could come and after that, there will be an attack on all the air bases of America that are built here, there is no defense system there, so they will start attacking them, so this will become a very big problem, which means, in a way, it is an attack on the sovereignty of America and if there is an attack on the sovereignty of America, then the entire Europe is standing behind America.  He has to remain standing. He has no choice.  America brother, look to whom the world order went to get oil.  The one who has power in the world and also has the rules of life.  Acharya Chanakya had also said that whoever has power will rule.  He will make the rules only.  That is why India has to work on its own strengths.  Today America has power.  India had it once upon a time. But today America has the power, so it is ruling.  So brother, this entire region of Europe will stand with America. Germany has said that Israel and France are doing dirty work.  Ok ?  Whatever it is, but look, Don Trump is not a country.  Donald Trump is a man. America is a complete country.  Is it okay?  Now look, I told you the same thing, although only one person took the decision to attack. And now Donald Trump is saying that either there will be peace or it will be very tragic for Iran. That means the war is huge and global.  After that Iran itself has issued a warning. I haven't even said this. Iran itself has said that now this war will become regional.  Now this war will become regional.  That means, this Gulf area, where one crore people from India live, all of them are scared.  Is everyone okay?  There could be massive attacks here and after that they too can jump into the war as attacks are not planned with any prior notice. So this whole region can get destabilized.  If we talk about Russia, then Russia may indirectly support Iran now. But Vladimir Putin had said that look, when he was asked this, he clearly said that look, if he had taken away our defence system.  Now everyone is talking about business, so everything would be fine. He should have taken S400. Although S300 has been given to them by Russia, it has become very old.  It is from the time of Baba Adam.  And you are seeing the consequences of this, that he could not save Iran.  Now what has happened is that Russia is saying this, Vladimir Putin is saying that look, we will stay away from this for now.  Indirectly he clearly said that they had made a strategic partnership in January but there was nothing related to defence in it.  But China is a very important factor because China has come together with Iran here and it has openly supported it. So you can see that on one side there is America.  Ok?  And this Africa listens to America and China. China has dominance in many places.  In many places America dominates Europe.  Is it okay ?  Same is the case with South America.  So basically the fight here is between America, Europe versus Iran, China and Russia. And India is far from this.  So all these Western Nations or West El, it would be better to call them NATO.  They will all stand with America at this time.  And even out of fear. Now see, Don Trump keeps saying again and again that he even told NATO that brother, we will not give money even to NATO.  So everybody is scared.  So they also feel that it is our moral responsibility to support America and Israel also exists. So friends, this war can spread.  This means that China might jump in. North Korea gave troops to Iran, North Korea gave troops to Russia.  The news came that 25,000 North Korean soldiers were killed. North Korea can also provide its soldiers to Iran.  Is it okay?  North Korea is also a nuclear nation.  Now look at Pakistan, even Pakistan is involved in this.  It has never happened like this, but America held a meeting with Pakistan and you know that Pakistan is right next to Iran. America will come and sit here and he will directly sit in America's lap, which Iran does not like at all.  Iran will remember all these things.  Ok?  But look, America has entered.  Now suppose what I am saying does not happen. Ok?  So then this war may happen within three to four days because now Iran does not have any choice and it is possible that now America may invite Iran, America may enter Iran or the regime may actually change, America may sit and Khomeini may be killed, it is possible that brother Donald Trump may say this, we know all their locations, so it is possible that America can do this, but if China or Russia or Iran attacks anywhere, then it will be a very big regional war, okay?  If this war is only between America, Israel and Iran.  Now look, according to me the wise thing would be that Iran should take action even though Iran has given a warning.  But Iran must be left alone.  He said, okay you have carried out a nuclear attack.  Now let's sit at the table. You have finished it.  You became happy.  The nuclear side was destroyed.  My ego was satisfied.  Now come and sit at the table. This would be good for the peace and stability of the region. Otherwise this whole world will jump into war.  Because this time friends, a side has been taken. No sides were taken in Ukraine or Russia.  Ok?  China has openly supported Iran.  Why have you given support?  Because all the energy from Iran is going to China.  Ok? China also has significant investment in Iran. And this access to Iran, China, Russia , right?  Whatever you call Axis of EV or Axis of Resistance, this brother is a matter of great concern for the whole world. Who made Iran and Saudi Arabia friends?  China. So this entire energy game of China is a big game plan, it is not that China loves Iran a lot.  Ok?  Actually, Iran should love India because we have historical relations.  But this work that is going on is about energy, business and transaction of money.  This is the main reason.  So let's see what happens next.  Ok?
