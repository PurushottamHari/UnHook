1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,080
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,880
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,200
Welcome to Study Gloss.  Okay, the

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,679
attack has happened and now

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,120
my analysis on this will be whether this is going to be World

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,880
War 3?  Sir will say today about

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,400
World War 3.  Hey, what should I say?

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,880
What should I do brother?  I just want the war to happen.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,920
But it's my job to tell you things.  Be

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,279
prepared because in my opinion

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,840
this is the

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,719
greatest point of escalation after World War 2.  This

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,320
is the biggest escalation.  Let me tell you.  So what was being

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,120
said was, will World War

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
3 happen?  There is a huge possibility

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,520
that a world war may or may not happen

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
but a huge regional war can take place.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,399
Why could this happen?  Because America has attacked

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,879
Israel and America and Israel together have

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
attacked Iran.  What was feared

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,800
happened.  And friends, let me tell you that the

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,120
possibility was so much that the whole world was

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,600
telling America not to do it.  And the

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,000
people of America were also saying, don't do it, it

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,079
will calm down on its own.  Look, Iran has

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,720
missiles.  It is being told that they

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,840
currently have two missiles.  Those those

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,680
he hasn't used yet.  And the

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,119
interceptors that Israel has may run

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,960
out very soon.  Its report had also

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,479
come.  But friends, nothing like this is going to happen

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
because everyone will give money to Israel.

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,720
He will get a lot of money and

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
money keeps coming to him anyway.   Is it

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,159
okay?  Jews control the money of the entire world.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,080
So there wo

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,240
n't be any problem regarding money like this.  Israel

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,439
can continue this war for a long time.  Iran can also last longer.

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,200
But America's entry into Iran will cause a

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,200
big problem.  So let us

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,000
see which big countries are

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,720
standing with whom.  Ok?

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,200
So first of all let us talk about our

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,960
India.  See what is India's stand.

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,560
India has no stand.  And now

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,079

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,479
friends, India will have to take some stand.  We can't means we can't

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,479
suck.  We can't do this, this is our choice,

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,439
it will get messed up.  So we have to

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,119
choose, we cannot be alone this time we have to

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,680
make the choice because Iran

52
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,119
opened its airspace for Indians.  Thousands of

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,720
Indians were saved.  Now Iran's

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,959
envoys are saying that India will have to

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,480
help Iran.  Iran has

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,959
no choice.  This Russia-Ukraine thing, you must remember

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,879
that Ukraine reminded India of everything from Chanakya to

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,599
Mahabharata

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,360
that you should help us.  So this is what Iran is doing.

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,080
But I don't think India

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
will help Iran.  However, India and Iran have

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,920
very good relations.  Very good relations,

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we also have Parsis here,

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
they had migrated from Persia only.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,360
You can believe that he is such a

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,560
talented person in India, he is carrying the entire economy

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,239
on his shoulders.  But despite all this, there

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,400
are historical connections.  Everything is fine, everything is

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
great.  Iran and India, India is

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
probably with Iran because we have

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,680
better relations with Israel right now.

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,280
And in a way, if we

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,879
condemn Iran, Israel will get angry.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,959
We should not forget that

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,879
under Operation Sindoor, Iran had said that it would do

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,840
mediation.  I did not condemn it.   In

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,560
fact all of Shabaz Sharif brothers had

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,560
reached Iran.  Ok?  This is how geopolitics

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
works.  But Israel was the only

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
country that stood with India.  Now if

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,560
India stands with Israel then that is also

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
not right.  Because, as

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,760
we said, we have investments in Iran.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Chabahar Port.  Many students

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,959
study there.  There is people to people contact.  There

86
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,120
is a historical relationship.  Ok?  So this

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,599
is a very big dilemma for India.

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,159
what will he do?  India will obviously remain no-lead.

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,040
Brother, Iran has even said

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,959
that if you call yourself the global leader of the South

91
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,440
, you say that you lead,

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,280
then you should do this work.  This means that Iran has in

93
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,200
a way unofficially

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,319
recognised India that if you

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,360
are the leader of the South, then help us.  Ok?  But

96
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,080
India has a very correct strategy.

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,400
India says for peace, brother there should

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
be peace, there should be tranquility, there should be tranquility.  So that is why we

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,640
stay away from war.  If we chose even one site,

100
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,480
we would be in a war.  And if we

101
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,439
enter the war, then brother, it will be ours only

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,000
and no one else's.   So

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,799
that is why India remains a little away,

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,280
which is a good thing.  But now,

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,760
friends, the time is such that you will have to

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,920
choose one country or the other.  But that is

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,560
not the right time now.  So at present India's stand is to

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,720
stay away from this war.  Maybe it might

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,880
help indirectly.  Now

110
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,519
who will he do it to?  Who will Iran, Israel do that to?  This is

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,440

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,880
going to be a very big geopolitical decision and it will change everything.

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Ok?  But as far as I am concerned,

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,960
India will stay away from it.  Then after that

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
come to China and Russia, son.  Well, China

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,479
and Russia.  China has

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,880
openly come out in support of Iran.  Is it okay?  He

118
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,120
is openly supporting Iran.  He is

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,520
saying that we will do everything

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,000
for Iran.  This means that China could enter the war.

121
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,720
Now see, America has actually

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,639
entered the war.  Now this war was between Israel and Iran.

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,960
Now America entered the war.

124
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,000
Now do you know what will happen with this?  What will happen due to this is that

125
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,479
Iran will now attack everything,

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,360
this Gulf State here, meaning Persian Gulf, whatever you

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,440
say, whoever is there, will start

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,160
attacking the State of Hormuz, the

129
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,840
Red Sea will start attacking, the oil

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
prices may rise, gas prices may

131
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
rise, energy crisis could come

132
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,919
and after that, there will be an attack on all the air bases of America that are

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
built here, there is no

134
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,919
defense system there, so they will

135
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,360
start attacking them, so this will become a very big

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,360
problem, which means, in a way, it

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,600
is an attack on the sovereignty of America and if there is an

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
attack on the sovereignty of America, then the

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,360
entire Europe is

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,880
standing behind America.  He has to remain standing.

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
He has no choice.  America brother,

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,280
look to whom the world order went to

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,880
get oil.  The one who has power in the world and

144
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,520
also has the rules of life.  Acharya Chanakya had also

145
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,479
said that whoever has power

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,880
will rule.  He will make the rules only.  That is why India has to

147
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,120
work on its own strengths.  Today America has

148
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
power.  India had it once upon a time.

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,039
But today America has the power, so it is

150
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,960
ruling.  So brother,

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
this entire region of Europe will stand with America.

152
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,479
Germany has said that

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Israel and France are doing dirty work.  Ok

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,720
?  Whatever it is, but look, Don Trump is

155
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,199
not a country.  Donald Trump is a man.

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,280
America is a complete country.  Is it okay?  Now

157
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
look, I told you the same thing, although only

158
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,840
one person took the decision to attack.

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,160
And now Donald Trump is saying that

160
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,680
either there will be peace or it will be very tragic for Iran.

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
That means the war is huge and

162
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
global.  After that Iran itself has issued a warning.

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
I haven't even said this.

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,199
Iran itself has said that now

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,520
this war will become regional.  Now this war will

166
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,160
become regional.  That means, this Gulf

167
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,120
area, where one crore

168
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,479
people from India live, all of them are scared.  Is

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,720
everyone okay?  There could be massive attacks here

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
and after that they too can jump into the war

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
as attacks are not planned with any prior notice.

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,639
 

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,120
So this whole region

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,199
can get destabilized.  If we talk about Russia, then Russia

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,280
may indirectly support Iran now.

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,360
But Vladimir Putin had said that

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,880
look, when he was asked this,

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,319
he clearly said that look, if he had

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
taken away our defence system.  Now everyone is talking about business,

180
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
so everything would be fine.

181
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,080
He should have taken S400.

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Although S300 has been given to them by Russia, it has become

183
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
very old.  It

184
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
is from the time of Baba Adam.  And you are seeing the consequences of this, that

185
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,599
he could not save Iran.  Now

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
what has happened is that Russia is saying this,

187
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,880
Vladimir Putin is saying that look, we will

188
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
stay away from this for now.  Indirectly

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
he clearly said that

190
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,680
they had made a strategic partnership in January

191
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
but there was nothing related to defence in it.  But

192
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,919
China is a very important factor

193
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,560
because China has come together with

194
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,880
Iran here and it has openly supported

195
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,199
it.

196
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,120
So you can see that on one side there

197
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,440
is America.  Ok?  And this

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,440
Africa listens to America and China.

199
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,000
China has dominance in many places.  In many

200
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,560
places America dominates Europe.  Is it okay

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,720
?  Same is the case with South America.  So

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,759
basically the fight here is between America,

203
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,120
Europe versus Iran, China and Russia.

204
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,919
And India is far from this.  So all

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,720
these Western Nations or West El, it would be

206
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,240
better to call them NATO.  They will all

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
stand with America at this time.  And even out of fear.

208
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
Now see, Don Trump keeps saying again and again that

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
he even told NATO that

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
brother, we will not give money even to NATO.  So

211
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,400
everybody is scared.  So they also feel

212
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,400
that it is our

213
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,960
moral responsibility to support America and Israel also exists.

214
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,160
So friends, this war

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,520
can spread.  This means that China might jump in.

216
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,520
North Korea gave troops to Iran, North Korea

217
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,680
gave troops to Russia.  The news came that

218
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,280
25,000 North Korean soldiers were killed.

219
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
North Korea can also provide its soldiers to Iran.  Is it

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,919
okay?  North Korea is also

221
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,000
a nuclear nation.  Now

222
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,319
look at Pakistan, even Pakistan is involved in this.  It has

223
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,080
never happened like this, but

224
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,000
America held a meeting with Pakistan

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
and you know that Pakistan is

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
right next to Iran.

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,599
America will come and sit here and he will directly

228
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,800
sit in America's lap, which

229
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,120
Iran does not like at all.  Iran will

230
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,080
remember all these things.  Ok?  But

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,519
look, America has entered.  Now

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,720
suppose what I am saying does not happen.

233
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,560
Ok?  So then this war may happen within three to four

234
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,760
days because now Iran does

235
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,080
not have any choice and it is possible that now America may

236
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,320
invite Iran, America may enter

237
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Iran or the regime may actually change,

238
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,480
America may sit and Khomeini may be killed, it is

239
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
possible that brother Donald

240
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,519
Trump may say this, we know all their locations, so it is

241
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,240
possible that America can do

242
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,480
this, but if China or Russia

243
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,399
or Iran attacks anywhere, then it will be

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
a very big regional war,

245
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
okay?  If this war is only between America, Israel

246
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
and Iran.  Now look,

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,399
according to me the wise thing would be that Iran should take action even though

248
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,160
Iran has given a warning.  But Iran

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
must be left alone.  He said, okay you have carried out a

250
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,160
nuclear attack.  Now let's sit at the table.

251
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,920
You have finished it.  You became happy.  The

252
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,640
nuclear side was destroyed.  My ego was

253
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,200
satisfied.  Now come and sit at the table.

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,560
This would be good for the peace and stability of the region.

255
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,560
Otherwise this whole world will

256
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,200
jump into war.  Because this time

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,000
friends, a side has been taken.

258
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,959
No sides were taken in Ukraine or Russia.  Ok?  China has

259
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,040
openly supported Iran.  Why have you

260
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,760
given support?  Because all the energy from Iran is

261
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,360
going to China.  Ok?

262
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,160
China also has significant investment in Iran.

263
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,240
And this access to Iran, China, Russia

264
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,040
, right?  Whatever you call Axis of EV or Axis of

265
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
Resistance, this brother is a

266
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,040
matter of great concern for the whole world.

267
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,680
Who made Iran and Saudi Arabia friends?  China.

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,519
So this entire energy game of China is a

269
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,079
big game plan, it is not that China

270
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,680
loves Iran a lot.  Ok?  Actually,

271
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,959
Iran should love India because we have

272
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,760
historical relations.  But this work that is

273
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,760
going on is about energy, business and

274
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:30,800
transaction of money.  This is the main reason.  So

275
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:33,120
let's see what happens next.  Ok?  And you can try

276
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,640
this great combo of Chanakya Niti plus Personality Development.  The

277
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,480

278
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,480
link is given in the description comment box.  Thank you so

279
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,480
much.
