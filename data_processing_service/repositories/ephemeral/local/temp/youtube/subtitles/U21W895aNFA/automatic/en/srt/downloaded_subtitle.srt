00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,480
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,200
Prashant Dhawan. Now Donald J Trump, US

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,280
President has openly placed his demand before Iran. He has

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,880

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,240
openly said in front of the entire world that I want unconditional

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,720
surrender. I want Iran to accept defeat.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,119
In written form, I mean here we are

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
talking about the manner in which India made

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,679
Pakistan surrender

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,000
in the 1971 India-Pakistan war.

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,079
Donald Trump wants such images and of course, at the same time, he would

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,160
definitely like to change this regime.

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
And you will listen to Donald Trump's words,

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,239
I will also have to say a little that it does

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,480
not seem that a world leader is

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,920
writing all this.  He also said

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,079
that we know very well

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,800
where this so-called supreme leader of Iran is hiding; use

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,680
such language even if it is an enemy country.  That

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,879
means we have seen in history that

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,520
overall leaders do not openly use such language against each

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,440
other.  But

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,560
Trump is openly saying where is the supreme leader

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,520
hiding?  I know it.  He is an easy

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,760
target.  But it is saved there.  We are not

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,880
going to take him out.  And what does take him out

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,520
mean?  Kill means that for now they

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,680

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
can easily kill the Supreme Leader of Iran if they want.  But he is not killing me.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,600
At least for now.  We do not want the

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,000
missile to kill civilians or

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,159
American soldiers.  This tweet is

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,119
very important.  Does this mean that

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,600
American soldiers have already

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,840
reached Iran on the ground?  Are

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,920
US Marines already active in Iran?  I was

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,560
recently watching a video

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,400
of a trade cruise.  He is a senior leader of the Republican Party in the US and is

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
very

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,680
close to Donald Trump.  During an interview it came out of his mouth

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
that yes, USA is already

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,079
bombing Iran.  Listen to this part.   It

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,799
is a small part of a few seconds.  It will come

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,719
out from their mouth that we mean we are already carrying

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,040
out strikes

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,040
on Iran.

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,879
Now they said that we are already attacking

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
Iran.  He said, we

49
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,879
thought that Israel was attacking.  Yes

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
yes Israel is doing it but with our help.

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,760
So again the question here is

52
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,239
that they do not want

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,800
missiles to fall on American soldiers.  Does this mean

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
that they are afraid that Iran will

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,360
attack American bases or what will happen?  This

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,080
is a very interesting statement by the US

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,200
President.  And he also

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,319
said that we now have complete and total

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,080
control over the sky of Iran.  Now when he

60
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,319
says this he is obviously talking about both the US and Israel.

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
So the US

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,879
is very involved today.  The US was

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
earlier telling the story that no, we are

64
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
not involved.  We did not attack anything.

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,360
Well, these are involved today.   He

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
further says that Iran's sky

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,840
trackers and defensive equipment were very

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
good.  But

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,959
nothing can stand in front of American made defense equipment.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,800
Nobody does it better.  And if you are thinking here

71
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,319
that Trump's statements are

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,400
quite worrying.  What will happen if China and Russia jump in to

73
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
help Iran?  For now, let

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
me tell you that at the age of

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,879
now, when I am recording the video,

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
I do not know about the future if some major

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,000
changes happen but for now, it seems that

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,480
Russia has given up on Iran; this was the

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,360
end of their journey, till then they had given

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,040
missile defence systems, primarily S300

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
missile defence systems, apart from that they had

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,760
given Mig planes etc. to Iran but

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,239
beyond that Russia is not seen doing anything at this time, no Russian

84
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
soldiers are

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,640
coming to save Iran, the way

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,360
Russia saved Syria,

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,599
during the time of Barack Obama from USA,

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
Russia is not going to come to save Iran.  Here you will see that

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,560
many articles are being written

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,480
today on why Russia is hesitating

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,879
from helping Iran.  Now

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,599
look again some of you might

93
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,280
say.  Look, when Russia

94
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,480
saved Syria, around 2016-17,

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,560
if we look at that time, Russia was

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,560
not involved in the war with Ukraine.  The situation

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
was different.  Russia had options so

98
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
they saved Bashar al-Assad's government.

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,280
But at this time Russia itself is entangled

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,000
with Ukraine.  How did these people

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,280
come to help Iran?  Well you can say that

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,519
but still I believe that when the

103
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,520
bombing started on Tehran itself, Russia should have

104
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,560

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,960
sent some help to help Iran.  Interestingly,

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,880
now the Americans are saying that Russia is

107
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,360
very busy in Ukraine.  Russia does

108
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,800
n't seem to be going to do anything.  But China

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,080
may strike the US and US LI.

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Yes, the same China about which Trump has

111
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,160
given a statement in Canada that

112
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,120
include them in G9, expand G7,

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,400
include Russia and China,

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,560
make a G9 group, about the same China, Godon

115
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Chang is a very important defense

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
strategist of the US and I completely agree with

117
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,479
Godon Chang's statement, if you

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,720
look at various geopolitical reports, the

119
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,199
same indication is being given there that China will

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
jump into this war somewhere or the other if the

121
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,000
situation continues to worsen in this manner

122
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,280
and especially

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,680
if the US and Israel directly

124
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,000
target Iran's supreme leader Khamenei.  Now all these developments are

125
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,919
very worrying in themselves if you ask me.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,960
But then the name Mike Huckabee

127
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,560
comes in the news.  Look, this is the US

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,400
Ambassador to Israel.  Let's tweet this one thing.

129
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,960
Actually they send a message

130
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,440
to Don Trump and Trump

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,360
displays this message to the whole world.

132
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,440
In this message Mike Huckabee says

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,720
that Donald Trump, you have a golden opportunity to

134
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,800
make your name in history.  In the same

135
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,479
way in the year 1945, President Harry

136
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
Truman, the President of USA at that time was

137
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,320
Harry Truman.  He had made a big

138
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,479
decision that changed everything.

139
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,960
Here you will see that it is written, No

140
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,680
President in my lifetime has been in a

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,000
position like yours not since Harry True

142
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,720
Man.  So this is saying that absolutely you have

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,120
a great opportunity and I believe in you.

144
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,000
You will make a big decision here and

145
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,639
remind them that up in heaven,

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,720
you know you were chosen.  That's why

147
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,759
you were saved from that bullet.  There was definitely some divine

148
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,759
intervention.  And now it is your job to

149
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,080
not let our flag bow down.  Our

150
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,880
flag will not come down and you will

151
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,240
show by taking a big decision.  Now when people

152
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,720
saw this, everyone scratched their heads and

153
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720
people connected it with the history and saw

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,960
what was being said here.  See, Harry Truman,

155
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
who was the US President, is remembered

156
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,520
because he was the US President

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,240
who gave approval to the US

158
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,120
military to go and drop the atomic bomb

159
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,919
on Hirashima Nagasaki and after that, as

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,759
you all know, for some time the

161
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,039
Japanese military

162
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,599
showed some resistance but very soon

163
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,759
after that Japan surrendered and World War 2

164
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,120
ended.  Now the question that arises here is

165
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,599
that Harry Truman in 1945, this was

166
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,919
right before the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan

167
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,440
and you will see many Americans

168
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,919
highlighting this

169
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,880
on the social media today, are Trump's

170
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,960
advisors telling Trump to wage a

171
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,199
nuclear war here, you know,

172
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,919
drop the nuclear bomb here on Iran

173
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:30,000
or are they saying don't drop the nuclear bomb, do

174
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,400
such bombing that the world is stunned

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,360
and everyone

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,080
says with folded hands that now don't do any more violence.   It's

177
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
enough.  And looking at the current plans of USA and Israel, it

178
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,720
seems that the bombing of Tehran and

179
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,440
other cities of Iran is going to

180
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,120
increase further.  Trump himself is going to make a

181
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
big statement very soon, related to Iran.

182
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Most likely

183
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,280
this statement will come today during the day or at night.

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,520
And now the question is,

185
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,759
what big decision is Donald Trump going to take

186
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,280
regarding Iran?  Because their

187
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,240
demand is of unconditional surrender, this

188
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,400
usually happens only when,

189
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,080
in our case, if I talk as an Indian, we

190
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,479
broke Pakistan into two parts, only then

191
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,560
this happened when you literally broke a

192
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,599
country, meaning half the population of Pakistan was

193
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,520
wiped out by these people in 1971, if something like that

194
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,919
happens only then this country says that okay

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,440
we are doing unconditional surrender, and

196
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
after that we also did

197
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,759
a lot of damage to these people in West Pakistan, so is the

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,479
US going to launch an extraordinary attack

199
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,919
on Iran, is this Trump's plan that

200
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,120
I will damage Iran in such a way that

201
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,719
now, you know, their morale will be broken.  They will just

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,680
stop fighting.  And now look, I have to

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,440
add this here also.  It is very risky to walk on this path.

204
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,720
Now here you will say

205
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,959
what is the risk?  Suppose Russia suddenly

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
wakes up.  Putin says no no, I will not

207
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,200
tolerate it.  This won't happen to the Supreme Leader.

208
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,360
Suddenly the news comes that

209
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,839
Russian soldiers are landing in Iran.

210
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,519
Chinese soldiers are landing in Iran.

211
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
Suddenly such news starts coming.   Do

212
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,800
n't be surprised if this happens,

213
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,120
this can very much happen.  And suddenly Donald

214
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,600
Trump has to step back.  Donald Trump

215
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,680
says no, now look, if only Chinese and

216
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,640
Russian soldiers were killed here, then the matter will go somewhere

217
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,040
else and after all that, Iran is saved

218
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,080
here, then Iran will become the hero of the entire Muslim world.

219
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,120
Actually,

220
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,720

221
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,040
Iran will become the poster child of all the anti-US forces. Many countries including Israel, US

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,440

223
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,600
tried to destroy Iran, kept it in the grace of FATF for many years,

224
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,080
then literally started bombing,

225
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,200
killed the nuclear scientists, even then

226
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,519
Iran tolerated it, it tolerated everything, so this will be

227
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,800
very interesting to see, the coming few

228
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,120
hours will tell us

229
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,200
what will be written in the pages of history, history is being

230
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,160
made here, as updates come, I will

231
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,920
keep bringing updated videos for you.  Look,

232
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,000
I believe that if you are

233
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,240
not using Artificial Intelligence

234
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,120
in your work today, then you are living in a different era

235
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,519

money.  You can upskill yourself.

238
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
For example, if I

239
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,800
want to show that Captain America is

240
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240

241
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,399
eating Vada Pav in a busy street of Mumbai and above it is written a very

242
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
attractive text 'Yummy', then

243
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,000
I can easily do this by entering the right prompt.

244
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,040

you can make many variants of It was just that easy.
