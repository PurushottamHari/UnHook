Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now Donald J Trump, US President has openly placed his demand before Iran. He has openly said in front of the entire world that I want unconditional surrender. I want Iran to accept defeat. In written form, I mean here we are talking about the manner in which India made Pakistan surrender in the 1971 India-Pakistan war. Donald Trump wants such images and of course, at the same time, he would definitely like to change this regime. And you will listen to Donald Trump's words, I will also have to say a little that it does not seem that a world leader is writing all this.  He also said that we know very well where this so-called supreme leader of Iran is hiding; use such language even if it is an enemy country.  That means we have seen in history that overall leaders do not openly use such language against each other.  But Trump is openly saying where is the supreme leader hiding?  I know it.  He is an easy target.  But it is saved there.  We are not going to take him out.  And what does take him out mean?  Kill means that for now they can easily kill the Supreme Leader of Iran if they want.  But he is not killing me. At least for now.  We do not want the missile to kill civilians or American soldiers.  This tweet is very important.  Does this mean that American soldiers have already reached Iran on the ground?  Are US Marines already active in Iran?  I was recently watching a video of a trade cruise.  He is a senior leader of the Republican Party in the US and is very close to Donald Trump.  During an interview it came out of his mouth that yes, USA is already bombing Iran.  Listen to this part.   It is a small part of a few seconds.  It will come out from their mouth that we mean we are already carrying out strikes on Iran. Now they said that we are already attacking Iran.  He said, we thought that Israel was attacking.  Yes yes Israel is doing it but with our help. So again the question here is that they do not want missiles to fall on American soldiers.  Does this mean that they are afraid that Iran will attack American bases or what will happen?  This is a very interesting statement by the US President.  And he also said that we now have complete and total control over the sky of Iran.  Now when he says this he is obviously talking about both the US and Israel. So the US is very involved today.  The US was earlier telling the story that no, we are not involved.  We did not attack anything. Well, these are involved today.   He further says that Iran's sky trackers and defensive equipment were very good.  But nothing can stand in front of American made defense equipment. Nobody does it better.  And if you are thinking here that Trump's statements are quite worrying.  What will happen if China and Russia jump in to help Iran?  For now, let me tell you that at the age of now, when I am recording the video, I do not know about the future if some major changes happen but for now, it seems that Russia has given up on Iran; this was the end of their journey, till then they had given missile defence systems, primarily S300 missile defence systems, apart from that they had given Mig planes etc. to Iran but beyond that Russia is not seen doing anything at this time, no Russian soldiers are coming to save Iran, the way Russia saved Syria, during the time of Barack Obama from USA, Russia is not going to come to save Iran.  Here you will see that many articles are being written today on why Russia is hesitating from helping Iran.  Now look again some of you might say.  Look, when Russia saved Syria, around 2016-17, if we look at that time, Russia was not involved in the war with Ukraine.  The situation was different.  Russia had options so they saved Bashar al-Assad's government. But at this time Russia itself is entangled with Ukraine.  How did these people come to help Iran?  Well you can say that but still I believe that when the bombing started on Tehran itself, Russia should have sent some help to help Iran.  Interestingly, now the Americans are saying that Russia is very busy in Ukraine.  Russia does n't seem to be going to do anything.  But China may strike the US and US LI. Yes, the same China about which Trump has given a statement in Canada that include them in G9, expand G7, include Russia and China, make a G9 group, about the same China, Godon Chang is a very important defense strategist of the US and I completely agree with Godon Chang's statement, if you look at various geopolitical reports, the same indication is being given there that China will jump into this war somewhere or the other if the situation continues to worsen in this manner and especially if the US and Israel directly target Iran's supreme leader Khamenei.  Now all these developments are very worrying in themselves if you ask me. But then the name Mike Huckabee comes in the news.  Look, this is the US Ambassador to Israel.  Let's tweet this one thing. Actually they send a message to Don Trump and Trump displays this message to the whole world. In this message Mike Huckabee says that Donald Trump, you have a golden opportunity to make your name in history.  In the same way in the year 1945, President Harry Truman, the President of USA at that time was Harry Truman.  He had made a big decision that changed everything. Here you will see that it is written, No President in my lifetime has been in a position like yours not since Harry True Man.  So this is saying that absolutely you have a great opportunity and I believe in you. You will make a big decision here and remind them that up in heaven, you know you were chosen.  That's why you were saved from that bullet.  There was definitely some divine intervention.  And now it is your job to not let our flag bow down.  Our flag will not come down and you will show by taking a big decision.  Now when people saw this, everyone scratched their heads and people connected it with the history and saw what was being said here.  See, Harry Truman, who was the US President, is remembered because he was the US President who gave approval to the US military to go and drop the atomic bomb on Hirashima Nagasaki and after that, as you all know, for some time the Japanese military showed some resistance but very soon after that Japan surrendered and World War 2 ended.  Now the question that arises here is that Harry Truman in 1945, this was right before the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan and you will see many Americans highlighting this on the social media today, are Trump's advisors telling Trump to wage a nuclear war here, you know, drop the nuclear bomb here on Iran or are they saying don't drop the nuclear bomb, do such bombing that the world is stunned and everyone says with folded hands that now don't do any more violence.   It's enough.  And looking at the current plans of USA and Israel, it seems that the bombing of Tehran and other cities of Iran is going to increase further.  Trump himself is going to make a big statement very soon, related to Iran. Most likely this statement will come today during the day or at night. And now the question is, what big decision is Donald Trump going to take regarding Iran?  Because their demand is of unconditional surrender, this usually happens only when, in our case, if I talk as an Indian, we broke Pakistan into two parts, only then this happened when you literally broke a country, meaning half the population of Pakistan was wiped out by these people in 1971, if something like that happens only then this country says that okay we are doing unconditional surrender, and after that we also did a lot of damage to these people in West Pakistan, so is the US going to launch an extraordinary attack on Iran, is this Trump's plan that I will damage Iran in such a way that now, you know, their morale will be broken.  They will just stop fighting.  And now look, I have to add this here also.  It is very risky to walk on this path. Now here you will say what is the risk?  Suppose Russia suddenly wakes up.  Putin says no no, I will not tolerate it.  This won't happen to the Supreme Leader. Suddenly the news comes that Russian soldiers are landing in Iran. Chinese soldiers are landing in Iran. Suddenly such news starts coming.   Do n't be surprised if this happens, this can very much happen.  And suddenly Donald Trump has to step back.  Donald Trump says no, now look, if only Chinese and Russian soldiers were killed here, then the matter will go somewhere else and after all that, Iran is saved here, then Iran will become the hero of the entire Muslim world. Actually, Iran will become the poster child of all the anti-US forces. Many countries including Israel, US tried to destroy Iran, kept it in the grace of FATF for many years, then literally started bombing, killed the nuclear scientists, even then Iran tolerated it, it tolerated everything, so this will be very interesting to see, the coming few hours will tell us what will be written in the pages of history, history is being made here, as updates come, I will keep bringing updated videos for you.  Look, I believe that if you are not using Artificial Intelligence in your work today, then you are living in a different era because with the help of AI, you can do many jobs.
