00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello Friends.  Friends, amidst the Israel-Iran

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,400
war, one of the things which has become a big

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,120
concern and is being

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,719
discussed a lot is whether the

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,120
attack by Israel on Iran's nuclear

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,120
facilities has led to any

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,279
kind of radioactive

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,600
leak?  And let me tell you that the

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,680

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,640
confirmed to the United Nations Security Council and said that

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,359
Israel's strike on Iran cost

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
radioactive and chemical leak.  Yes, there has been a

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,239
chemical and radioactive leak.  But at

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,399
what level has this leaked?  Where has it leaked

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,320
?  In what way did this happen?

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
I will tell you all this in detail.  Can this

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
become a danger for Iran?  You will

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,920
get to know a lot.  First of all,

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,680
you have to understand a little bit of background here.

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
Look, you all know that Israel

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,480
launched Operation Rising Line, a very

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,039
large scale military operation.  And it is being said that

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,199
since 1967 such a big

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,920
operation has been conducted by Israel

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,160
and more than 200 critical

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,320
points of Iran were attacked.  Now

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,199
see, attacks have taken place at many places like

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,680
military bases, command bunkers, red radar

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,119
stations.  But the most important thing that is being

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
discussed is

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,880
nuclear facilities.  And

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,799
if you look at the nuclear facilities, there is a

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,280
lot of discussion about three.  And

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,560

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,960
you will see this just below the capital of Iran, Tehran.  Fado Nataj and

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
Iftihan.  So here the fact will be

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,200
related to your exam perspective.  In order to make arrangements, he will

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
say that arrange the nuclear facilities from North to South or South to

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
North.

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,280
So

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,840
keep in mind, first there is Fardo on top, then Nasanj

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
and here you will see Ifan.  So the

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
attacks that Israel carried out, these

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
attacks are continuing, these attacks are being carried out on nuclear facilities.

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,360
And that is why there is

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,079
particular concern here about the Nathans

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,479
Uranium Enrichment Facility.  This

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,280
Nataj Uranium Enrichment Facility that you are seeing in the middle,

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,399
a very big attack took place there

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,520
due to which

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,600
a lot of infrastructure above the facilities above the ground has been

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,000
damaged and because of this, a

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,159
leak is being reported there.  Well, what did Rafael Grossi, the

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,959
Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency,

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,680
say?  They have basically sent this formal report

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
to the UNSC.  This

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,440
is obligatory.  I will tell you what its rules

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
say?  What reports do they have to

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
send to IAA?  But see

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,080
what he has said in his report?  Following

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Israeli air strikes on the Natanz facility

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,160
we have confirmed internal radioactive and

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,480
chemical contamination at the site.  So they are

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,360
confirming that radioactive and

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,920
chemical contamination has occurred at the site.  Because

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,400
of Israeli attack.  And this is probably the first time

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,120
in history that you will see that

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,080

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,160
a nuclear site has been damaged due to an attack because of war.  And the

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
question here is,

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,200
what type of leak is this?  What is its nature?   Is there

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,120
any danger to us from this?  So

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,599
first of all let me tell you as far as the radio

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,080
logical leak is concerned.  This

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,959
basically happened inside the plant.  Meaning there

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
is an internal leak.  It is present inside the

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,680
damaged facility.  And what type of

80
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,519
radiation has leaked?  Alpha radiation leak and the

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
chemical leak being talked about here

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,800
are industrial grade toxic

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,280
chemicals used in the uranium enrichment

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,360
process.  So you all know

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,840
what Iran is doing right now?  Uranium enrichment is being carried out

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,239
continuously so that 90%

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,560
purity can be achieved and nuclear weapons can be made.

88
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
So the

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,879
toxic chemicals

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,879
used in the uranium enrichment process have also leaked here.

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,280
And this leak again keep in mind that

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,599

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,640
nothing can be said right now about the external radiation in the complex.

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,400
Meaning, whatever is the normal level of external

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,480
leak, that is what is being told.  Meaning there is no

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,760
worry externally as of now.  But

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,599
this leak has definitely happened inside the plant.

98
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
Now the question is

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,920
how did this happen?  Look, first of all you should

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,480
know about the facility that Nathan is.  The

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,879
Natanj facility has been

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,720
built underground.  Meaning you will get to see it a little below the ground.  In

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,519
fact, you should keep one thing in

104
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,400
mind that this Fardo facility is

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,120
very deep down,

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,120
you will find it somewhere around 80 to 90 meters below the mountain.  So

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,879
this is quite safe.  It is going to be

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,720
very tough for Israel to destroy it.

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,799
But the new facility is

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,639

111
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,479
available just below the ground.  So here in fact I will

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,720
also show you pictures.  This

113
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,320
is such a facility.  It has been made and again

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
in this picture also you will be

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,880
able to see it clearly in the satellite picture.  So one thing to

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,320
understand here is that your centrifuge components are

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,240
above the ground.  But

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
you will find the main nuclear facility

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,320
underground.  So

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
what happens here is that there is some support system.

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,880
Centrifuge components like

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,800
control cooling, vacuum pumps,

123
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,040
electrical control are done.  So these kind of

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
things, as you can see

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
here, are above the ground.  As

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,360
you can see the infrastructure.  So

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,080
basically it is being said here that the

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,800
structure which was built above the ground has been

129
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,320

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
destroyed due to the Israeli air strike.  In fact, let me

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,800
show you satellite pictures again.

132
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
You can see this picture of the Natazh Enrichment Complex which was

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
released

134
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,320
by Israel and you can clearly see

135
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,880
how extensive damage has occurred here.

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,039
So basically, when this air strike happened, the

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,520
structures above the ground housing the

138
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,080
enrichment control system got damaged.

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,560
And because of this there is basically power loss.

140
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,520
Due to power loss, the active

141
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,919
centrifuge cascade was shut down.

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,479
And the reason for the shutdown is

143
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,800
said to be chemical exposure that was

144
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,080
triggered from uranium

145
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,080
hexafluoride (UFC), which is also called Uranium Hexafluoride,

146
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,560
and remember that it is toxic and

147
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,960
radioactive.  So here we need to

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,840
understand one more thing that this UFC,

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,840
Uranium Hexafluoride, is

150
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,080
not externally dangerous for us.  But if we

151
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,160
inhale it and it enters our body

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,000
then it becomes dangerous for us.

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Meaning, we are basically

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
talking about alpha radiation.  The

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,120
radiation monitor here showed a

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,759
spike in alpha radiation inside the plant, which is

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,639

158
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,400
used in uranium processing.  So it does

159
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
not cause any harm outside our body.  But when

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,560
we inhale it and it enters our body

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
then it becomes dangerous for us.

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
So looking at this you will be

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,080
able to see that the response from IAEA has

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,720
come here.  First of all he said that we are

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,560
directly

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,479
in contact with the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran.

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
And see, it is very important

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
that if IAEA is not in contact with them, then

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
we will not be

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,960
able to know exactly what has leaked and at what level.

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,960
And it is also very important for Iran

172
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,520
because in the future, if

173
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,000
things go beyond the dangerous level, then

174
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,800
ultimately only IAEA will be useful in containing it.

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,280
So here in fact, IAEA chief

176
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Grossi also offered to Iran

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,759
that we can send our inspection team persons

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,000
on the ground.  But

179
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,080
perhaps Iran has not allowed it yet.

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
And at the same time, Grossi also warned the

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,160
United Nations Security Council that

182
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
the way nuclear facilities are being

183
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
attacked here, it is dangerous

184
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,039
President.  And here he says that an

185
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,520

186
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,759

187
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,000
attempt is being made to breach the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970.

188
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,680
It should not happen.  Well,

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
know about IAEA also.  It means

190
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,479
International Atomic Energy Agency which is

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,080
affiliated with the United Nations.  It is an autonomous

192
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,720
organization but is affiliated with the UN.

193
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,479
It was built in 1957.

194
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
Its head quarter

195
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,039
is in Vienna, Australia.  And its main purpose is that

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,520
nuclear energy should be used for peaceful use.

197
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,120
Meaning we

198
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,440
take electricity etc. but the

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,199
military purpose should be prevented.

200
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,039
So this is their main purpose.

201
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
If you look at their function, these people basically

202
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,280
verify the nuclear materials

203
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,199
so that it is not diverted for weapons programs.

204
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,120
North Korea Iran do not use it.

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,759
Apart from this, it is also sent for inspections.

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,400
Here so that compliance

207
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,280
can be checked.  Apart from this, this IAAE

208
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,080
also helps the developing countries on

209
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,240

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,479
how to use nuclear energy in medicine, agriculture, water, energy

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,560
and along with this, the global standard regarding

212
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
safety at nuclear power plants is

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,240
also decided by them.   Apart from this,

214
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
whatever findings

215
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,720
etc. occur here, these people send reports to the UN

216
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,560
Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations.

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639

218
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
So that is why they have just

219
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,400
sent this report to the United Nations

220
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,039
Security Council.  Well,

221
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,840
what is the relation between IAEA and NPT here?

222
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,479
Basically, the members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty that was signed

223
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,960

224
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,519
decided that whatever verification etc. would be done regarding

225
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,919
nuclear weapons would be the responsibility of the IAEA.

226
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,560
So they were allowed to do this

227
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,000
and at the same time nuclear technology should

228
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,480
be for only peaceful purposes and hence the

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
responsibility for this was given to IAEA.

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,959
Well ultimately now the question arises

231
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,040
that whether it has been said about a leak or has it leaked

232
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,880
inside, yes, the thing is that it has

233
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,279
leaked inside the structure, so

234
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,279
what is its implication for Iran? The first

235
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
thing is that the centrifuge operation

236
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,399
in the Nataaj facility will have to be definitely

237
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,640
halted and the

238
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
biggest danger for the workers is that the workers who are

239
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,360
inside that facility will get

240
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,600
chemical exposure for their health, it is a huge risk

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,600
for them and apart from this, Iran, as I

242
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,279
told you, has

243
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
not yet called them for the IAEA inspection.  If the team has

244
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,880
not been called then that also becomes important.

245
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,959
If we look from a long term perspective, there will be

246
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,279

247
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,760
a lot of delay in construction here again.  Iran's enrichment

248
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,240
capability has suffered a huge setback

249
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,320
and Israel also wanted us to

250
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
attack their nuclear sites.   The

251
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
domestic political pressure is also going to

252
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
increase inside Iran and

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
along with it international sympathy can also be added

254
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,920
because whenever it comes to nuclear etc.

255
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
then definitely you will

256
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
see sympathy with it.  Because

257
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,519
a lot can be known through this.  But keep one thing in

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,839
mind, here you need to understand one thing

259
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,560
that even if Israel attacks, it is

260
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,720
not likely that a

261
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,080
major nuclear calamity will occur because of this.  The

262
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
reason for this is that simply when you attack or hit any

263
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,480
nuclear material or nuclear

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,959
equipment with a

265
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,880
conventional weapon,

266
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,640
it does not result in any nuclear explosion.

267
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,760
Like a nuclear bomb was exploded.

268
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,680
It doesn't happen like that.  Meaning, there is

269
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,240
no danger here that any such nuclear

270
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,160
bomb will explode.  But yes, the thing is that the

271
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,560
localized dispersal here, as I

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,640
told you, the situation at the local level

273
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,640
can be quite serious.  Again it

274
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,279
depends on what kind of configuration of

275
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,440
nuclear material is there inside the facility

276
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,200
?  What I mean to say is, are

277
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,440
nuclear material and

278
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,519
explosives

279
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,440
kept together?  If both are kept separate,

280
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,120
nuclear material and explosives, then

281
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,279
there is really no danger.  But if

282
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,360
both of them are kept together and then you attack,

283
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,440
then the chances of a leak

284
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,959
increase significantly.  So we will have to see

285
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,200
what happens next regarding this.  But definitely

286
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,200

287
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I thought I should tell you about the concerns expressed by the IAEA and if

288
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,360
any more detailed news comes about this

289
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
then I will make a video for you.

290
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
Before leaving, a very interesting question can

291
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
you tell India is a member of

292
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
which of the following nuclear and

293
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,399
export control regimes? You have to tell out of these four

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
and the right answer to this, you

295
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,360
all know, it will be available on my Instagram,

296
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,279
if you are not there, no problem, you

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,399
can get its correct answer from Twitter and

298
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,160

me.  I was like it, it won't happen, let's leave it.  If it is

341
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,959
not happening then what is the use of

reading them again and again?

343
