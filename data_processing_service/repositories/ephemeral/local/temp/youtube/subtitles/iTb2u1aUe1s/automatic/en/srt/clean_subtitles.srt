Hello Friends.  Friends, amidst the Israel-Iran war, one of the things which has become a big concern and is being discussed a lot is whether the attack by Israel on Iran's nuclear facilities has led to any kind of radioactive leak?  And let me tell you that the Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed to the United Nations Security Council and said that Israel's strike on Iran cost radioactive and chemical leak.  Yes, there has been a chemical and radioactive leak.  But at what level has this leaked?  Where has it leaked ?  In what way did this happen? I will tell you all this in detail.  Can this become a danger for Iran?  You will get to know a lot.  First of all, you have to understand a little bit of background here. Look, you all know that Israel launched Operation Rising Line, a very large scale military operation.  And it is being said that since 1967 such a big operation has been conducted by Israel and more than 200 critical points of Iran were attacked.  Now see, attacks have taken place at many places like military bases, command bunkers, red radar stations.  But the most important thing that is being discussed is nuclear facilities.  And if you look at the nuclear facilities, there is a lot of discussion about three.  And you will see this just below the capital of Iran, Tehran.  Fado Nataj and Iftihan.  So here the fact will be related to your exam perspective.  In order to make arrangements, he will say that arrange the nuclear facilities from North to South or South to North. So keep in mind, first there is Fardo on top, then Nasanj and here you will see Ifan.  So the attacks that Israel carried out, these attacks are continuing, these attacks are being carried out on nuclear facilities. And that is why there is particular concern here about the Nathans Uranium Enrichment Facility.  This Nataj Uranium Enrichment Facility that you are seeing in the middle, a very big attack took place there due to which a lot of infrastructure above the facilities above the ground has been damaged and because of this, a leak is being reported there.  Well, what did Rafael Grossi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, say?  They have basically sent this formal report to the UNSC.  This is obligatory.  I will tell you what its rules say?  What reports do they have to send to IAA?  But see what he has said in his report?  Following Israeli air strikes on the Natanz facility we have confirmed internal radioactive and chemical contamination at the site.  So they are confirming that radioactive and chemical contamination has occurred at the site.  Because of Israeli attack.  And this is probably the first time in history that you will see that a nuclear site has been damaged due to an attack because of war.  And the question here is, what type of leak is this?  What is its nature?   Is there any danger to us from this?  So first of all let me tell you as far as the radio logical leak is concerned.  This basically happened inside the plant.  Meaning there is an internal leak.  It is present inside the damaged facility.  And what type of radiation has leaked?  Alpha radiation leak and the chemical leak being talked about here are industrial grade toxic chemicals used in the uranium enrichment process.  So you all know what Iran is doing right now?  Uranium enrichment is being carried out continuously so that 90% purity can be achieved and nuclear weapons can be made. So the toxic chemicals used in the uranium enrichment process have also leaked here. And this leak again keep in mind that nothing can be said right now about the external radiation in the complex. Meaning, whatever is the normal level of external leak, that is what is being told.  Meaning there is no worry externally as of now.  But this leak has definitely happened inside the plant. Now the question is how did this happen?  Look, first of all you should know about the facility that Nathan is.  The Natanj facility has been built underground.  Meaning you will get to see it a little below the ground.  In fact, you should keep one thing in mind that this Fardo facility is very deep down, you will find it somewhere around 80 to 90 meters below the mountain.  So this is quite safe.  It is going to be very tough for Israel to destroy it. But the new facility is available just below the ground.  So here in fact I will also show you pictures.  This is such a facility.  It has been made and again in this picture also you will be able to see it clearly in the satellite picture.  So one thing to understand here is that your centrifuge components are above the ground.  But you will find the main nuclear facility underground.  So what happens here is that there is some support system. Centrifuge components like control cooling, vacuum pumps, electrical control are done.  So these kind of things, as you can see here, are above the ground.  As you can see the infrastructure.  So basically it is being said here that the structure which was built above the ground has been destroyed due to the Israeli air strike.  In fact, let me show you satellite pictures again. You can see this picture of the Natazh Enrichment Complex which was released by Israel and you can clearly see how extensive damage has occurred here. So basically, when this air strike happened, the structures above the ground housing the enrichment control system got damaged. And because of this there is basically power loss. Due to power loss, the active centrifuge cascade was shut down. And the reason for the shutdown is said to be chemical exposure that was triggered from uranium hexafluoride (UFC), which is also called Uranium Hexafluoride, and remember that it is toxic and radioactive.  So here we need to understand one more thing that this UFC, Uranium Hexafluoride, is not externally dangerous for us.  But if we inhale it and it enters our body then it becomes dangerous for us. Meaning, we are basically talking about alpha radiation.  The radiation monitor here showed a spike in alpha radiation inside the plant, which is used in uranium processing.  So it does not cause any harm outside our body.  But when we inhale it and it enters our body then it becomes dangerous for us. So looking at this you will be able to see that the response from IAEA has come here.  First of all he said that we are directly in contact with the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. And see, it is very important that if IAEA is not in contact with them, then we will not be able to know exactly what has leaked and at what level. And it is also very important for Iran because in the future, if things go beyond the dangerous level, then ultimately only IAEA will be useful in containing it. So here in fact, IAEA chief Grossi also offered to Iran that we can send our inspection team persons on the ground.  But perhaps Iran has not allowed it yet. And at the same time, Grossi also warned the United Nations Security Council that the way nuclear facilities are being attacked here, it is dangerous President.  And here he says that an attempt is being made to breach the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970. It should not happen.  Well, know about IAEA also.  It means International Atomic Energy Agency which is affiliated with the United Nations.  It is an autonomous organization but is affiliated with the UN. It was built in 1957. Its head quarter is in Vienna, Australia.  And its main purpose is that nuclear energy should be used for peaceful use. Meaning we take electricity etc. but the military purpose should be prevented. So this is their main purpose. If you look at their function, these people basically verify the nuclear materials so that it is not diverted for weapons programs. North Korea Iran do not use it. Apart from this, it is also sent for inspections. Here so that compliance can be checked.  Apart from this, this IAAE also helps the developing countries on how to use nuclear energy in medicine, agriculture, water, energy and along with this, the global standard regarding safety at nuclear power plants is also decided by them.   Apart from this, whatever findings etc. occur here, these people send reports to the UN Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations. So that is why they have just sent this report to the United Nations Security Council.  Well, what is the relation between IAEA and NPT here? Basically, the members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty that was signed decided that whatever verification etc. would be done regarding nuclear weapons would be the responsibility of the IAEA. So they were allowed to do this and at the same time nuclear technology should be for only peaceful purposes and hence the responsibility for this was given to IAEA. Well ultimately now the question arises that whether it has been said about a leak or has it leaked inside, yes, the thing is that it has leaked inside the structure, so what is its implication for Iran? The first thing is that the centrifuge operation in the Nataaj facility will have to be definitely halted and the biggest danger for the workers is that the workers who are inside that facility will get chemical exposure for their health, it is a huge risk for them and apart from this, Iran, as I told you, has not yet called them for the IAEA inspection.  If the team has not been called then that also becomes important. If we look from a long term perspective, there will be a lot of delay in construction here again.  Iran's enrichment capability has suffered a huge setback and Israel also wanted us to attack their nuclear sites.   The domestic political pressure is also going to increase inside Iran and along with it international sympathy can also be added because whenever it comes to nuclear etc. then definitely you will see sympathy with it.  Because a lot can be known through this.  But keep one thing in mind, here you need to understand one thing that even if Israel attacks, it is not likely that a major nuclear calamity will occur because of this.  The reason for this is that simply when you attack or hit any nuclear material or nuclear equipment with a conventional weapon, it does not result in any nuclear explosion. Like a nuclear bomb was exploded. It doesn't happen like that.  Meaning, there is no danger here that any such nuclear bomb will explode.  But yes, the thing is that the localized dispersal here, as I told you, the situation at the local level can be quite serious.  Again it depends on what kind of configuration of nuclear material is there inside the facility ?  What I mean to say is, are nuclear material and explosives kept together?  If both are kept separate, nuclear material and explosives, then there is really no danger.  But if both of them are kept together and then you attack, then the chances of a leak increase significantly.  So we will have to see what happens next regarding this.  But definitely I thought I should tell you about the concerns expressed by the IAEA and if any more detailed news comes about this then I will make a video for you. Before leaving, a very interesting question can you tell India is a member of which of the following nuclear and export control regimes? You have to tell out of these four and the right answer to this, you all know, it will be available on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from Twitter and friends, let me tell you that till tomorrow 15th June, Study IQ's Great Learning Festival is going on, means if you are preparing for any of the UPSC, want to take the UPSC batch, then definitely take our Pratigya batch for 2026 because there are many features in it.
