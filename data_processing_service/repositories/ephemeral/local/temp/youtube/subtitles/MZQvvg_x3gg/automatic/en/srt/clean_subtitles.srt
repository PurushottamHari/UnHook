[Music] Ladies and gentlemen, the American dollar is a ticking time bomb. You know, in 1923, after Germany lost the World War I, the German government was forced to pay $33 billion in reparations. 1923 was disastrous for Germany. In that year, French and Belgian troops entered the ruer to force the Germans to pay up. The Allies presented the London schedule of payment. The final war reparations bill, which they expected that Germany would pay, the total, which the Germans had negotiated down from previous offers, was 132 billion gold marks. So, you know what they did? They started printing money. And when they started printing money, Germany unlocked an economic horror story that they would remember for a century. The German currency became so worthless, so worthless that in 1921, $1 was equal to 70 German marks. But by the end of 1924, $1 was equal to 4.2 trillion German marks. Money was so worthless that people literally burned cash for fire because firewood was more valuable than the currency they were burning. Because of the enormous reparation cost to be paid in gold, there was no longer any backing for the mark. As the mark lost value, the government printed more money. The German middle class was the worst hit. People would be paid in the morning and have suitcase fulls of banknotes and they would have to then run to the shops because the time when they bought their goods, their food, the prices would have risen. A loaf of bread cost 2 billion marks. A pound of butter cost 2 trillion marks. Unemployment, hunger, and a hopeless future distinguished the Wymer Republic to the German people. And the same thing happened in Zimbabwe also when they printed money to get out of their economic crisis. Zimbabwe's hyperinflation hit 89.7%. Yes, 89.7% as in 89.7 followed by 20 freaking zeros. the announcement by the central bank that it has launched three new additional nodes, one for 250,000, 500,000 and 750,000. The country's economy has now become one of the world's worst food production and agricultural exports dropped drastically. Now the economy is blighted by hyperinflation and joblessness. Difficult to get basic food commodities and many people are having to go into neighbor country to buy flour, sugar and even cooking oil. Life is tough in Zimbabwe. bread lines are a common sight. Similarly, when Venezuela printed money, hyperinflation hit 1 million%. So, what does history tell us? History tells us that every time a country prints a lot of money to get out of economic crisis, they face an economic horror due to hyperinflation. But here's where it gets insane. You know, in April 2020 alone, the United States of America created $3 trillion. And this is where economists believe that the dollar could be turning into a ticking time bomb. Why? Because the US debt today is over $36 trillion, which is more than the GDP of India, China, Russia, UK, and Japan combined. 36 36 36 trillion. That's the debt. 36 trillion. It's a ticking time bomb. And according to the IMF, it is ticking louder than ever. The International Monetary Fund, it has issued a direct warning. Without exaggeration, American debt is a ticking time clock. $25 trillion of new debt on top of the $36.2 trillion we have now, which is already the most debt of any country in the world that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. But somehow, do you realize there is no hyperinflation in the US? The US economy is not collapsing at all. And the United States seems to be progressing no matter what they do. And this is why ladies and gentlemen, the American dollar could be a ticking time bomb that could one day destroy the entire world economy. So the question is, even after creating so much money, why is America not experiencing hyperinflation? Can America simply keep on creating money without any worry at all? And how on earth is the world still trusting the US dollar in spite of all this madness? Before we move on, let me thank outskill for supporting our content.

[Music] In the current situation, like we saw, the United States has $36 trillion in debt with $1 trillion just going into interest payments. And like we discussed in our previous case study, they have crossed their debt ceiling 70 times since 1960. In fact, in 2020 2021, the United States created around $3 trillion. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday the US hit the 31.4 4 trillion borrowing cap set by Congress. With the potential for US economic catastrophe, raising the debt ceiling has historically been a routine and bipartisan act. The debt ceiling has been revised 78 times since 1960. This is about economic stability versus economic chaos. So, how do Americans just make $1 trillion out of thin air using their dollar power? Well, this is how the money machine of the dollar works. Step number one, the Federal Reserve, which is America's central bank, it creates $500 billion of new money to buy bonds. Now, mind you, this money is not handed over to the citizens. Neither is it physically printed. This money is created digitally. Then comes step number two. The Federal Reserve buys $500 billion worth of 10-year bonds from commercial banks at, let's say, 1% interest. So, Bank A sells $150 billion in bonds, bank B sells $200 billion in bonds, and bank C sells $150 billion in bonds. So, the Fed credits these banks with $500 billion in new reserves, all digitally created. Then comes step number three. Now that banks have 500 billion in fresh reserves, they start lending more money to businesses and consumers. So, bank A lends $50 billion to businesses and bank B lends $und00 billion for mortgages and Carlos. And this sudden flood of money allows banks to lower interest rates from 5% to 3%. Why? Because the supply of money is very high. And then comes step number four which is where the economic cycle starts moving. So what happens in this cycle? An example of the same would be the fact that the developers would borrow more money to build homes. So while they build homes, they would hire workers, plumbers, electricians and laborers. Similarly, as home buyers keep on getting loans, they would buy properties, they would buy furniture and they would buy several other things which will keep the economic cycle moving and eventually more people will work, more people will earn and more people will spend. And when the spending goes up, asset appreciation happens. And this is where step number five comes into play. As demand rises for real estate and consumer goods, stock prices go up, property prices go up, and most importantly, the government's tax revenue starts going up. And just like that, the US government uses digital money to reduce its burden and keep the economic flywheel running. But now this begs another question. If Zimbabwe, Germany, Venezuela, Turkey, all of them faced hyperinflation after printing money, why hasn't the US faced hyperinflation yet? Well, as it turns out, whenever the US is in trouble, the global market somehow comes together just to save the United States of America. Sounds shocking, right? Well, let's go back to 2021 and you'll understand the story very well. When the pandemic hit in 2020, the American economy came to a standstill. So, the US government injected $3 trillion over 2 years. And as soon as that happened, three things followed. Firstly, Americans had more money. The businesses had more money. The consumers spent more and the company started growing. Eventually, the economic cycle started spinning and the economy started growing. Secondly, the US dollar depreciated. But the catch over here is that when the US dollar goes down in value, US goods and oil becomes cheaper in the global market. So, the global demand for American exports and oil goes up. For example, if the dollar weakens, avocado becomes cheaper globally. And what happens when avocado becomes cheaper? countries start importing more avocados. And since the US dollar is the world's reserve currency, central banks all around the world hold dollars in their reserves. And most global trade like oil, gold, wheat is still settled in dollars. So when the dollar drops, everybody still needs the dollar, which means the demand comes roaring back because no matter what happens, everybody needs oil because oil eventually fuels the growth of any economy. So in 2021 as the dollar depreciated the demand for oil shot up and this rising demand brought back the value of dollar on track and this happened very very quickly and then to make matters better for America in 2022 the Russia Ukraine war broke out and when the war broke out what happened the world started to panic Ukraine's capital city of Keev is under attacks between Russia and the west are growing rapidly President Biden has ordered several thousand US troops to take up new positions in Eastern Europe. The attacks on Ukraine has clearly rattled global markets as well, sending stocks tumbling. Big move we've seen is in the price of oil. Crude oil prices now close to $100 a barrel. Energy prices and volatility would likely spike even higher in the European Union, which relies, as we know, heavily on Russia. When the world started to panic, what happened? investors started selling assets from all over the globe and ran back to the United States to park their money in the US market. Why? Because even in curios, the US dollar is the safest asset on the planet. And the same thing happened in 2008 also after the US injected billions of dollars, the dollar dipped in value. But somehow the world recovered and the demand for dollar spiked again and eventually Europe got hit with debt crisis because of which again investors panicked and they ran back to the US and parked their money in the US dollar. Why? Because whenever chaos happens the US dollar is the safest asset to invest in. So after all this chaos when the demand for dollar rises again the Federal Reserve quietly steps in and raises the interest rates and tightens the money supply to cool the things off. So if you look at the pattern, what's happening over here guys? When the US is in an economic crisis where it has no other option, they literally create money in order to save themselves from an economic crisis. When they create money, the value of the dollar tips. But when the value of the dollar dips because the world trades with the dollar, they need more oil, they need more avocados, and they need more gold. So when this trade increases, the demand for dollar rises. And when the demand for dollar rises, this dip in the dollar value comes back again because of which the dollar comes back to its original value. And somehow every time the United States deploys quantitative easing to create billions and trillions of dollars, although the dollar value dips in short term, somewhere or the other there is an economic crisis because of which the investors flood back to the US and park their money in dollars. And when the investors pour in billions and trillions of capital into the US market and buy the US dollar, the dollar demand increases and the dollar comes back to track. And all of this happens because the world trade happens with dollars. Why? Because everybody in the world trusts the US dollar. So ladies and gentlemen, do you realize the real power does not lie with the US army or the Silicon Valley. It lies with the US dollar. And more importantly, it lies with the trust that the world places on the US dollar. Because if Turkey starts printing money, nobody wants the LRA. Why? Because nobody buys oil in Turkish LRA and nobody trusts the Turkish LRA. Similarly, if Venezuela starts printing money, nobody trusts the Venezuelan currency because even if you have billions and trillions of Venezuelan currency, nobody's going to give you oil in exchange for Venezuelan currency. So it doesn't really matter whether it is Germany, Turkey or Venezuela. If they start printing money, even if you have billions and trillions of these countries currency, it will be worthless because nobody will sell you oil in exchange for these currencies. So the dollar and the trust of the dollar is by far the most powerful asset that the United States has. So here's the moral of the story. As long as the world buys oil in dollars, as long as dollar is the safest investment during the times of crisis, as long as no other currency rises to challenge it, the US dollar will never fall. So the trillion dollar question that the world needs to answer in the 21st century is who will be the next superpower? Which currency will be the next most trusted currency? Because ladies and gentlemen, if the trust in the US dollar fades away, the world needs another currency and another superpower as a backup. Unfortunately, the world right now does not have a backup because the only backup that we can think of is China. And China is not yet the most trusted country in the world. And this brings us to the most important lesson of all. Do you realize in spite of China being the next big superpower just because nobody can trust China, China is losing out on trillions and trillions of value. and the United States. Well, just because the world trusts the dollar, they're able to create trillions of dollars and they're able to get away with $36 trillion in debt. That's all for my side today, guys.
