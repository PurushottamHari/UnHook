2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,080
Ladies and gentlemen, the American

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,480
dollar is a ticking time bomb. You know,

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,480
in 1923, after Germany lost the World

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,320
War I, the German government was forced

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,160
to pay $33 billion in reparations. 1923

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
was disastrous for Germany. In that

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,240
year, French and Belgian troops entered

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,399
the ruer to force the Germans to pay up.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,200
The Allies presented the London schedule

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,440
of payment. The final war reparations

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
bill, which they expected that Germany

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,360
would pay, the total, which the Germans

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,440
had negotiated down from previous

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,520
offers, was 132 billion gold marks. So,

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,840
you know what they did? They started

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,000
printing money. And when they started

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,920
printing money, Germany unlocked an

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
economic horror story that they would

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,160
remember for a century. The German

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,160
currency became so worthless, so

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,600
worthless that in 1921, $1 was equal to

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,479
70 German marks. But by the end of 1924,

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,880
$1 was equal to 4.2 trillion German

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,040
marks. Money was so worthless that

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,119
people literally burned cash for fire

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
because firewood was more valuable than

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,920
the currency they were burning. Because

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
of the enormous reparation cost to be

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,159
paid in gold, there was no longer any

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
backing for the mark. As the mark lost

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,080
value, the government printed more

33
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,880
money. The German middle class was the

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,799
worst hit. People would be paid in the

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
morning and have suitcase fulls of

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,600
banknotes and they would have to then

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,439
run to the shops because the time when

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,079
they bought their goods, their food, the

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,119
prices would have risen.

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,240
A loaf of bread cost 2 billion marks. A

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,479
pound of butter cost 2 trillion marks.

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
Unemployment, hunger, and a hopeless

43
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,640
future distinguished the Wymer Republic

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
to the German people. And the same thing

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
happened in Zimbabwe also when they

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,159
printed money to get out of their

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,680
economic crisis. Zimbabwe's

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,680
hyperinflation hit 89.7%.

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,680
Yes, 89.7%

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,599
as in 89.7 followed by 20 freaking

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
zeros. the announcement by the central

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,120
bank that it has launched three new

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,080
additional nodes, one for 250,000,

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,760
500,000 and 750,000. The country's

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
economy has now become one of the

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,040
world's worst food production and

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,599
agricultural exports dropped

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,000
drastically. Now the economy is blighted

59
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,840
by hyperinflation and joblessness.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Difficult to get basic food commodities

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
and many people are having to go into

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
neighbor country to buy flour, sugar and

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,920
even cooking oil. Life is tough in

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Zimbabwe. bread lines are a common

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,519
sight. Similarly, when Venezuela printed

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,440
money, hyperinflation hit 1 million%.

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,599
So, what does history tell us? History

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,440
tells us that every time a country

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,920
prints a lot of money to get out of

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,720
economic crisis, they face an economic

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,040
horror due to hyperinflation. But here's

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,920
where it gets insane. You know, in April

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,879
2020 alone, the United States of America

74
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,040
created $3 trillion.

75
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,120
And this is where economists believe

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,159
that the dollar could be turning into a

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,200
ticking time bomb. Why? Because the US

78
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,680
debt today is over $36 trillion, which

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,760
is more than the GDP of India, China,

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,920
Russia, UK, and Japan combined.

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,400
36 36 36 trillion. That's the debt. 36

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
trillion. It's a ticking time bomb. And

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
according to the IMF, it is ticking

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
louder than ever. The International

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
Monetary Fund, it has issued a direct

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,560
warning. Without exaggeration, American

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,599
debt is a ticking time clock. $25

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,239
trillion of new debt on top of the $36.2

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,239
trillion we have now, which is already

90
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,280
the most debt of any country in the

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,840
world that will detonate unless we take

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,040
serious responsible action. But somehow,

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
do you realize there is no

94
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,439
hyperinflation in the US? The US economy

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,680
is not collapsing at all. And the United

96
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,000
States seems to be progressing no matter

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,680
what they do. And this is why ladies and

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
gentlemen, the American dollar could be

99
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,239
a ticking time bomb that could one day

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,080
destroy the entire world economy. So the

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
question is, even after creating so much

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,639
money, why is America not experiencing

103
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,720
hyperinflation? Can America simply keep

104
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,199
on creating money without any worry at

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
all? And how on earth is the world still

106
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,600
trusting the US dollar in spite of all

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,600
this madness?

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,880

153
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
episode.

154
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,280
[Music]

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
In the current situation, like we saw,

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,880
the United States has $36 trillion in

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,639
debt with $1 trillion just going into

158
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,400
interest payments. And like we discussed

159
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,479
in our previous case study, they have

160
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,400
crossed their debt ceiling 70 times

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,160
since 1960. In fact, in 2020 2021, the

162
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,759
United States created around $3

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,520
trillion.

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,039
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,080
Thursday the US hit the 31.4 4 trillion

166
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,479
borrowing cap set by Congress. With the

167
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,919
potential for US economic catastrophe,

168
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,680
raising the debt ceiling has

169
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,639
historically been a routine and

170
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,319
bipartisan act. The debt ceiling has

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,400
been revised 78 times since 1960. This

172
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,720
is about economic stability versus

173
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,800
economic chaos. So, how do Americans

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,440
just make $1 trillion out of thin air

175
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,680
using their dollar power? Well, this is

176
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,600
how the money machine of the dollar

177
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,880
works. Step number one, the Federal

178
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,680
Reserve, which is America's central

179
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,080
bank, it creates $500 billion of new

180
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,759
money to buy bonds. Now, mind you, this

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,599
money is not handed over to the

182
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,599
citizens. Neither is it physically

183
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,160
printed. This money is created

184
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,039
digitally. Then comes step number two.

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,800
The Federal Reserve buys $500 billion

186
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,840
worth of 10-year bonds from commercial

187
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,720
banks at, let's say, 1% interest. So,

188
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,440
Bank A sells $150 billion in bonds, bank

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,160
B sells $200 billion in bonds, and bank

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,919
C sells $150 billion in bonds. So, the

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,720
Fed credits these banks with $500

192
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,199
billion in new reserves, all digitally

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,680
created. Then comes step number three.

194
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,840
Now that banks have 500 billion in fresh

195
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
reserves, they start lending more money

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,039
to businesses and consumers. So, bank A

197
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,599
lends $50 billion to businesses and bank

198
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,000
B lends $und00 billion for mortgages and

199
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,160
Carlos. And this sudden flood of money

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,360
allows banks to lower interest rates

201
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,360
from 5% to 3%. Why? Because the supply

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,199
of money is very high. And then comes

203
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
step number four which is where the

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,120
economic cycle starts moving. So what

205
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
happens in this cycle? An example of the

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
same would be the fact that the

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
developers would borrow more money to

208
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
build homes. So while they build homes,

209
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
they would hire workers, plumbers,

210
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,199
electricians and laborers. Similarly, as

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
home buyers keep on getting loans, they

212
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,400
would buy properties, they would buy

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,599
furniture and they would buy several

214
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,919
other things which will keep the

215
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,080
economic cycle moving and eventually

216
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,720
more people will work, more people will

217
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,800
earn and more people will spend. And

218
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,280
when the spending goes up, asset

219
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,520
appreciation happens. And this is where

220
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,280
step number five comes into play. As

221
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,519
demand rises for real estate and

222
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,360
consumer goods, stock prices go up,

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,279
property prices go up, and most

224
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,080
importantly, the government's tax

225
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,399
revenue starts going up. And just like

226
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,800
that, the US government uses digital

227
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,200
money to reduce its burden and keep the

228
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,120
economic flywheel running. But now this

229
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
begs another question. If Zimbabwe,

230
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,880
Germany, Venezuela, Turkey, all of them

231
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,279
faced hyperinflation after printing

232
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,519
money, why hasn't the US faced

233
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
hyperinflation yet? Well, as it turns

234
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,160
out, whenever the US is in trouble, the

235
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,000
global market somehow comes together

236
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,800
just to save the United States of

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,640
America. Sounds shocking, right? Well,

238
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
let's go back to 2021 and you'll

239
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,720
understand the story very well. When the

240
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
pandemic hit in 2020, the American

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,600
economy came to a standstill. So, the US

242
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,680
government injected $3 trillion over 2

243
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
years. And as soon as that happened,

244
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,440
three things followed. Firstly,

245
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,680
Americans had more money. The businesses

246
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
had more money. The consumers spent more

247
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,959
and the company started growing.

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,640
Eventually, the economic cycle started

249
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,320
spinning and the economy started

250
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
growing. Secondly, the US dollar

251
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
depreciated. But the catch over here is

252
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,200
that when the US dollar goes down in

253
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,680
value, US goods and oil becomes cheaper

254
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,240
in the global market. So, the global

255
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
demand for American exports and oil goes

256
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
up. For example, if the dollar weakens,

257
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
avocado becomes cheaper globally. And

258
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,760
what happens when avocado becomes

259
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,920
cheaper? countries start importing more

260
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,080
avocados. And since the US dollar is the

261
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,000
world's reserve currency, central banks

262
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,160
all around the world hold dollars in

263
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,959
their reserves. And most global trade

264
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,600
like oil, gold, wheat is still settled

265
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,760
in dollars. So when the dollar drops,

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,240
everybody still needs the dollar, which

267
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,600
means the demand comes roaring back

268
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
because no matter what happens,

269
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
everybody needs oil because oil

270
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,760
eventually fuels the growth of any

271
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,000
economy. So in 2021 as the dollar

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,240
depreciated the demand for oil shot up

273
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,040
and this rising demand brought back the

274
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,360
value of dollar on track and this

275
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,160
happened very very quickly and then to

276
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,560
make matters better for America in 2022

277
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
the Russia Ukraine war broke out and

278
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
when the war broke out what happened the

279
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,440
world started to panic Ukraine's capital

280
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,360
city of Keev is under attacks

281
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,760
between Russia and the west are growing

282
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,079
rapidly President Biden has ordered

283
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,000
several thousand US troops to take up

284
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,399
new positions in Eastern Europe. The

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,800
attacks on Ukraine has clearly rattled

286
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
global markets as well, sending stocks

287
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,959
tumbling. Big move we've seen is in the

288
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
price of oil. Crude oil prices now close

289
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,839
to $100 a barrel. Energy prices and

290
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
volatility would likely spike even

291
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,680
higher in the European Union, which

292
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
relies, as we know, heavily on Russia.

293
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,839
When the world started to panic, what

294
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,640
happened? investors started selling

295
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,880
assets from all over the globe and ran

296
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,519
back to the United States to park their

297
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,079
money in the US market. Why? Because

298
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,959
even in curios, the US dollar is the

299
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,760
safest asset on the planet. And the same

300
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,760
thing happened in 2008 also after the US

301
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,320
injected billions of dollars, the dollar

302
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,079
dipped in value. But somehow the world

303
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,640
recovered and the demand for dollar

304
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,480
spiked again and eventually Europe got

305
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640
hit with debt crisis because of which

306
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
again investors panicked and they ran

307
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,040
back to the US and parked their money in

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,440
the US dollar. Why? Because whenever

309
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,000
chaos happens the US dollar is the

310
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,839
safest asset to invest in. So after all

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
this chaos when the demand for dollar

312
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,160
rises again the Federal Reserve quietly

313
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,079
steps in and raises the interest rates

314
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,079
and tightens the money supply to cool

315
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,360
the things off. So if you look at the

316
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,760
pattern, what's happening over here

317
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,760
guys? When the US is in an economic

318
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,320
crisis where it has no other option,

319
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,560
they literally create money in order to

320
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,880
save themselves from an economic crisis.

321
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,959
When they create money, the value of the

322
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,680
dollar tips. But when the value of the

323
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,399
dollar dips because the world trades

324
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,480
with the dollar, they need more oil,

325
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,920
they need more avocados, and they need

326
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,160
more gold. So when this trade increases,

327
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,560
the demand for dollar rises. And when

328
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,399
the demand for dollar rises, this dip in

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,480
the dollar value comes back again

330
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,639
because of which the dollar comes back

331
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
to its original value. And somehow every

332
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,920
time the United States deploys

333
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,639
quantitative easing to create billions

334
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,639
and trillions of dollars, although the

335
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
dollar value dips in short term,

336
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,920
somewhere or the other there is an

337
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
economic crisis because of which the

338
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,079
investors flood back to the US and park

339
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,240
their money in dollars. And when the

340
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,800
investors pour in billions and trillions

341
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,040
of capital into the US market and buy

342
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,360
the US dollar, the dollar demand

343
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,680
increases and the dollar comes back to

344
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,800
track. And all of this happens because

345
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,880
the world trade happens with dollars.

346
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,279
Why? Because everybody in the world

347
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,600
trusts the US dollar. So ladies and

348
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,600
gentlemen, do you realize the real power

349
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,760
does not lie with the US army or the

350
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,079
Silicon Valley. It lies with the US

351
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,240
dollar. And more importantly, it lies

352
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,480
with the trust that the world places on

353
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,200
the US dollar. Because if Turkey starts

354
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,760
printing money, nobody wants the LRA.

355
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,560
Why? Because nobody buys oil in Turkish

356
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,399
LRA and nobody trusts the Turkish LRA.

357
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,079
Similarly, if Venezuela starts printing

358
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
money, nobody trusts the Venezuelan

359
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,920
currency because even if you have

360
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,839
billions and trillions of Venezuelan

361
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,320
currency, nobody's going to give you oil

362
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,000
in exchange for Venezuelan currency. So

363
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
it doesn't really matter whether it is

364
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Germany, Turkey or Venezuela. If they

365
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,600
start printing money, even if you have

366
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
billions and trillions of these

367
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,000
countries currency, it will be worthless

368
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,120
because nobody will sell you oil in

369
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,519
exchange for these currencies. So the

370
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,600
dollar and the trust of the dollar is by

371
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,920
far the most powerful asset that the

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,399
United States has. So here's the moral

373
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,959
of the story. As long as the world buys

374
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,880
oil in dollars, as long as dollar is the

375
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,279
safest investment during the times of

376
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,760
crisis, as long as no other currency

377
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,000
rises to challenge it, the US dollar

378
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,199
will never fall. So the trillion dollar

379
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,760
question that the world needs to answer

380
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,560
in the 21st century is who will be the

381
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,199
next superpower? Which currency will be

382
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,720
the next most trusted currency? Because

383
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,720
ladies and gentlemen, if the trust in

384
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,560
the US dollar fades away, the world

385
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,440
needs another currency and another

386
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,440
superpower as a backup. Unfortunately,

387
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,199
the world right now does not have a

388
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
backup because the only backup that we

389
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,600
can think of is China. And China is not

390
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,680
yet the most trusted country in the

391
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,920
world. And this brings us to the most

392
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
important lesson of all. Do you realize

393
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,079
in spite of China being the next big

394
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,040
superpower just because nobody can trust

395
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,199
China, China is losing out on trillions

396
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,880
and trillions of value. and the United

397
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,240
States. Well, just because the world

398
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,079
trusts the dollar, they're able to

399
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,959
create trillions of dollars and they're

400
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,560
able to get away with $36 trillion in

401
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,760
debt. That's all for my side today,

402
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,279
