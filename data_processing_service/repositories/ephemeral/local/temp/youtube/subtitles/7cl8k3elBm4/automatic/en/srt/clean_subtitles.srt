I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, such amazing protests are going on against tourism in Europe that I can't even describe them.  I'm bringing the spray can.   They are throwing it on the tourists.  So this tourism of Spain, tourism of Italy, in fact in the whole of Europe it is not just about Spain.  Main Spain is happening more in Italy. More is happening in Portugal.  But this type of tourist go home CAV India.  I don't know Spanish nor French.  It is happening in France as well.  Such protests are being seen everywhere in the Lovere Museum. So, we will talk about it in detail.  But today is the last day of our amazing YouTube Plus Thumbnail course so make the best out of it.

So on 15th June, that is two days ago, the entire city of Barcelona is in Spain.  You might have heard of Barcelona.  Barcelona is known to many people as a football club but it is very beautiful.  So Barcelona which is in Spain.  Genua which is in Italy.  Lisbon which is the capital of Portugal.  St. Sebastian which is again in Spain.  This island, friends, here 10 lakh people live and 1.5 to 15 lakh people, that is, 10 lakh people live here.  15 lakh tourists came.  This is also within Spain, Balearic Island.  So there have been tremendous protests and a lot of discontent has been seen among the people because due to this local life gets disrupted.  Housing and Public Infrastructure: Friends, I will give you the example of India.  Right now, friends, 3 lakh vehicles have come to Shimla within a week. 3 Lakh I have been to Shimla. I went by toy train. But the traffic in Shimla is becoming unbearable. Now look, brother, there are summer holidays from 15th May to 30th June. People will go to the mountains.  When it is hot we run to the mountains.  After this the crowd reduces. But India also has a huge tourist problem and there is a lack of civic sense in India too.  So we want to make the mountains dirty, throw garbage, all this is our thing, so somewhere in Shimla also these issues have been raised because see, it is being said that the way houses are being built on the mountains because tourism is such a sector which will give a lot of money to everyone.  No one needs to do anything. If people are coming, then even if you set up a small shop, they will give you money and go away.  And, brother, some of the houses are being built on slopes of 70-80 degree slopes.  And we saw this when the flood came and many houses were washed away. So there is already a problem of unregulated structure in Shimla. The way illegal structures have been built.  And the second thing is that the tourists who are coming now, be it in Shimla, you see them in Nainital, Mussoorie during the weekends. Horrible traffic jam is seen in Kedarnath Chardham. Actually very few people are going there to have darshan.  Out of 100, only 10 will be true pilgrims.  The remaining 90 are going to spin or make reels. Right now in Vrindavan, a couple was making a reel in fake.  There was a woman there who scolded me, she was old. Brother, you come and have darshan, are you promoting yourself on social media there? But friends, it is becoming a reality that tourism definitely gives you a very good livelihood.  Now look at Kashmir, tourism in Kashmir has been impacted to a great extent.  Is it okay?  There would have been an impact in Meghalaya as well but you will see that the murder case has been solved.  Isn't it?  Yes I myself Meghalaya is very beautiful.  It is very good. I have gone there myself.  So that is what I am telling you, tourism is very wonderful.  But now if it becomes overcrowded, there is excessive pressure, due to tourism, more tourists come than the number of people staying there, then you can imagine what the condition of the city can be.  The city can be dirty.  This could be a big problem for the locals.  And friends, this is what has been said here that there is discontent.  Why?  Firstly, we are not able to live the local life.  We are just not able to live.  Same thing is happening in Dehradun and Mussoorie also. There too, people are raising their voices that the locals are very troubled. Due to increase in tourism, prices of every house will increase again.  Brother, it is obvious that everyone would want to open a hotel.  In Ayodhya where the price of land was Rs 1500. After the construction of Ram temple, ₹10 has become ₹100 per square feet. Friends, in Banaras, you cannot walk in the heat.  There is so much crowd at Gadolia side.  So much crowd.  Ok?  And there are narrow streets there because we did not plan according to tourism and there should be regulation regarding tourism in India too. is a must.  Then the public infrastructure also gets ruined.  So Europe is protesting against this issue here.  They are telling you in Barcelona that there was a small gun, it was of the water gun type. She became a symbol of dissent.  Although no one was harassed like this here.  But this is what was sprayed on the tourist. But there was nothing in it.  But look, I think this is not right.  That's very bad, some tourist is coming brother, see everyone is going for a trip.  Everyone is now 12%, 12% of the GDP of Spain.  Tourism is the biggest contributor.  Because tourism is soft power.  You also showcase your country. And India is far behind in this.  India should be showcased.  India means the whole world does not need to go anywhere.  You should travel in India itself.  You will get everything here. At Louis Vuitton and many other Shore stores, banners read “Tourists Go Home, Tourism Is Stealing From Us.” All these things, you know, these type of banners can be seen.  Here Yvan Mas, a 31 year old waiter, explains, “The problem is the tourism model.”  You will serve drinks, this is what real estate and hotel industry is all about.  People will drink alcohol here and riots will also occur.   The real estate industry is booming.  Where the power of the earth is touching the sky.  And then the hotel industry is booming.  But what about the rest ?  What about those who are local here?   The protesters are saying that look, there are no individual visitors but we want to reform the system, which is an economic system.  If you are making a system, it should benefit everyone and not just a select few. The policy is ignoring local needs and this is what is happening in many cities of India that you are promoting tourism by ignoring local needs and this is not right.  Now the protesters said that we had planned this long ago that we were going to protest. Friends, this is happening more in Southern Europe.  Is it okay ?  We got to see demonstrations of this type in buildings and many such places last year in July 2004 also. Every year I tell you that many tourists from India go there in May-June. Ok?  And some, like 80-90 out of 100 tourists are very good in India but some people bring disrepute to India and if even one person is doing this then there is something wrong.  Now you saw that an incident happened in Turkey where a man is teasing the girls.   He is behaving rudely.  Similarly, in Japan you saw a girl, she was screaming like an ignorant person.  I saw in China, everyone is silent there.  So, by doing this the name of Indians is being tarnished.  Is it okay?  These type of activities are being done by these ignorant people, the government should not take any action against them, what are you doing by going there, then what happens is that when Indians go there, they are looked at with the same eyes, now like the Donkey Route, for example, the Donkey Route people go there by donkeying, the illegal ones, they go from South America to America. Today the situation is such that if you go to the nations of South America then first of all you will be asked whether you have come to kill a donkey, some countries like Colombia or the others there, so if you say that brother you have come here for a trip, then you have come here for a trip, Oh my God, they cannot believe it, this is the situation, so even though it is 12% of Spain 's GDP but the locals said that brother, forget about the money, living in homes has become expensive and the environment is degrading.  Is it okay?  The biggest problem is that you did not do public planning keeping the tourists in mind. You know, this Barcelona, ​​this Italy, you can take Schengen visa all over Europe and travel all over Europe. So this is in Western West Europe, I would say that you should go to East Europe. You will have a lot of fun in Eastern Europe.  Regarding Georgia, relations with Azar Bhaijaan have become very bad.  But Eastern Europe, Turkmenistan and all that is very beautiful.  Well, it comes in Asia. But here Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Austria and Switzerland are also very beautiful friends. But Bollywood has made him more famous. Most of the tourist destinations have been made famous by Bollywood.  Is it okay? Now after that it became Ibiza, Menorca , Meloca, Palma. All these places are parts of Balearic, Balearic Island is also under Spain.  Is it okay?  So here the double-decker tourist bus was stopped and the banners were put in front of them.  Now think, the poor tourists sitting there must have been in trouble.  The situation might have become so bad that something might happen.  So the group says less tourism more life.  Now space spokespersons say that because of this tourism model, a lot of problems are arising. From health care staff to teachers, there is affordable living cost here. Tourism can increase rates significantly.  And as I said, 10 lakh people live there. 1.5 crore people came here.  Balearic Island is what you see.  Is it okay? This is in Spain.  So that's why and more and then after that you will also find Saint Sebastian in Spain.  And here, the capital of Portugal is in Lisbon and also there.  So the same thing is that all these cities, in a way, are like a tourism bomb and it has exploded.  It has burst. Sustainable tourism was not seen anywhere. So Geneva, Venice, all these are in Italy.  Lisburn is in Portugal.  Here also the same thing happens as I told you in Southern Europe, that there is a lot of noise.  There are narrow streets.  The small streets are beautiful streets.  But brother, I am troubled by the crowd everywhere.  And you will find this type of boat rights in abundance in Italy.  You will find plenty of them in Venice.  Yes, isn't it, that Amitabh Bachchan movie which had released, it was a song, Dil Ki Kahani, in the same manner, earlier it was said that there is no road there, it is empty, when I was little, my mother was telling me that there is no road here, there are only rivers, meaning water is flowing in the streets, I said it is true, later I came to know that it is not like that, so they are telling that the small protesters also denied that this is totally wrong and now what is happening is that some of the houses or residential areas are also being converted into hotels. So stop hotel equals two plus this type of day trippers get entry for 5 to 10 dollars. We can see all these things here.  Now after this Barcelona has said that we will ban & BA NB rentals. When this happens, many houses also go under house stay. Couch surfing is done.  Ok?  And converted the house into a hotel.  So what happened in Kashmir now is that as tourism revived in Kashmir, a lot of people in Kashmir bought vans, took loans of three, four and five lakhs and built hotels by taking loans of 30 lakhs and now the poor people are facing problems because tourism has reduced there and that is why I was saying that brother tourism should not be stopped in Kashmir, but anyway, that is about Kashmir but this is an outside matter, Abiza or the rest, they are saying that so many cruise ships which keep running continuously in Abiza or everywhere else, even in Greece, Santorini Berg, Belgium, all those that you can see, they have imposed new taxes. Belgium and Greece have regulated the entire tourism and imposed taxes on it.  Despite everything, tourism in Europe is growing by 5%. Things have changed after Covid. After Covid, people went online.  The bloggers came.   The shots turned out to be beautiful, look Paris is an overrated city.  Ok?  Overrated city.  There are so many cities that are overrated. But when you see them in videos, oh ho ho ho what a beautiful city.  And you do n't know that like the Northern Lights, okay, when you see the Northern Lights in Alaska, you will think, oh wow, how beautiful, but brother, they put all the filters on the camera and do so many other things to take the photos in the proper setting.  Is n't it?  By lowering the shutter speed and in very slow motion.  Actually, when you see it, you will have a very normal experience.   There is a tree in New Zealand, it is in the middle of the ocean.  And it is in the middle of the lake.  Ok?  So it is shown like this that brother, this is the first tree in the world. And when actually Vogue vloggers covered it they said that this is nothing brother. that's nothing.  When there is a lot of water, it seems as if it has emerged from the middle of the lake. But actually it has grown from the ground itself. So many times things are overrated but because of vlogs, movies, reels, it seems that brother, if I did not go here then what did I do?  So all these things are happening. Ok? So these are the problems in Europe. These problems exist in India too.  There are too many visitors and the rooms are in very bad condition.  The Lore, which is a museum in Paris, said on June 16 that it has been closed. Well, the condition of museums is very bad.  The museums in Europe are great. Paris is awesome.  But you must have often seen that someone throws something in the painting of Monalisa in Paris.  And these foreigners, Americans or Europeans do the same thing. Someone throws something.  Someone protests there.  So now all these misbehavior is visible.  Now the staff here actually told us that this was a wild cat strike. Museum staff said because the working conditions here are very bad.  Ok?  And the condition of the rooms is very bad.   There is under staffing.  Meaning there is less staff and they have to work more.  That is why a strike has been carried out here.  So what do you think?  You tell me in the comment box and also tell me what you think India can do. Macron also said that he had promised that we will do reforms.   The problem with Mona Lisa is that everyone targets Mona Lisa's painting. In 2023, Lore had said that the daily visitors to his museum should be up to 30.  Start distributing tickets. Pre-Covid, it was Rs 35-45,000 and from 17 to 22, meaning the cost was raised a little so that not everyone could come.  But still you will see this kind of crowd in museums.  So this is it.  Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant Agnihotri signing off and as we told you must sign up for our course.  If it is the last date then you will get a lot of benefit. Thank you so much.
