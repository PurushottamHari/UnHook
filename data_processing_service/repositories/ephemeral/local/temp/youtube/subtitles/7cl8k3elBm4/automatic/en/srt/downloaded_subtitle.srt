1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,560
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,559
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
Welcome to Study Gloss.

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,480
Friends, such amazing protests are going on against tourism

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
in Europe that I can't even

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,840
describe them.  I'm bringing the spray can.   They are

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,320
throwing it on the tourists.  So this

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,000
tourism of Spain,

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,800
tourism of Italy, in fact in the whole of Europe it is

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,720
not just about Spain.  Main Spain is

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240
happening more in Italy.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
More is happening in Portugal.  But this type of tourist

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,040
go home CAV India.  I don't know Spanish

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,320
nor French.  It is happening in France

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,840
as well.  Such protests are being seen everywhere in the Lovere Museum.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,520

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
So, we will talk about it in detail.  But

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,079

then SEO Plus Thumbnail course is for you.

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,120
So on 15th June, that is

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,600
two days ago, the entire city of Barcelona

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,439
is in Spain.  You might have heard

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
of Barcelona.  Barcelona is known to many people as a

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,400
football club but it is very

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,880
beautiful.  So Barcelona which

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,880
is in Spain.  Genua which is in Italy.  Lisbon

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,200
which is the capital of Portugal.  St.

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,200
Sebastian which is again in Spain.  This

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,400
island, friends, here

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,799
10 lakh people live and 1.5 to 15 lakh people,

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,119
that is, 10 lakh people live here.  15 lakh

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,400
tourists came.  This is also within Spain,

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,560
Balearic Island.  So there have been tremendous protests

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
and a lot of discontent has been seen among the people

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,640
because due to this

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
local life gets disrupted.  Housing and

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
Public Infrastructure:

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,560
Friends, I will give you the example of India.  Right now,

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,880
friends, 3 lakh vehicles have come to Shimla within a week.

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,119
3 Lakh I have been to Shimla.

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,520
I went by toy train.

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,799
But the traffic in Shimla is becoming unbearable.

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,360
Now look, brother, there are summer holidays from 15th May to 30th June.

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,680
People

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,280
will go to the mountains.  When it is hot we run

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,680
to the mountains.  After this the crowd reduces.

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
But India also has a huge

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
tourist problem and there is a lack of civic sense in India

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,879
too.  So we want to make the mountains dirty,

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,760
throw garbage, all this is

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,160
our thing, so somewhere in Shimla also

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,599
these issues have been raised because see, it is being

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,599
said that the way

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,680
houses are being built on the mountains because tourism is

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,840
such a sector which will give a lot of

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,599
money to everyone.  No one needs to do anything.

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
If people are coming, then

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
even if you set up a small shop, they will

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,560
give you money and go away.  And,

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
brother, some of the houses are being built

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,480
on slopes of 70-80 degree slopes.  And

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
we saw this when the flood came and many houses were washed away.

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
So there is already a problem of unregulated structure in Shimla.

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
The way illegal

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,000
structures have been built.  And the second thing is

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,840
that the tourists who are coming now, be it in

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,480
Shimla, you see them in Nainital, Mussoorie during the weekends.

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,319
Horrible traffic jam is

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,080
seen in Kedarnath Chardham.

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,319
Actually very few people are going there to have darshan.  Out

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,000
of 100, only 10 will be true

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
pilgrims.  The remaining 90 are

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
going to spin or make reels.

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
Right now in Vrindavan, a couple was

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,560
making a reel in fake.  There was a

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
woman there who scolded me, she was old.

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
Brother, you come and have darshan, are

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,239
you promoting yourself on social media there?

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,720
But friends, it is becoming a reality that

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,640
tourism definitely gives you a very

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,560
good livelihood.  Now

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,200
look at Kashmir, tourism in Kashmir has been

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,280
impacted to a great extent.  Is it okay?  There would have been an impact in Meghalaya

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,760
as well but you will see

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,519
that the murder case has been solved.  Isn't it?  Yes I myself

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,360
Meghalaya is very beautiful.  It is very good.

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
I have gone there myself.  So that is what I am telling you,

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,319
tourism is very wonderful.  But

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,239
now if it becomes overcrowded, there is excessive

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,080
pressure, due to tourism,

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
more tourists come than the number of people staying there, then

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
you can imagine what the condition of the city can be.  The

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,680
city can be dirty.  This

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
could be a big problem for the locals.  And

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,720
friends, this is what has been said here

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
that there is discontent.  Why?  Firstly,

102
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
we are not able to live the local life.  We are just not

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
able to live.  Same thing is happening in Dehradun and Mussoorie also.

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,120
There too, people are raising their voices

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
that the locals are very troubled.

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Due to increase in tourism,

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
prices of every house will increase again.  Brother, it is obvious that

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,599
everyone would want to open a hotel.  In Ayodhya

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,840
where the price of land was Rs 1500.

110
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,480
After the construction of Ram temple, ₹10 has become ₹100 per square feet.

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,480
Friends, in Banaras,

112
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 

113
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,800
you cannot walk in the heat.  There is so much crowd at

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,680
Gadolia side.  So much crowd.  Ok?  And there are

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,440
narrow streets there

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,199
because we did

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,720
not plan according to tourism and there should be regulation regarding tourism

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
in India too.

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
is a must.  Then the public infrastructure

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,120
also gets ruined.  So

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,120
Europe is protesting against this issue here.  They are

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
telling you in Barcelona that there was

123
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,759
a small gun, it was of the water gun type.

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,919
She became a symbol of dissent.  Although no one was

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
harassed like this here.  But

126
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,759
this is what was sprayed on the tourist.

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,840
But there was nothing in it.  But look, I

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,520
think this is not right.  That's very bad,

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,479
some tourist is coming brother, see

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,960
everyone is going for a trip.  Everyone is now 12%, 12% of the

131
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,440
GDP of Spain.  Tourism is the biggest

132
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,360
contributor.  Because tourism

133
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,120
is soft power.  You also showcase your country.

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
And India is far behind in this.  India

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
should be showcased.  India means the whole

136
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,160
world does not need to go anywhere.  You should

137
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
travel in India itself.  You will get everything here.

138
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,360
At Louis Vuitton and many other

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,680
Shore stores, banners read “Tourists Go

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,280
Home, Tourism Is Stealing From Us.”

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,440
All these things, you know, these type of

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,680
banners can be seen.  Here

143
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
Yvan Mas, a 31 year old waiter, explains, “The

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,960
problem is the tourism

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,520
model.”  You will serve drinks, this is what real estate

146
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
and hotel industry is all about.  People will

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,080
drink alcohol here and riots will also occur.   The

148
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
real estate industry is booming.  Where the

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,240
power of the earth is touching the sky.  And then the hotel

150
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,560
industry is booming.  But what about the rest

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
?  What about those who are local here?   The

152
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,400
protesters are saying that look, there

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
are no individual visitors but we

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,240
want to reform the system, which is an economic

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,240
system.  If you are making a system,

156
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,800
it should benefit everyone and not just a select few. The

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,120
policy is

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
ignoring local needs and

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,919
this is what is happening in many cities of India that

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,960
you are promoting tourism by ignoring local needs and

161
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,639
this is not right.  Now the

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
protesters said that

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,360
we had planned this long ago that

164
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,039
we were going to protest.

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,280
Friends, this is happening more in Southern Europe.  Is it okay

166
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,360
?  We got to see demonstrations of this type in buildings and many such places

167
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,199
last year in July 2004 also.

168
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,600
Every

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
year I tell you that

170
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
many tourists from India go there in May-June.

171
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,240
Ok?  And some, like 80-90 out of 100

172
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,000
tourists are very good in India

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,440
but some people bring disrepute to India

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
and if even one person is doing this then there is something

175
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
wrong.  Now you saw that an

176
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,160
incident happened in Turkey where a man is

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,800
teasing the girls.   He

178
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
is behaving rudely.  Similarly, in Japan you

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
saw a girl, she was screaming like an ignorant person.  I

180
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,919
saw in China, everyone is

181
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
silent there.  So, by doing this the name of Indians is being

182
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,000
tarnished.  Is it okay?  These type of

183
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,319
activities are being done by these ignorant

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,319
people, the government should not

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,400
take any action against them,

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,160
what are you doing by going there, then

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,479
what happens is that when Indians go there,

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,960
they are looked at with the same eyes, now

189
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,360
like the Donkey Route, for example, the Donkey Route people go there by

190
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,280
donkeying, the illegal ones, they

191
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
go from South America to America.

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,720
Today the situation is such that if you

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,800
go to the nations of South America then first of all you will be

194
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,759
asked whether you have come to kill a donkey, some countries

195
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,160
like Colombia or the others

196
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,919
there, so if you say that brother

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,479
you have come here for a trip, then you have come here for a

198
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,639
trip, Oh my God, they cannot believe it,

199
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,400
this is the situation, so even though it is 12% of Spain

200
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,120
's GDP but the locals said that

201
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,120
brother, forget about the money, living in homes has become

202
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
expensive and the environment is degrading.  Is it

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
okay?  The biggest

204
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
problem is that you did not do public planning keeping the

205
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,400
tourists in mind.

206
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
You know, this Barcelona, ​​this Italy,

207
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,039
you can take Schengen visa all over Europe and travel all over Europe.

208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
So this is in Western West Europe,

209
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,800
I would say that you should go to East Europe.

210
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,639
You will have a lot of fun in Eastern Europe.  Regarding

211
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,240
Georgia, relations with Azar Bhaijaan have become

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,160
very bad.  But

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
Eastern Europe, Turkmenistan and all that is

214
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
very beautiful.  Well, it comes in Asia.

215
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,479
But here Germany, France,

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
Spain, Switzerland, Austria and

217
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,000
Switzerland are also very beautiful friends.

218
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,639
But Bollywood has made him more famous.

219
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,039
Most of the tourist destinations have been made

220
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
famous by Bollywood.  Is it okay?

221
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,919
Now after that it became Ibiza, Menorca

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,240
, Meloca, Palma.

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,560
All these places are parts of Balearic,

224
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Balearic Island is also

225
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,360
under Spain.  Is it okay?  So here the

226
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,360
double-decker tourist bus was stopped and the

227
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,039
banners were put in front of them.  Now

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
think, the poor tourists sitting there must have been in

229
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,200
trouble.  The situation might have become so bad

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,519
that something might happen.  So the group says

231
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,279
less tourism more life.  Now space

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
spokespersons say that

233
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,519
because of this tourism model,

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,680
a lot of problems are arising.

235
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,600
From health care staff to teachers, there is

236
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,680
affordable living cost here.

237
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Tourism can increase rates significantly.  And

238
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
as I said, 10 lakh people live there.

239
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
1.5 crore people came here.  Balearic

240
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,680
Island is what you see.  Is it okay?

241
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,080
This is in Spain.  So that's why and

242
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,480
more and then after that you will also find Saint Sebastian

243
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,200
in Spain.  And here, the

244
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,480
capital of Portugal is in Lisbon and

245
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,760
also there.  So the same thing is that all these cities, in

246
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,920
a way, are like a tourism bomb

247
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,920
and it has exploded.  It has burst.

248
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,000
Sustainable tourism was not seen anywhere.

249
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,000
So Geneva, Venice, all these are

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,480
in Italy.  Lisburn is in Portugal.  Here

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,279
also the same thing happens as I told you

252
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,080
in Southern Europe, that there is a lot of noise.  There

253
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,480
are narrow streets.  The small streets

254
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,959
are beautiful streets.  But

255
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,640
brother, I am troubled by the crowd everywhere.  And

256
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,920
you will find this type of boat rights in abundance in Italy.  You will

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,839

258
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,480
find plenty of them in Venice.  Yes, isn't it, that Amitabh Bachchan

259
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,560
movie which had released, it was a

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,320
song, Dil Ki Kahani, in the same

261
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,959
manner, earlier it was said that there is no

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,279
road there, it is empty, when I was little, my

263
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,880
mother was telling me that there is no road here, there are only rivers,

264
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399

265
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,320
meaning water is flowing in the streets, I

266
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
said it is true, later I came to know that it is not like that, so they are

267
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
telling that the

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
small protesters also denied that

269
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,360
this is totally wrong and now what is

270
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,000
happening is that some of the houses

271
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,920
or residential areas are also being

272
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,640
converted into hotels.

273
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,279
So stop hotel equals two plus this type of

274
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,920
day trippers get entry for 5 to 10 dollars.

275
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,519

276
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,519
We can see all these things here.  Now

277
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,360
after this Barcelona has said that

278
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
we will ban & BA NB rentals.

279
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,920
When this happens,

280
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,279
many houses also go under house stay.

281
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Couch surfing is done.  Ok?  And

282
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,600
converted the house into a hotel.  So

283
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
what happened in Kashmir now is that as tourism revived in Kashmir, a

284
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,200

285
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,920
lot of people in Kashmir bought vans, took loans of three, four and five

286
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
lakhs and built hotels by taking loans of 30 lakhs and

287
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,760
now the poor people are facing problems

288
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,279
because tourism has reduced there and

289
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,600
that is why I was saying that brother tourism should not be

290
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,839
stopped in Kashmir, but anyway, that is

291
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
about Kashmir but this is an outside matter, Abiza

292
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,399
or the rest, they are saying that so many

293
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,480
cruise ships which keep running continuously in Abiza

294
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,519
or everywhere else, even in Greece,

295
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,279
Santorini Berg, Belgium, all those that you can

296
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,920
see, they have imposed new taxes.

297
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,760
Belgium and Greece have

298
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
regulated the entire tourism and imposed

299
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,240
taxes on it.  Despite everything,

300
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,160
tourism in Europe is growing by 5%.

301
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,160
Things have changed after Covid.

302
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,399
After Covid, people went online.  The bloggers came.   The

303
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,839
shots turned out to be beautiful, look Paris is an

304
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,160
overrated city.  Ok?  Overrated city.  There are so

305
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,720
many cities that are overrated.

306
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,600
But when you see them in videos, oh ho ho

307
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,040
ho what a beautiful city.  And you do

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,800
n't know that like the Northern Lights, okay,

309
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,839
when you see the Northern Lights in Alaska,

310
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,560
you will think, oh wow,

311
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,120
how beautiful, but brother, they

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,680
put all the filters on the camera and do so many other things to

313
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,839
take the photos in the proper setting.  Is

314
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,760
n't it?  By lowering the shutter speed and in very slow

315
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
motion.  Actually, when you see it,

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,800
you will have a very normal experience.   There is a

317
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,200
tree in New Zealand, it is in the

318
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,120
middle of the ocean.  And it

319
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
is in the middle of the lake.  Ok?  So it is shown like this that

320
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,399
brother, this is the first tree in the world.

321
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,079
And when actually Vogue vloggers

322
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,120
covered it they said that this is nothing brother.

323
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,000
that's nothing.  When there is a lot of water, it

324
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,920
seems as if it has emerged from the middle of the lake.

325
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
But actually it has grown from the ground itself.

326
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,839
So many times things are overrated

327
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,920
but because of vlogs, movies, reels, it

328
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,040
seems that brother, if I did not go here then

329
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,959
what did I do?  So all these things are happening.

330
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,680
Ok?

331
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,000
So these are the problems in Europe.

332
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,760
These problems exist in India too.  There are too many visitors and the

333
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,399
rooms are in very bad condition.  The

334
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,040
Lore, which is a museum in Paris,

335
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,800
said on June 16 that it has been closed.

336
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,560
Well, the condition of museums is very

337
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,160
bad.  The museums in Europe are great.

338
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Paris is awesome.  But you must have

339
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,320
often seen that

340
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
someone throws something in the painting of Monalisa in Paris.  And these

341
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,920
foreigners, Americans or Europeans do the same thing.

342
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,399
Someone throws something.  Someone

343
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,560
protests there.  So now all these

344
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,880
misbehavior is visible.  Now the

345
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,839
staff here actually told us that

346
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,959
this was a wild cat strike.

347
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,240
Museum staff said because the

348
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,800
working conditions here are very bad.  Ok?  And the

349
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,720
condition of the rooms is very bad.   There

350
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,720
is under staffing.  Meaning there is less staff and

351
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,519
they have to work more.  That is why a

352
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,760
strike has been carried out here.  So what do you

353
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,800
think?  You tell me in the comment box

354
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,040
and also tell me what you think India

355
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,639
can do.

356
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,240
Macron also said that

357
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,760
he had promised that we will do reforms.   The

358
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
problem with Mona Lisa is that everyone

359
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,320
targets Mona Lisa's painting.

360
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,000
In 2023, Lore had said that the

361
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,399
daily visitors to his museum should be up

362
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,680
to 30.  Start distributing tickets.

363
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,320
Pre-Covid, it was Rs 35-45,000 and from 17 to

364
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,560
22, meaning the cost was raised a little so

365
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,480
that not everyone could come.  But still

366
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,639
you will see this kind of crowd

367
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,160
in museums.  So this is it.  Be happy,

368
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,440
keep reading.  This is Siddhant Agnihotri

369
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
signing off and as we told

370
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,399
you must sign up for our course.  If it is the last

371
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,800
date then you will get a lot of benefit.

372
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,800
Thank you so much.
