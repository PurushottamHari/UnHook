1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
Let's say you have a fight with your

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,240
girlfriend. You want to do the right

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,520
thing. So you go to chat GBT and you be

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,279
like, "This is exactly what happened.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,400
Tell me what to do." And you go, "Babe,

6
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,760
I just want you to know I want to take

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
full accountability and I care about

8
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,639
this relationship." And she says, "Did

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,599
you get this answer from chat GBT?" And

10
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,680
you go, "I did." How's that going to go

11
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
now? You did everything right, but what

12
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,119
makes people beautiful is not that we

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
get everything right. It's that we get

14
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,880
many things wrong. And I think in the

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,199
modern world we live in, we forget that.

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,199
Simon Synynic is back. He's the

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
visionary thinker inspiring millions to

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,440
cultivate human connection, find their

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,440
purpose, and overcome any modern-day

20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
challenges. So with AI, do you think it

21
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,960
really is cause for concern and deeper

22
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
thought? So I'm not in the AI business,

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,079
but I am in the humanity business. And

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,760
here's the problem that we never talk

25
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,440
about here. People keep telling us life

26
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,039
is not about the destination. Life is

27
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
about the journey. But when we think

28
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,000
about AI, we only think about the

29
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
destination. And it's remarkable ability

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,280
to write the book, paint the painting,

31
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,039
solve the problem. But we forget the

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
importance of doing the work yourself.

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,640
And I think in our modern day and age,

34
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,719
we have underrepresented the value of

35
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,879
struggle. I am smarter, better at

36
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
problem solving, more resourceful, not

37
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
because a book exists with my ideas in

38
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,720
it, but because I wrote it. That

39
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,400
excruciating journey is what made me

40
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,320
grow. But it's the same for love,

41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,479
friendships, conflict. And I think that

42
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
we forget that we give up certain skills

43
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
or abilities because of technology. But

44
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
it's like saying AI will provide boats

45
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,280
for everyone except for the time there's

46
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,119
a storm and you don't know how to swim.

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
And unless we take personal

48
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
accountability to teach and learn human

49
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
skills, they will disappear. Sure, you

50
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,479
can have an AI friend and trained like

51
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
the best psychologist to affirm you, the

52
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,680
best listening skills that exist, but my

53
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,200
ability to know what to do when my

54
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,479
friend is struggling, my ability to

55
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
function in the world or my ability to

56
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,119
cope with stress. These very very human

57
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,479
skills are suffering. So what are the

58
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
other skills that we need to equip

59
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,320
ourselves with based on the way that the

60
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,759
world is heading? Two things. One

61
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,240
is this has always blown my mind a

62
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
little bit. 53% of you that listen to

63
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
the show regularly haven't yet

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
subscribed to the show. So, could I ask

65
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
you for a favor before we start? If you

66
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,079
like the show and you like what we do

67
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,439
here and you want to support us, the

68
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,280
free simple way that you can do just

69
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,040
that is by hitting the subscribe button.

70
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,479
And my commitment to you is if you do

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,160
that, then I'll do everything in my

72
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
power, me and my team, to make sure that

73
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,920
this show is better for you every single

74
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
week. We'll listen to your feedback.

75
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,959
We'll find the guests that you want me

76
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,160
to speak to and we'll continue to do

77
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,160
what we do. Thank you so much.

78
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,280
Simon,

79
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,040
good to see you again.

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,920
It's just familiar.

81
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Familiar. It's so interesting because

82
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,959
when I sit down to talk to you, you're

83
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
one of the very few people that I don't

84
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
come with a preconception as to what

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,120
we're going to talk about. But but I I

86
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,560
come with a feeling and the feeling that

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,519
I bring forth is the feeling of change

88
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,519
and transition. I have lived for 32

89
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,760
years, but I don't think I can ever

90
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,680
think of a time where the future has

91
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,680
felt unclear, uncertain, scary,

92
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,680
exciting,

93
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,519
and I guess unknown. And I don't just

94
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,280
mean with with technology, but

95
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,959
technology is one protagonist in the

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,519
story, and there's many other social

97
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,360
stories playing out from politics to

98
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,680
relationships to all of these things. So

99
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,760
my first question to you Simon is what

100
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
are those things? What are the biggest

101
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
forces of changes that you see happening

102
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,800
at the moment in all of our lives that

103
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,440
you think we should probably talk about

104
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,640
today? That is a big question and I

105
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,840
think one of the mistakes we make and

106
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,519
this is in general is we like things to

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,599
be very neatly organized. We like them

108
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,200
to be black and white. Yes or no, right

109
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,200
or wrong. And as you know the world is

110
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
messier than that. It is more nuanced

111
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,480
than that. And nothing operates in a

112
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
vacuum. Everything is connected to

113
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,080
everything. Especially in a in a world

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
that's filled with this rising

115
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
technology called the internet and this

116
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
burgeoning technology called the social

117
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
media and desires and feeling like

118
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,360
belonging become more and more

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
important. We're struggling to find

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
them. Loneliness epidemic, stress

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,879
epidemic, suicide epidemics. These are

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,280
all feelings of disconnection, lack of

123
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,560
control, and loneliness. And so that

124
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,319
only exaggerates our feeling of

125
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,360
loneliness and despair. and wanting more

126
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,600
and etc etc etc and then you add in AI

127
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,120
and now those feelings of insecurity are

128
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,479
just exaggerated like crazy right so now

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,199
I find AI there's an irony to AI right

130
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,360
so if you go back to the 70s and 80s

131
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
right you had the rise of robotics and

132
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,880
so robots are now coming into our

133
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:39,199
factories and we're able to cut

134
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,440
employees by dramatic amounts and we put

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,759
people out on the street who They're

136
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,800
they worked in a factory, their their

137
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
father worked in a factory, their

138
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,520
father's father worked in a factory.

139
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,960
Like this is this is what they know. And

140
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,000
they say, "But these robots are

141
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,240
changing. They're taking our jobs." And

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
the ruling classes and the and the Wall

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,280
Street classes and the CEO classes, they

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
go, "Yeah, I know technology. You're

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
going to have to find a new skill.

146
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,680
Reskll. Reskill. That's what you have to

147
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
do to reskill." Okay. Flash forward to

148
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
AI. Here's where the irony comes in

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,440
because the world is always nature pours

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
vacuum and life seeks balance at all

151
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,280
times, right? Not always immediately,

152
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
but it seeks balance at all times. It's

153
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,880
always seeking equilibrium. Okay, so

154
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,039
flash forward to AI. Now you hear the

155
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,720
knowledge workers. It's the knowledge

156
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,400
workers who are going, "My job. It's the

157
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:31,280
coders. It's the finance people. My job,

158
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,000
the plumber is not worried about AI at

159
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,840
all. the baggage handler at the airport.

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,320
Here's zero about AI. And so maybe the

161
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,720
right response is it's the future, man.

162
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,199
It's technology. Reskill, res-kill, you

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,960
know, maybe maybe become a plumber, you

164
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,240
know. By the way, money's really good.

165
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,280
You get to work for yourself if you

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,320
want, you know. Um, so I just find the

167
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,039
pendulum kind of funny. With AI, do you

168
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,600
think it's overblown or do you think it

169
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:03,360
really is cause for concern and deeper

170
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,880
thought? The honest answer is I don't

171
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
know.

172
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,039
Everybody falls on one side of you're

173
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,000
over you're over you're you know the sky

174
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,759
is not falling ch chicken little or the

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,960
sky is falling and we're all going to

176
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,280
die. Right. The truth the truth like

177
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,199
most things is probably somewhere in the

178
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,479
middle. But the the real answer is I

179
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,520
don't know and neither does anybody

180
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,720
else. Yeah. And it seems that we should

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,800
have some sort of controls because we

182
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,600
didn't put any controls on the internet.

183
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,440
They did put controls on the internet in

184
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,400
China. Like children don't have the same

185
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,319
access to uh social media like kids do

186
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,560
here. Europe has controls on the

187
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,720
internet and America doesn't. And we're

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,039
the ones that seem to be suffering more

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,199
because of the lack of controls on the

190
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,240
internet. So I think some some And by

191
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,840
the way, when people, you know, talk

192
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,600
about deregulation and no controls, I

193
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,600
mean, they make us wear seat belts in

194
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,919
our cars. Yeah. you know, there's

195
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,080
nothing that we have speed limits, you

196
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,680
know, and and it's for the greater good.

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,960
And yeah, sure, your seatelt's

198
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,639
uncomfortable, but you'll get used to

199
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,080
it, like, and it's fine, you know. So, I

200
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,639
I think the call for no reform is is

201
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:18,080
wrong. Um, there are correct limits to

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,880
keep things safe. I am fascinated by AI,

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,240
both the benefits and the weaknesses of

204
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,960
it. But it is revealing to me

205
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,199
something more important than what other

206
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,560
people are talking

207
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:38,160
about which is we are uh we're a result

208
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,919
obsessed society right

209
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,759
we care about output we care about

210
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
performance we care about numbers we

211
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,919
care about final product more than

212
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,160
anything right and when people talk

213
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,560
about AI they talk about its remarkable

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,919
ability to write the symphony paint the

215
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,960
painting

216
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,759
write the book, write the article, uh,

217
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,240
solve the problem. Like it it is. And by

218
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,720
the way, the technology is incredible. I

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,639
asked only a few months ago to please

220
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,440
take this and put it in the style of me

221
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,800
and it was it was fine. I did it with a

222
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
friend of mine who's also an author and

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
we both did it for ourselves. We did it

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
on each other. It was really fun and it

225
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,080
was fine. I don't think it was good. It

226
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
was it was it gave me a good start and I

227
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,039
could edit it. I did it recently. We

228
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,080
both did it. It was damn near flawless.

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:28,080
It was It was scary good.

230
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,199
Right now, AI doesn't know the thing I'm

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
thinking about. It doesn't know that the

232
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
next book I'm going to write about is

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
friendship. It doesn't know the point of

234
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,080
view I'm going to have on friendship. If

235
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
you ask it what would Simon Synynic say

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
about friendship, it's going to be why

237
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,719
this and why that, you know? So, it's

238
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,039
derivative, right? We know that. It's

239
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,159
not original. We know that. But at the

240
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,919
end of the day, the work is good. The

241
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,519
symphony is good. The art is good. The

242
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,959
article is good. The book is decent.

243
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,959
Like, it's getting better and better and

244
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,959
better. But here's the problem that we

245
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,200
keep not talking about. People keep

246
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,040
telling us that life is not about the

247
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,640
destination. Life is about the journey.

248
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,080
That's what we keep being told.

249
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,440
Right? But when we think about AI, we

250
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,880
only think about the destination. We

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,200
only think about the output. We never

252
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,680
think about the input. Right? I can tell

253
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,680
you that and you and I can both say the

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,000
same thing which is I am

255
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,080
smarter, better at problem

256
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,480
solving, more resourceful, better at

257
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,200
pattern pattern recognition, not because

258
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,600
an a book exists with my ideas in it,

259
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,760
but because I wrote it. The excruciating

260
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,320
pain of organizing ideas, putting them

261
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,600
in a linear fashion, trying to put them

262
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
in a way that other people can

263
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,920
understand what I'm trying to get out of

264
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,000
my brain. That excruciating journey is

265
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,440
what made me

266
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,440
grow. And sure, you can have an AI

267
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
friend and that AI friend has been

268
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,640
trained like the best best psychologist

269
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,040
to affirm you the best listening skills

270
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,120
that exist. Tell me about your day. That

271
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,880
sounds difficult. Boy, it's hard being

272
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,880
you. Oh my god, it's so great being you.

273
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,760
Have you, you know, like it's it's a

274
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,200
it's an affirmation machine built by a

275
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,880
for-profit company that wants you to

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,399
stay on. Can't neglect that.

277
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,720
but for the fact that nobody's learning

278
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,920
how to be a

279
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,440
friend. It'll feel good. You'll feel

280
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,760
like you have a friend, but you're not

281
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,440
learning to be a friend. Right. And it's

282
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,920
the what made you a great entrepreneur

283
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,600
is not that the company exists. Is that

284
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,079
you built it with your hands and you've

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
got the scars to show for it. Yeah. It

286
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,240
was when things went wrong and you were

287
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,720
forced to fix them. And think that now

288
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,640
when problems show up, you're quick,

289
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,519
you're smarter. You're a much smarter

290
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,240
businessman now than you were five years

291
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,079
ago, six years ago. Yeah. Because you

292
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
did it. And I think what we're

293
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,519
forgetting is that there's something to

294
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,959
be said for, and by the way, I'm a fan

295
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,120
of AI. I want AI to make things, but I

296
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,920
would hate to lose out on becoming a

297
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,800
better version of me. And I think that

298
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,399
um to really learn to grow. And by the

299
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,160
way, I used to have a steel trap for

300
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,360
phone numbers. I knew everybody's phone

301
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,519
number and then all of a sudden my

302
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,800
phone, my

303
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,399
PDA, I don't need to memorize a phone

304
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,920
number anymore. I don't know most of the

305
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,160
people that I love. I don't know their

306
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,600
phone numbers. I type their name in,

307
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,360
right? I just have to know their name.

308
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,720
And so my brain literally went on

309
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,920
strike. It said, "Fine, fine. You no

310
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
longer have the capacity to remember

311
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
phone numbers and I can't remember phone

312
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,680
numbers to save my life." Right? So we

313
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,240
give up certain skills or abilities

314
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,079
because of technology regularly, right?

315
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,600
That's fine. I don't have a problem with

316
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,360
any of those things because whether I

317
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,040
can remember a phone number or not will

318
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
not affect my relationships, my ability

319
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,240
to function in the world, or my ability

320
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,880
to cope with stress. But my ability to

321
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,760
know what to do when my friend is

322
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,040
struggling. My ability to know what to

323
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,000
do when I have a fight with my

324
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,959
spouse, my or my partner. My ability to

325
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,240
know what to do when my boss yells at

326
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,399
me, but I don't want to escalate it

327
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,040
or my employee is acting out and I don't

328
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,920
want to escalate it or fire them. Well,

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,560
how do I resolve this? I've missed out

330
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,000
on those skills. and simply asking AI

331
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,600
how should I resolve this thing it'll

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
give you an answer and it may work and

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,399
you've learned nothing right and so it's

334
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,079
the difference between it's it's it's

335
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,160
like saying AI will provide boats for

336
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,680
everyone except for the time there's a

337
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,120
storm and you don't know how to

338
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,480
swim and I'm okay use the boat also

339
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,920
learn to swim so I think there's

340
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,040
something to be said for writing your

341
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,639
own symphony painting your own painting

342
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,800
building your own business, you know,

343
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,600
writing your own book, not for them, not

344
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,399
for the output, not for the output, for

345
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,440
your personal growth. Before I got here

346
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,839
today, I was writing a post for LinkedIn

347
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,480
and I was trying to make the case that

348
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,959
everybody using Chat GPT to write their

349
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,680
emails, their social media posts, their

350
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,360
investment pitches that I

351
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,320
received is now making the internet feel

352
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,560
really inauthentic because people that I

353
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
want I knew for many many years are now

354
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
sending me these perfect cookie cutter

355
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,399
emails with words that I've never heard

356
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,920
them use before. Yeah, of course. And so

357
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,160
when I read it, my brain mentally

358
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,079
discounts it as not being their opinion,

359
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
not actually being them. Yeah. And and

360
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,240
when you feel like you're speaking to

361
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,760
someone's AI, the meaning is gone. So I

362
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,079
I was writing this post about how

363
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,839
actually now there's this premium on

364
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,480
human written language. Like if you make

365
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,720
a couple of mistakes and you use the old

366
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,120
words, you don't use words like forged

367
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,440
and robust. I'd like to forge a

368
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,360
partnership with you, Stephen.

369
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
Furthermore, can we I'm like you you've

370
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,800
never said that to me, mate.

371
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,360
So, the the end dashes. Oh my gosh. It's

372
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,959
funny, right? It's crazy. Yeah. But you

373
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,399
but you're talking about what you're

374
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,160
talking about. Have you ever heard of

375
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,200
the Japanese concept of um uh uh

376
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,199
wabishabi? No. So, wabishabi is a

377
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,240
Japanese design concept which is beauty

378
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,320
in that which is temporary or imperfect.

379
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,360
Okay. So, have you ever seen Japanese

380
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,920
ceramics? Yeah. They're wonky or the the

381
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,560
the glaze is not even. Yeah. And they're

382
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,560
beautiful. You know why? Because they're

383
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,279
handmade. Tree bark. Trees. You know

384
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,160
when you have a wooden bowl, wood is

385
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,240
beautiful. Why? It's

386
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,959
imperfect, right? Think and unique.

387
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,760
Things made on a machine are the same

388
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,600
and less beautiful. And things made by

389
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,519
hand are beautiful because they're

390
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,000
imperfect. What makes people beautiful

391
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,320
is not that we get everything right.

392
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,199
It's that we get many things wrong. And

393
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,800
what makes us fall in love is not the

394
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,880
person who's perfect. It's the person

395
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,320
who accepts our imperfections. And we

396
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,279
know we're in love when we learn to

397
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,959
accept theirs. Not learn to want to.

398
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,880
Right. And you're 100% right. I now know

399
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,560
in the art world, artists are being

400
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:03,760
asked to sign affidavit that say, "I

401
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:06,000
painted this. I made this." Not AI. Not

402
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,839
because it's better or worse. It's

403
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,240
because I want to know it was touched by

404
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,079
human hands. And so I think you're

405
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,600
right. What will happen is everything

406
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:19,279
will be so perfect that it'll be as if

407
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,320
we're all driving or using things that

408
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,160
everything came off a conveyor belt. And

409
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
what we will start to desire is things

410
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,839
that are made by hand. Because by the

411
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,440
way, we think Rolls-Royce, Ferrari. You

412
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,480
takes 39 months to get a Ferrari. You

413
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,160
know why? It was made by hand. Yeah.

414
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
Right. And one of the things that makes

415
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,440
it expensive is the technology and the

416
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,760
carbon fiber and all that, but the other

417
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,639
thing is it's slow and it was made by

418
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,320
people. Human error. The value of human

419
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,440
error. The value of human error. Scooter

420
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,079
Brawn said to me the other day, he said,

421
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,399
um, we could watch a computer play chess

422
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
with another computer. He goes, but the

423
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,079
the chess games that have the highest

424
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,600
demand are one human versus another.

425
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,040
Because when a computer plays a

426
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,639
computer, the moves are predictable and

427
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,399
they're the same and they're perfect.

428
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
But it's the human error of two human

429
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,920
chess players who are worse, objectively

430
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,240
worse at chess that makes it so

431
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,800
fascinating. It's that's any sporting

432
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,560
event, any sporting event. It's not the

433
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,880
perfection of the game. It's the error

434
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,680
that loses the game that adds the drama.

435
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,360
And and and it's like trying not to make

436
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,800
a mistake is as powerful as trying to

437
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,320
get everything right. And it's the

438
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,240
humanity of the sport, the humanity of

439
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,920
the competition. It is the imperfection.

440
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,680
And I think that we forget as people

441
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,279
what makes us beautiful. Like when you

442
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,720
go on a first date or a first interview,

443
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,839
all you do is present perfection.

444
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,279
Put on my my best clothes, you know,

445
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
dressed up. I I don't dress like this

446
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,079
every day. I dressed up on my date,

447
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,440
right? My interview. I don't wear this.

448
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
This is what I wore for my interview cuz

449
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,000
I want to put out a good impression. And

450
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,000
I practiced I and I and I make myself

451
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,440
confident and I've got a great job and I

452
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,880
got a great personality and I love my

453
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
mother and my goodness, everything's

454
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
great. And then you get in the

455
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,160
relationship, you get the job, and you

456
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,079
become a slob, right? This is what AI

457
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,000
is. It's it's it's to your point, it's

458
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,600
it's it's

459
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,360
fake. On the interview example, the

460
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,720
minute you started describing that, I

461
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,720
immediately flashed back to an interview

462
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I had last week in our company where a

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,360
young kid walks in wearing a suit and I

464
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,360
thought, now I have no idea who you are

465
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,600
because I know that's not you. I know

466
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,079
that you don't wear a suit. You're 22

467
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,880
years old. You do not wear a suit. So I

468
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,720
have no indication. I have no clues as

469
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,320
to who you are and therefore it's harder

470
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
for me to figure out if you fit here.

471
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,039
And I think of because what he tried to

472
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,360
do there was show up perfect how he what

473
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,280
he thought perfect was and in some ways

474
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,280
to hide who he actually was. Whereas

475
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,799
this is why I like now on the internet

476
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,160
sloppy text. I like grammatical

477
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,320
mistakes. But you at the same time you

478
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,679
don't want him to show up and put his

479
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
feet on kick his shoes up and put his

480
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,640
feet on the table either. In the same

481
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,480
way that there's an element of respect

482
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,000
you want and you want somebody in that

483
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,320
first interview to put on some effort.

484
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,240
Too much effort, yeah, is pretty

485
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,640
inauthentic, but too little effort,

486
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,679
what's that? This is my diagram. You've

487
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,039
got perfect Yeah. on one end, which is

488
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,919
low, and then you've got poor, which is

489
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,360
also low. The sweet spot Yeah. is right

490
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,760
here in the middle. Yeah. Well, I think

491
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,280
there's some truth to that. And so

492
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,400
there's a level of, you know, like it's

493
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,840
the same thing as like we all want

494
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,080
vulnerability in our relationships, but

495
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,120
not on the first date. Yeah. like I

496
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,280
don't need to know that quite yet. You

497
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,679
know, what are the other skills that you

498
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
think we need to equipped ourselves with

499
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,440
based on the way that the world is

500
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,960
heading? Because we're, you know, like

501
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,480
the calculator came along and we no

502
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,240
longer needed to be able to do

503
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
complicated maths. Completely forgotten

504
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,760
my time tables. I can't spell anymore.

505
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,760
So, I I said to my friends, the most I

506
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,480
can do is 9* 9. That's like the top end

507
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,240
of my range. But with spelling, it's the

508
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,600
same. I get like half the word correct

509
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,039
now with it. But again, you know, so

510
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,799
what are those skills? I think it's all

511
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,480
human skills. I think there needs So I

512
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,880
think where the world is going to go and

513
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,200
at least this is where I'm taking a bet

514
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,679
is that as the end product becomes

515
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,799
easier to produce, it's the humanity

516
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,640
that's going to suffer. And unless we

517
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,480
take personal accountability both as

518
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
individuals and organizations to teach

519
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
and learn human skills, they will

520
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,600
disappear for all the reasons we're

521
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,000
talking about. So how do I listen? How

522
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,960
do I hold space? How do I resolve

523
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,720
conflict peacefully? How do I give and

524
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,200
how do I receive feedback? Those are all

525
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,720
two different skills. How do I have an

526
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,840
effective confrontation? You pissed me

527
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,480
off. Do I know how to approach you as a

528
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,160
friend, as a colleague without creating

529
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,640
a massive fight or losing a friendship

530
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,039
over it? Um, how to take accountability,

531
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,280
how to express empathy. these skills,

532
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,559
these very very human skills are the

533
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
things that we're already starting to

534
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,760
see just with the internet and social

535
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,919
media um are suffering. And so I think

536
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,760
AI will only exaggerate the loss of

537
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,919
those skills and those skills are more

538
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,679
important than learning how to spell.

539
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,360
One of the concerning things was I heard

540
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,679
Sam Alman who's the founder of OpenAI

541
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,919
and ChatPT launch this thing called

542
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,320
Worldcoin a couple of years ago when

543
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,400
chatt really started taking off and it

544
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,919
has been closely tied to the concept of

545
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,919
universal basic income. Mhm. The idea

546
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,080
the overarching idea is that in a world

547
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,160
where AI and automation eliminate many

548
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,480
jobs UBI may be necessary worldcoin is

549
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,039
one way to help implement it. That was

550
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,960
stated by the founder of chachi Samman.

551
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,440
Yeah, I just again I'll go back to my

552
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,760
ironic statement before. Isn't it ironic

553
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,440
that they want to do a universal income,

554
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,960
standard universal income now that the

555
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
knowledge workers are losing their jobs,

556
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,679
but when the factory workers were losing

557
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,799
their jobs, those same people were

558
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,559
massively against uh uh these kinds of

559
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,559
things. So, I mean, yes, what happens to

560
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,840
purpose? It's ironic. And meaning if

561
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,039
we're being because for anybody that

562
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,960
doesn't know what universal basic income

563
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,640
is, the idea is the government, the

564
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
state, whatever would pay you a certain

565
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
amount of money every single minimum

566
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,840
salary. So $2,000, $3,000, whatever it

567
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,039
might be. Um because they don't think

568
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,480
many of us are going to have there's not

569
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,559
going to be enough jobs to go around.

570
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
And I wonder what happens to purpose and

571
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,000
meaning and pursuit and challenge and

572
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,640
all these things in a world where we're

573
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
just being handed money. So we're not

574
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,679
being given wealth. There's a

575
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,000
difference. we're being given survival

576
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,200
money, right? And so, you know, you

577
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,159
know, we have to be very careful that

578
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
says, you know, everybody who's on

579
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,159
welfare is lazy. You know, that's not

580
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,360
true, you know. So, we have to be very

581
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,679
careful that just because we give

582
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,760
somebody something doesn't mean that

583
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,159
they cease to have ambition or purpose

584
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,320
or drive. It's like somebody who who

585
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,919
makes a a commission salary, commission,

586
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,840
you know, works on commission and they

587
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,400
make just enough to pay their rent and

588
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
buy food and that's it. Like, that's a

589
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,200
loss that's a lack of ambition. you

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,960
know, the cases, at least the people

591
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,960
I've heard talk about it, they make a

592
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,520
compelling case for it, especially in a

593
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,760
world where there is plenty of wealth.

594
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,200
Um, but you know, I don't know enough

595
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,280
about it to make an argument for or

596
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,559
against it, if I'm honest. Um, but I do

597
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,919
find it ironic that the Sam Olman's of

598
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,960
the world are calling for it given the

599
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
fact that there's going to be so many

600
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,200
job losses when it's jobs of their kind.

601
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,480
And like I also think that's funny like

602
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,240
what's going to happen when Sam

603
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,240
Altonman's product gets good enough that

604
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,320
he can lay off most of his

605
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,760
staff. Just

606
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,640
curious what

607
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,919
happens. He has made a point of having I

608
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,039
think it's 100 people or less in his

609
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,400
company. He doesn't have like a big

610
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,679
team. And I think part of that is

611
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,799
because when I heard his TED talk a

612
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
couple of days ago, he's saying, "Yeah,

613
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,240
I think AGI is sooner than we think

614
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,080
actually." And I think we're gonna have

615
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
a fast takeoff, which means it's going

616
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,200
to arrive very quickly and accelerate

617
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,120
very quickly. So I think he's actually

618
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,919
preparing not to. Yeah. But when happen

619
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,360
what happens to the 90 people he lays

620
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,840
off when he doesn't need 100, he only

621
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,360
needs 10. This is the question. I'm just

622
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,640
curious. I don't know. And this is why

623
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,400
anybody who has an opinion about it, the

624
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,240
answer is we don't know. But I think

625
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,880
people react very differently when it's

626
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,640
their job on the line, when it's their

627
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,640
income on the line, when it's their

628
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,799
pride, when it's their ego. You know, I

629
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
keep hearing from companies. I mean, you

630
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,799
we were talking about this before we

631
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,360
turned on the cameras. You know, you

632
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,720
know, you talk to if you want a new

633
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,640
website, I guarantee you I I don't care

634
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,440
which company you talk to, they will all

635
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,960
talk about how they're AI this, AI that.

636
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,799
And you ask the question, are you using

637
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,240
AI? Yes, we're using AI. We're doing it

638
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,840
differently. we're the future, blah blah

639
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,600
blah. And then you ask them for a

640
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,559
proposal. It's going to look like all

641
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,480
the other proposals from

642
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,760
2015, you know, and this is how many

643
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,600
hours it's going to take our people to

644
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
program this and code this. And I was

645
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,480
like, what happened to all the AI? Why

646
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,840
is this slow and expensive when

647
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,760
everything's supposed to be fast and

648
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,280
inexpensive? Because they're taking the

649
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,960
margin. Of course, they're taking the

650
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,400
margin. and and they've got a lot of

651
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,720
people doing things the oldfashioned way

652
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,320
because the business model, you know, pe

653
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,559
people work very hard to predict the

654
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,559
status quo exists because there are

655
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,240
people who benefit from the status quo,

656
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,880
you know, that's why there is a status

657
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,799
quo and it's uh and you know, like I

658
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,280
said, everybody's into change the

659
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,720
future, you know, until it's until it's

660
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,640
them that's threatened or their income.

661
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,919
the the billionaires that I that I know,

662
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,039
the one consistent thing they've

663
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,720
whispered to me about AI is that people

664
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,760
are going to have a lot of free time.

665
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,360
That's one of the things that's been

666
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,960
really consistent. You're so right when

667
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,159
you say that when I asked you about the

668
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,279
future of AI, you said, "I don't know."

669
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,039
The reason why I know that's probably

670
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,720
the correct answer generally is because

671
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,880
when I sat with the most advanced people

672
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,520
in AI, whether it's Mustafa who's head

673
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,159
of Microsoft AI, now CEO of Microsoft AI

674
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,720
or people from Google or the CEO of

675
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,760
Google or Reed Hoffman who's the founder

676
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,120
of LinkedIn, they all had different

677
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,480
opinions, which made me to think

678
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,080
actually the right answer is nobody

679
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,000
knows. The right answer is nobody. That

680
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,760
is correct. And and and you always be be

681
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,279
be aware of the messenger, right? Like

682
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,240
you won't have anybody who owns an AI

683
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,000
company talking doomsday scenarios. it's

684
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,520
not in their economic interest even if

685
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,360
they secretly harbor that. It's like

686
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,880
people who used to run cigarette

687
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
companies didn't smoke and let they

688
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
didn't let their family smoke. It's like

689
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,679
I remember visiting Facebook in the

690
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,679
earlier days and they I went into the

691
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,039
cafeteria and they had like like picnic

692
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,320
benches and I was like and they were

693
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,960
telling me with pride how they have

694
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,760
these communal eatings areas to help

695
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,840
people maintain relationship and I was

696
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,440
like this is hilarious. You literally

697
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,440
have a product that breaks relationships

698
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,840
and yet you understand enough to make

699
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,240
people eat together at lunchtime so that

700
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
they'll maintain relationship. I mean

701
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,120
the point being if your economic

702
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,080
interest, you know, show me how

703
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,919
someone's paid and I'll show you how

704
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,640
they behave. You know, one of the

705
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,159
scarest conversations I was privy to was

706
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,360
one a friend of mine who's a billionaire

707
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,559
in London, he knows the CEO of one of

708
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,400
the biggest air companies in the world

709
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,159
who I can't name. And he said, "By the

710
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,159
way, what he tells me in private is not

711
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,000
what he's saying publicly." Yeah. I he

712
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,960
he said to me that what this particular

713
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,039
CEO thinks is going to happen with AI is

714
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,200
pretty horrific. And the CEO of this big

715
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,720
AI company is totally cool with it. It's

716
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
it's and it's horrific what he thinks is

717
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,320
about to happen. And then when I watched

718
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,120
this guy do his like online talks and

719
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,880
give his opinion. He's so nuanced and

720
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,480
everything will be fine and he's an AI

721
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,159
optimist. Then I heard this scenario at

722
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
this kitchen table in East London from

723
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,720
his friend about what he really thinks

724
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,960
and it was chilling. Yeah. Like actually

725
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,240
the lack of empathy. Yeah, that makes

726
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,080
sense to me. But like the obsession with

727
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,440
power was shocking to me. Yeah. The

728
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,520
obsession with power and money and all

729
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,440
the rest of it. Yeah. But this is

730
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,559
because the internet has done something

731
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,919
really strange and and challenged one of

732
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,480
my theories head on, right? So I talk

733
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,880
about in an infinite game, you know, Jim

734
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,080
Jim Carse his theory, you know, in an

735
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,360
infinite game there's no winners or

736
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,039
losers, right? And so like nobody wins,

737
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,480
you know, fast food, nobody wins cars.

738
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:55,279
Like General Motors, Ford, Vauhall, they

739
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,880
can all exist at the same time, right?

740
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,480
And they'll have degrees of success or

741
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,200
not success, but they can all exist

742
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,880
simultaneously. No, nobody's going to

743
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,320
win. The exception is in the internet,

744
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,720
in in the like like

745
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:12,159
Amazon, it won. Yeah. Like you know,

746
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,159
Google for search. Yep. They won, right?

747
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,039
And if you start going down like the big

748
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,799
big tech companies, there is only one. I

749
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,159
mean, sure, there's competition, but not

750
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,600
really, right? Who, you know, Walmart is

751
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,320
making a run of it to threaten Amazon,

752
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
but Amazon's still so damn big. You

753
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,559
know, all of these companies that

754
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,520
there's only one.

755
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:35,360
And that's not good. That you can't have

756
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,320
winners in a in a category. And so, this

757
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,480
is why I think the the race for AI is so

758
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,240
aggressive, for AI dominance is so

759
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,520
aggressive. And which is why people are

760
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,679
not being careful and which is why

761
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,080
they're not putting controls is because

762
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,159
the way that tech seems to work is there

763
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,640
probably will be one dominant standard

764
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,440
and then that's it. And the question is

765
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,600
which one? Because I don't think it just

766
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,120
seems to be the way it is, which is a

767
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
very scary prospect to me that the the

768
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,279
fact that we can have winners is is a

769
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,200
bad thing. Especially if we if we pride

770
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,039
ourselves on being capitalists, then

771
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,320
there cannot be there cannot be a winner

772
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,799
and there cannot be one that is so

773
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,520
dominant that that nobody else can even

774
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,600
compete except for scraps. What are your

775
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,559
emotions when you think about AI and

776
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,159
what's happening? because I I feel like

777
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,679
the moment we're living in is a profound

778
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,679
one and that we don't actually realize

779
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,640
it because when these tools come out,

780
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,880
OpenAI released yesterday 3.0. It's the

781
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,960
best model ever. The day after my life

782
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,320
was the same. So, we don't really notice

783
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
it cuz we go back to work, our clients

784
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,279
ask for the same thing. We have the same

785
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,039
team members sat around us. The it

786
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,480
almost seems like the sand timer is

787
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:43,279
rotated and we're on a clock and it's a

788
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,200
slow disruption of our everyday lives.

789
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,520
Sam Alman the other day on his TED talk

790
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,120
3 4 days ago said in the short term

791
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,320
everything will appear the same but in

792
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,440
the long term he goes life is going to

793
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,760
be completely different. Yeah, I think

794
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,760
that's right. I mean and look at any any

795
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,600
technology like the like AI it was kind

796
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
of the same until it wasn't and these

797
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,200
are evolutions not revolutions. Like

798
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,640
there's a revolutionary bit. Mhm. You

799
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,880
know, like I remember when when the

800
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,799
internet showed up and like brick and

801
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,000
internet shopping showed up and all the

802
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,039
technologists were like it's the end of

803
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
stores, it's the end of bricks and

804
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,559
mortar. Like they're done. Like we'll

805
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,640
never go to a shop again. Well, that

806
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,080
didn't happen. Now shops struggle to

807
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,760
compete against internet, but that's a

808
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,520
price thing, right? That's that's a

809
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,120
business model thing. But we like going

810
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,399
shopping because again, they've all of

811
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,559
these companies always forget,

812
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,880
especially technologists. They all

813
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,840
forget that the end user is a human

814
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,600
being. And most of us don't fully

815
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,080
understand everything. Even even our

816
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440
iPhones, most people use a a small

817
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,960
percentage of all the capabilities of

818
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,799
our iPhones. Most of us don't even know

819
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,520
how to change the damn settings to make

820
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,120
it do something we want, right? Even and

821
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,960
you neither do your kids. It's not an

822
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,520
adult thing, right? It's not an old

823
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,039
person thing. Like, and there's a few

824
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,440
people who get more out of it and good

825
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,960
for them. Some people use it just as a

826
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,720
phone. Fine. And it's a bell curve. So,

827
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
I think there will be a few people and a

828
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,000
few companies that will get more value

829
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
out of these things than the rest of us.

830
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,039
But I think he's right. I think there'll

831
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,000
be a revolutionary bit and then it'll

832
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,520
settle. I I I'm find this whole thing

833
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,039
fascinating when you ask me how do I

834
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,799
feel, you know, depending on what

835
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,919
subject I'm talking about. Absolute fear

836
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,360
and absolute amazement. I I I have I

837
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,640
have both and everything in between.

838
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,799
When I think about how it affects

839
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,000
democracy and the ability to make deep

840
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,600
fakes and and how it can manipulate

841
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,279
people and their opinions to vote one

842
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,440
way or another, I have real fear. Yeah.

843
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,120
Right. When it comes to like

844
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,720
productivity and the reshaping of

845
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,159
business, you know, technologists and

846
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
people who who were part of the internet

847
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,159
revolution, they love to say, you know,

848
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,640
20 years ago, 80% of the jobs we have

849
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,799
now didn't exist. They love to say that,

850
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,279
right? But when you ask them now they

851
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,880
they like they they they seem to think

852
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,840
that I think it's the same which is all

853
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,200
those people are going to lose those

854
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,159
jobs in white color you know white

855
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,360
collar jobs and knowledge workers I

856
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,840
they're not they're not going to not

857
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,320
work there's going to be new jobs the

858
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,520
IRS digitized a whole bunch of years ago

859
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,640
right they got rid of all the

860
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,039
accountants and they put in all the

861
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,240
computers right do you know how much

862
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,720
money the IRS saved when it when it

863
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,720
completely changed the the way it looked

864
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,679
the answer is zero yes they got rid of

865
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,039
all the accountants and they need to

866
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,679
hire all the IT people. So the the the

867
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,159
the workforce looked different but it

868
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,320
didn't get smaller. And so I think it's

869
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,279
the same thing what it's going we also

870
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,279
we already know the massive incredible

871
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,679
amounts of

872
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:38,159
energy that it takes for AI to work.

873
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,679
Data centers that use up massive amounts

874
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,480
of electricity like we've never seen in

875
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,279
our lives. Like nuclear has to be a

876
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,240
thing. There isn't enough coal or oil or

877
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,880
solar or wind to power these things. It

878
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,279
just doesn't exist. So nuclear has to be

879
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,200
a thing. So go be a nuclear engineer. Go

880
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,880
you want to get an advanced degree. I

881
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,279
don't need you to be a coder. You know,

882
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,399
coding was a thing for a go be a nuke

883
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,480
because by the way, you got to be just

884
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,360
as smart to be a nuke as you have to be

885
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,799
a a a So you're going to start to see

886
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,840
that. You know, you're going to see

887
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,679
energy work. Um I just think the jobs

888
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,919
will change. I don't think they're going

889
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,440
to like I I completely one thing I do

890
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,399
disagree with, you know, it's not like

891
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,720
you're going to be a bunch of people

892
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,720
walking around bored. I just think the

893
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,399
jobs will change. If there was a a

894
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,039
10-year-old kid stood here now and the

895
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,320
10-year-old said to us said, "Guys, what

896
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:33,039
do you think I should focus on?" I would

897
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,799
say two things. Um uh one is going back

898
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,559
to human skills, learn how to be a good

899
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,840
friend to your friends. Okay. How do I

900
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,440
learn that? You're going to really need

901
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,919
that. How does a 10-year-old learn that?

902
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,679
Or how do you and I learn that? Both. A

903
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,880
10-year-old learns it that when they go

904
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,799
and have a play date at a friend's

905
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,080
house, a smart parent takes away all the

906
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,200
phones. I would hate that the

907
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,880
10-year-old has a phone in the first

908
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,320
place, but if they do, take away all the

909
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,640
phones and make the kids go play. That

910
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,360
when they have a fight, the parents make

911
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,039
them say sorry. You know, go over to

912
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,320
your friend's house and knock on the

913
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,880
door and you're going to say sorry for

914
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,240
the thing that you did. Um, we're going

915
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,279
to teach kids how to resolve conflict.

916
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,559
We're going to teach kids how to pay

917
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,720
compliments. We're going to teach kids

918
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,440
how to take accountability and these are

919
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,360
all the skills of you know what did you

920
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,240
do wrong versus what did your what what

921
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,600
you know like it's not like you

922
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,240
know it's not always the school or the

923
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,320
teacher maybe your kid did is disruptive

924
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,320
you know and so accountability is a real

925
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,480
thing and so I think if we teach those

926
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,679
things to 10-year-olds and to adults um

927
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,039
I think it makes for a better society

928
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,440
and the other thing is go learn a real

929
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,440
skill and I don't mean like that you

930
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,120
know prompting isn't a real skill That's

931
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,600
not what I mean. It's what I said

932
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,200
before, which is it's the excruciating

933
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,039
like what makes great relationships

934
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,559
great is not that you get along all the

935
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,760
time. The best marriages, the best

936
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:52,000
relationships, they're not absent of

937
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,159
conflict. It's they know how to resolve

938
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,440
conflict peacefully. By the way, I

939
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,600
believe in world peace. I don't believe

940
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,640
in a world without conflict. I believe a

941
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,080
world in which we can resolve our

942
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,919
conflict peacefully without the need to

943
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,279
go to war to resolve conflict. This is

944
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,679
why I like democracies because

945
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,760
democracies can solve conflict without

946
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,280
bullets. So I the human skills one but I

947
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,399
say a real skill mean like go do

948
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,119
something difficult build something

949
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:18,320
design something imagine something write

950
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,599
something and and and and by the way I'm

951
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,960
totally fine even if you plug it into

952
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,119
chat GBT and say tell me what's wrong

953
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,919
with this your grammar's all screwed up

954
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:32,320
you know and like I said

955
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:35,280
I I am smarter because I did it I'm the

956
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
reason I'm more confident than when I

957
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,679
was younger

958
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,839
And I think that's one of the things you

959
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,839
people talk about you get wise with age,

960
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,919
you know, and like and you know, you

961
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,359
have more confident as you get older and

962
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,359
and yes, that's all true and there's

963
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,960
multiple reasons for it, but I think one

964
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,119
of the reasons is is the things that are

965
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,480
happening to me

966
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,200
now. I've gone through those things

967
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,119
before. They were scary and kept me up

968
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,960
at night the first time and

969
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:03,520
now I know how to do it. I'm not afraid

970
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,920
of it anymore. And so I think what

971
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,480
happens as you gain experience is you

972
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,640
lose

973
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,960
fear. And if chat GBT or whatever AI

974
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,599
product we use does everything for us, I

975
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,920
think you just end up scared. One of the

976
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,520
things that I'm contending with at the

977
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,320
moment with this new technology that's

978
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,000
arrived, being an entrepreneur, seeing

979
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,720
this huge opportunity, thinking about

980
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,839
the dotcom boom and all the great

981
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,040
opportunity that that

982
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,880
created, people talking about the age of

983
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,560
abundance and all these things is I'm

984
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,119
contending with the question on a

985
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,800
personal level, which is when is enough

986
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,560
enough? And maybe this question is more

987
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,880
pertinent now than ever in a world where

988
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,680
creating stuff, building stuff, starting

989
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,040
a company, launching a book, the cost of

990
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,040
creating these things, whether they're

991
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,920
good or not so good, has gone to

992
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,680
basically zero. Yeah. So we can all

993
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,240
theoretically from our computers now

994
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,320
become movie directors and authors and

995
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,320
software developers. And so with this

996
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
possibility,

997
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,960
opportunity and the the thing we need to

998
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,560
deploy is intention like what do I do?

999
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,160
What is the thing that's going to lead

1000
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,440
me to happiness? Do I pursue all of

1001
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,960
these things and start building and

1002
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,520
creating and running off down that path

1003
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,920
to climb some ladder? Or do I take a

1004
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,440
second? When is enough enough? And as an

1005
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,119
entrepreneur who is in this moment, has

1006
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,240
a lot of resources, could roll the dice,

1007
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,480
could start all these new companies,

1008
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,359
could do all of these things. When is

1009
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,359
enough

1010
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,359
enough?

1011
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,200
Now, right?

1012
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,960
like

1013
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,839
we there's something to be said for

1014
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,480
gratitude and if you want to make it

1015
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,920
money we know the data on this right I

1016
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,680
think once you reach I can't remember

1017
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,359
the number it's $70,000 a year of

1018
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,800
income like like when you're talking

1019
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,480
about money you can't buy happiness like

1020
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,000
it absolutely buys happiness up to a

1021
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,480
certain level which is survival and then

1022
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,560
a little bit more you know but once you

1023
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,040
reach a certain level like the there is

1024
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,040
no discernable increase in happiness

1025
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,079
iness that comes with money. Now, what

1026
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,079
money buys is options. You know, what

1027
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,320
money buys is time. You know, um those

1028
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,079
things are true. And you you said it

1029
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,200
like some of the people that you and I

1030
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:20,640
know who have made generational

1031
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,800
wealth. They're not discernably happy.

1032
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,520
The ones that are happier were happy

1033
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
before they made the money. And the ones

1034
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,680
who thought the money would buy them

1035
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,800
happiness or worse, the money took away

1036
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,640
their purpose. Because when they made

1037
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,400
the money, they were driven by something

1038
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,960
that they accidentally made the money.

1039
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,880
They built businesses that were th those

1040
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,480
were their passions and their cause and

1041
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,160
then the money came and they weren't

1042
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,839
building the thing anymore. And you know

1043
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,760
this this is this is the difference is

1044
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,119
like why this this is really

1045
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,800
interesting. It also gets the question

1046
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,480
is why is it that small companies are

1047
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,000
more innovative than big companies,

1048
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,760
right? Like you think about it when you

1049
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,880
say what's the secret for for

1050
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,839
innovation? where you want to have

1051
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,640
resources, you want to have great

1052
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,839
people, and you want to have great

1053
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,599
market opportunities, and then you can

1054
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,280
have great ideas. Okay? So, big

1055
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,480
companies have tons of money. They hire

1056
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
have all the best people. They have

1057
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,800
mature uh marketplaces that people

1058
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,320
generally know who they are, and they're

1059
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,079
the least innovative organizations on

1060
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,160
the planet, right? Then you have little

1061
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,520
companies that have no money. They're

1062
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,640
bootstrapping it. They don't have enough

1063
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,240
people. Nobody knows who they are. And

1064
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,599
there's [ __ ] market conditions. And yet,

1065
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,040
they're more innovative. And then big

1066
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,800
companies innovate by buying the little

1067
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,040
companies. You know, that's basically

1068
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,400
what happens. My exit. Your exit. big

1069
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,560
company can't innovate, they just bought

1070
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,480
you, right? Why is

1071
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,839
that? Why is that the rule? And so it

1072
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,599
goes directly to this. I think I think

1073
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,720
the reason is is because when you're

1074
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,720
small, your ambitions are bigger than

1075
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,359
the resources you have to achieve those

1076
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,800
ambitions. Every small business has

1077
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,440
outsized ambitions, like beyond

1078
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,880
objectively stupid. Like you look at

1079
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,920
what they have and what they've got and

1080
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,800
you they tell you where they're going to

1081
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,280
be and you're just like no. And yet some

1082
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,800
of them do. And I think the problem with

1083
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,200
big companies is their ambitions are

1084
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,880
well within their their capabilities,

1085
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,119
their resources. In other words, their

1086
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,200
vision isn't big enough. And I think

1087
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,320
your vision has to be bigger than the

1088
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
amount of money, resources, and

1089
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,320
intelligence that you have to achieve

1090
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,160
that. And what that produces is

1091
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,160
creativity.

1092
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,680
And so it goes right back to this, which

1093
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:24,240
is if if if we can do so much with

1094
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,280
AI, then we need bigger visions. And so

1095
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,119
when you ask me how do you find

1096
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,800
happiness, I think that we need to set

1097
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,119
our sights on things that are bigger

1098
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,800
than finite

1099
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,800
success. Um, and I think we do need a

1100
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,880
gratitude practice. Regardless of how

1101
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,040
little or how much you have, to be

1102
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,320
grateful for what you do have is a

1103
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,560
profound impact. I went through this

1104
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,320
with the LA fires, right? The I was very

1105
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,520
lucky that my house survived and I

1106
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,480
didn't have to get evacuated, but the

1107
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,960
evacuation zones were getting closer and

1108
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,040
closer. And two things happened that

1109
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,720
were profound that live that I will that

1110
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,680
live with me now. One which is

1111
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,680
resolvable and one which is

1112
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,760
unresolvable. We were all obsessed with

1113
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,440
this app called Watch Duty, which is how

1114
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,800
we track the fires. It basically took

1115
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,160
all the publicly available information

1116
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
and put it in one place in a really

1117
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,359
amazing way, right? started by this

1118
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,079
amazing amazing amazing entrepreneur

1119
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,520
named John Mills. And we were all

1120
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,119
obsessed with Watchd Duty. We all were

1121
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,480
watch on this app the whole time. And

1122
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,599
one of the things we were watching was

1123
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,320
the wind cuz if the wind shifted, it

1124
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,760
could profoundly impact your life. And I

1125
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,560
remember having this experience like we

1126
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,839
were all watching the wind and the wind

1127
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,720
went away from me and I thought, "Oh,

1128
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,000
thank God." And in that moment, I knew

1129
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,320
that somebody was looking at the app

1130
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,240
going, "Oh god, no."

1131
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,520
And it's not like service where I'll eat

1132
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,960
a little less so that somebody can eat

1133
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,079
more. I'll give up some of my income so

1134
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,280
that somebody has it's not one of those

1135
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,880
I don't want my house to burn down so

1136
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,320
somebody else's house doesn't burn down.

1137
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,320
And I has I had to live with this

1138
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,680
paradox of how unfair the world is that

1139
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,119
simultaneously my relief and good news

1140
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,560
was somebody was somebody else's stress

1141
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,880
and bad news and there was nothing I

1142
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,960
could do to change that. So that paradox

1143
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,240
I is horrible and I it was it was right

1144
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,359
in front of me. So that's one, but it's

1145
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,599
the second part, which is the evacuation

1146
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,440
zones were coming a little closer, and

1147
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,200
they were one zone away from where where

1148
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,880
I

1149
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,480
live, and we didn't know if we were

1150
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,960
going to be woken in the middle of the

1151
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,880
night with a with an alarm to evacuate.

1152
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,520
We didn't know. And so we had I had to

1153
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,240
go through the process of packing up my

1154
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,599
car and making my go bag. And I put as

1155
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,720
much stuff in my car as I could. And I

1156
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,920
had to, you know, we all play that game

1157
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,280
like if there's a fire and you have to

1158
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,599
run out and grab two things, what would

1159
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,520
you grab? I had to do that. Right? A lot

1160
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,200
of people in LA had to do that. Right?

1161
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,319
You actually had to make the decisions,

1162
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,680
what am I going to take and what I'm

1163
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,520
going to leave behind. And I found

1164
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,280
myself bringing things that I never

1165
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,560
thought were important to me. And I

1166
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,960
found myself leaving things behind that

1167
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,960
I thought I would

1168
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,200
take. But the one thing that was amazing

1169
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,640
was stuff that I couldn't fit, but I

1170
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,400
still had love for. Like my favorite

1171
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,960
painting in the world. It's just I

1172
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,440
couldn't fit it in my car. I stood there

1173
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,520
in front of it and I said thank you and

1174
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,560
I said

1175
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,599
goodbye and it was like saying goodbye

1176
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,880
to a loved one. You know, I hear this,

1177
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,480
you know, somebody loses a parent, they

1178
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,880
go, "Look, it was awful. And, you know,

1179
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,520
he suffered as on his deathbed, but I'm

1180
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,599
glad I was with him to say

1181
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,280
goodbye." And it was the most amazing

1182
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,359
thing to have gratitude for something

1183
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,520
that I don't want to lose, but accepted

1184
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,720
that

1185
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:27,440
I I might.

1186
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:30,560
And it's made me a lot more disconnected

1187
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,839
from my material things, especially the

1188
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,520
things I said goodbye to because I've

1189
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,240
already said goodbye to them. I had I I

1190
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,839
just sold some of my art for for charity

1191
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,440
and people said, "How did you love your

1192
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,200
art?" I'm like, "I know. Like my art's

1193
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,800
like my babies." Like, "How did you

1194
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,079
choose?" And I said, "I've already said

1195
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,960
goodbye to everything here. I did it

1196
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,400
months ago." You know, and I think this

1197
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,560
idea of gratitude, gratitude for what we

1198
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,160
have, but also

1199
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,319
um like you're going to lose your

1200
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,000
parents. All of us will lose our

1201
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,160
parents. Hopefully. Hopefully.

1202
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,160
Hopefully, uh they don't never have to

1203
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,599
say goodbye to us. But we if things go

1204
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,400
well, we're going to have to say goodbye

1205
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,400
to our parents.

1206
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,520
And we can't be angry about it. We want

1207
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,000
to say thank you for the times we had.

1208
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,599
And I think to have that level of

1209
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,800
appreciation for everything in our

1210
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,480
lives, how temporary all of this is, I

1211
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,800
think that's it makes you happier. I

1212
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,240
know it sounds I don't it's it makes you

1213
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,440
happier to just look at someone and be

1214
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,560
grateful. You know, failed

1215
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,400
relationships. You could be angry at the

1216
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,160
other person or you can be grateful for

1217
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,720
the lessons they taught you and or for

1218
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,599
the good times you had. And I think to

1219
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,520
change our minds to gratitude and you

1220
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,800
can, you know, it sounds it's a little

1221
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,280
bit, you know, hippie dippy to have a

1222
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,800
gratitude practice and that's fine. You

1223
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,000
know, if that's your thing, lie in bed

1224
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,319
every night or keep a journal and just

1225
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,240
say the things you're grateful for.

1226
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:56,040
But I don't know if it works without an

1227
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,160
evacuation zone

1228
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,800
approaching. I don't know. But to go

1229
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,839
around your home and just say thank you

1230
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,160
to the things that you like is a weird

1231
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,520
thing. How many of us How many of us

1232
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,319
when was the last time you called a

1233
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,000
friend out of the blue and just said

1234
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,000
thanks for being my friend? Like hey

1235
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,880
just wanted to call and just tell you I

1236
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,480
love you. Just tell you thank you and

1237
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,839
you know that's all. No just a quick

1238
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,280
just two minutes. Just just want to say

1239
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,960
thank you for being my friend. I think

1240
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,319
if I said that to one of my best friends

1241
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,359
that think I was losing my mind or

1242
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,880
something or that something was wrong,

1243
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,640
they'd be so concerned because it's such

1244
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,880
an unusual thing for me to have. Okay,

1245
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,720
so you can do it this way. So, I had a

1246
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,480
guest on the podcast and he came up with

1247
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,960
this thing that is so outside of my

1248
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,319
personality, but I'm going to try it.

1249
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,520
Yeah, that would make sense. Then you

1250
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,599
can do that. You know, I'm I'm new to

1251
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,480
this. You know, I I know for years

1252
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,839
people have been like, you should have a

1253
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,720
gratitude practice and keep a gratitude

1254
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,280
journal. And I tried it. I was like,

1255
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,599
"Okay." Uh, I'm grateful for my sister,

1256
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,280
grateful for what I've um for my family,

1257
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,240
grateful for my friends, grateful for

1258
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,560
the life that I live, right? Good night.

1259
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,800
All right, next day. I'm grateful for my

1260
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,880
sister, grateful for my family, grateful

1261
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,280
for my friends, you know, and I found it

1262
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,400
so repetitive that I was like, is this

1263
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,839
worth it? Like, sure, like every now and

1264
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,599
then something was different and new.

1265
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,400
And I've come to come to the conclusion

1266
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,240
like if it's the same three things every

1267
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,079
single

1268
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,520
day, it's good. I was thinking about

1269
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,319
this a lot the other day when someone

1270
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,680
asked

1271
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:31,359
me, "Think about all the people in your

1272
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,640
life and imagine if they were sick and

1273
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,880
imagine if you had a billion dollars in

1274
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,440
your bank and a billion dollars could

1275
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,480
cure their

1276
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,960
sickness." Like, who would you cure it

1277
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,480
for? four, would you would you spend a

1278
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,839
billion dollars to cure your your

1279
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,960
girlfriend's sickness, your your

1280
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,359
mother's sickness, your father's

1281
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,520
sickness, your whatever, even if it was

1282
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,359
the the the risk to them was was low?

1283
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,119
And you would. I'd give every p penny I

1284
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,400
had to cure an illness that my

1285
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,319
girlfriend had, even if the risk was

1286
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,599
low. And as I was thinking through that,

1287
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,760
I was like, but then if you look at my

1288
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,599
calendar and how I'm allocating my time

1289
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,440
against these individuals and against my

1290
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,800
priorities, there's a real imbalance

1291
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,920
here. And over the last couple of weeks

1292
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,720
in particular, I've been on a bit of a

1293
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,000
journey of realizing just how

1294
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,640
important four or five people in my life

1295
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
are. I I uh how much I neglect them.

1296
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,079
Yeah. I mean like of course I mean we

1297
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,760
only when it's and it's you're right

1298
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,200
like which is if you say give a billion

1299
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,720
dollars and you can cure this disease

1300
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,760
that affects you know two million

1301
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,400
people, 10 million people, you'd be like

1302
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,160
I'll give some money, right? But if it

1303
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,240
was one family member, you would exhaust

1304
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,240
every resource. You would quit your job.

1305
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,119
you would do everything you can to for a

1306
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,359
1% chance for for a 1% chance you know

1307
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,440
and people do they quit their jobs when

1308
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,599
and and be and like so many charities

1309
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,200
have been started because my father died

1310
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,200
my mother died my sister died my brother

1311
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,200
died and now I've devoted my life to duh

1312
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,760
right like like literally that's the

1313
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,680
reason and it's because it's personal of

1314
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,800
course that makes sense it's why why are

1315
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,960
some entrepreneurs good and some

1316
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,560
entrepreneurs bad well how personal is

1317
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,720
the thing that you're working on to you

1318
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,319
because then I only like to like the

1319
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,079
entrepreneurs that I

1320
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,160
I want to know that they are solving a

1321
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,839
problem that they struggled with or that

1322
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,359
somebody they love struggled with or

1323
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,640
something if they they read an article

1324
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,079
in a magazine they thought this is a

1325
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,720
great market opportunity. There is no

1326
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,880
passion there that is driven by money

1327
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,880
and power only. I want to know somebody

1328
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,359
that is it's so deeply personal to them

1329
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,880
that they will stop at nothing. They

1330
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,960
will run through a brick wall and find

1331
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,119
every creative solution. And it goes

1332
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,680
right back to the small company versus

1333
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,520
big company. It's it's passion and a

1334
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,400
vision that is bigger than the resources

1335
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,520
that I have which you know I had a

1336
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,240
conversation with somebody recently

1337
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,760
actually

1338
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:44,160
where they wanted to uh we we uh it was

1339
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,800
a business problem and they wanted to

1340
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,359
change the goals and I said we can't

1341
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,119
just change the goals because they're

1342
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:52,560
difficult you know so we might miss the

1343
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,560
goal it's true yes we have a very

1344
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,280
aggressive goal and the likelihood of us

1345
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,960
hitting it is incredibly low but why

1346
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,079
would we lower it? And they said to me,

1347
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,520
you know, I don't like to fail. They

1348
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,599
said, I don't like to fail and I know

1349
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,440
you don't either. And I said, ah, that's

1350
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
where you're wrong. That's where you're

1351
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,760
wrong. I have spent most of my life a

1352
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,000
failure. And I'm very comfortable being

1353
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,560
a failure. And I think of myself not as

1354
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,800
a success. I think of myself as a

1355
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,720
failure. And that's because my ambitions

1356
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,480
are bigger than my skills or my ability

1357
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,680
to achieve those ambitions. And so

1358
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,359
almost everything I've done, with a

1359
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,359
couple of exceptions, have fallen short

1360
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,760
of what I had hoped for. I'm very

1361
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,920
comfortable with that because failing at

1362
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,160
80% is really much better than

1363
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,559
succeeding at

1364
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,480
30%. And I think this idea of fear of

1365
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:43,520
failure and embracing failure, I don't

1366
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,599
want to fail, but I just I I have I

1367
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,720
think it's important to have dreams that

1368
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,359
are beyond your skills or your resources

1369
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,119
because that's where creativity comes

1370
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:56,720
from. That's where resourcefulness comes

1371
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,160
from. You know, would you go How am I

1372
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,400
gonna figure this one out? And you told

1373
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,119
me the stories of your own team, you

1374
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,920
know, it's the resourceful ones. And now

1375
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,800
we go back to AI. AI is not going to

1376
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,240
figure that out, right? There's there's

1377
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,760
data on this. I I've actually never

1378
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,839
thought about this. This is good. There

1379
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,160
was a book called Oh, it was the wisdom

1380
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,280
of crowds. I think it was that one. I

1381
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,319
think it was the wisdom of crowds by

1382
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,400
James Herki where people with experience

1383
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,520
knew what to do versus people who were

1384
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,520
just trained. So I'll give you the

1385
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,720
example. This is I and again I might

1386
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,559
have the book wrong but this was I

1387
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,520
remember the case. So there was a a

1388
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,319
bunch of firemen fighting a fire in like

1389
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,640
the in wildfires, right? And the wind

1390
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:39,359
picked up and the fire was coming really

1391
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,280
fast towards these firemen. True story.

1392
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,880
And they all started running for their

1393
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,559
lives as this fire was approaching them

1394
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,200
unbelievably quickly. But the problem

1395
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,440
was if they looked

1396
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,800
ahead there was a small hill which means

1397
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,640
you're going to slow down because you

1398
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,079
can't run fast up a hill and this fire

1399
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,760
is coming fast, right? The senior guy on

1400
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,599
the on the team started screaming, "Get

1401
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,720
down. Get down. Get down." And they all

1402
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,800
ignored him. They were all running for

1403
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,200
their lives. And he just stopped running

1404
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,280
and got down and put his hands over his

1405
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,440
head and just lay in a ball. And the

1406
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,240
fire was going so fast that it blew

1407
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,280
right over him. and it caught up with

1408
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,400
the other guys and burned them all to

1409
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,839
death. Now, they didn't teach them that

1410
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,680
in fire school. It it was accumulated

1411
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,280
knowledge of wisdom of that came from

1412
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,520
experience that he knew the right thing

1413
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,440
to do in the moment. He was able to read

1414
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,680
the tea leaves in a way and his his gut,

1415
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,599
whatever that means, his gut said the

1416
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,240
right thing to do is to drop down.

1417
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,800
You'll be okay. And this is why I'm

1418
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,440
going to sound like a a broken record.

1419
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,640
the importance of doing the work

1420
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,640
yourself, of writing the book, painting

1421
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,720
the painting, choreographing the dance,

1422
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,160
you know, composing the symphony,

1423
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,200
building the business, having the

1424
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,040
difficult conversation, stumbling and

1425
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,079
bumbling, right? The reason for it, like

1426
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,400
let's say you have a fight with your

1427
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,240
your your girlfriend. You don't want to

1428
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,599
be in a fight. You don't like being in a

1429
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,359
fight. You want to do the right thing.

1430
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,800
So, you go to chat GBT and you be like,

1431
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,280
"My girlfriend and I had a fight. This

1432
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,640
is what the fight was about. Okay, I

1433
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,160
think I did some stuff wrong. I think

1434
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,599
she's did some stuff wrong. this is

1435
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,880
exactly what happened. Tell me what to

1436
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,680
do." And you go, "Babe, I just want you

1437
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,680
to know I want to take full

1438
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,599
accountability. I'm really I'm really

1439
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,559
sad that this happened and I want you to

1440
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,040
know that I care about this

1441
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,119
relationship." And she says to you, "Did

1442
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:29,040
you get this answer from Chad GBT?" And

1443
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:31,520
you go, "I did." How's that going to go

1444
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,079
right now? You did everything right. You

1445
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,640
did everything

1446
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:38,480
right. You did everything right. but for

1447
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,559
the fact and it goes right back to what

1448
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,160
you said which is it removed the

1449
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,839
humanity. It removed the personality.

1450
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,880
It's artificial. It's fake. It's

1451
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,079
everything you said about the job

1452
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,520
interview. It's everything you said

1453
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,640
about all those other things about all

1454
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,160
the resumes, all of the pitch

1455
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:54,079
decks. It's not you telling me sorry,

1456
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,359
it's Chat GBT telling me sorry. And even

1457
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,359
though you went with good intention to

1458
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,520
get it right, I would rather you get it

1459
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,800
wrong and bumble and fumble it with me

1460
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,280
and be like, "Babe, I don't know how to

1461
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,640
do this. I'm an asshole." You know, and

1462
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,319
then she fights with you because you get

1463
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,200
it wrong and you rumble through it

1464
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:10,960
together. And what happens when you

1465
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,720
come, you've had this happen. I know

1466
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,720
because I have, and I know anybody,

1467
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,359
everybody has. When you come out of the

1468
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,280
fight, you're closer. Mhm. Not cuz you

1469
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,319
got it right because you got it wrong.

1470
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,599
And if you learn the

1471
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:24,880
skill and you get better and better and

1472
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,319
better and better and you do learn the

1473
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,920
skill of saying the right thing and you

1474
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,280
do learn the skill, she knew it wasn't

1475
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,960
because you asked AI in the moment

1476
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,960
because you just wanted to resolve the

1477
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,880
problem and remove the tension. It's

1478
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,400
because you learn the skill for the time

1479
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,920
that you don't know when it's going to

1480
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,319
happen because you're equipped for this

1481
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,599
relationship. Mhm. And it's that

1482
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,119
investment in the relationship rather

1483
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,800
than trying to transactionally solve the

1484
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,880
problem before me. And that's the

1485
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,119
difference. It's infinite versus finite.

1486
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,200
transaction versus it's destination

1487
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,720
versus journey. I'm in the journey of

1488
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,480
this relationship versus I have a

1489
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,000
destination. I got to solve this problem

1490
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,319
now. Otherwise, this is going to destroy

1491
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,400
my relationship. And all of this is

1492
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,079
coming full circle. And it comes right

1493
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,599
back to everything we started. this. I

1494
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,640
think it's hilarious that you and that

1495
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,400
you're having a conversation with me

1496
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,359
about AI because I'm not an AI expert

1497
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,200
and I'm not an AI

1498
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:13,520
business, but I I am in the humanity

1499
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,119
business. And I think everything we're

1500
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,040
talking about from every angle, we're

1501
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,839
battle testing this idea. And what we

1502
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,040
can't get away from is human beings

1503
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:26,000
really want human

1504
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:28,559
beings and human beings really want

1505
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,720
human experiences and human beings

1506
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,280
really want things made by human beings.

1507
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,280
And we are not only okay with we want

1508
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:40,920
imperfection because imperfection is the

1509
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:44,160
sign of human. I was just thinking about

1510
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:47,280
how how when I'm in an argument with my

1511
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,280
partner, if she was perfect, if she was

1512
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,240
completely composed, if she was looking

1513
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:55,040
at me without emotion, without

1514
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:58,319
expression, and if she was spewing chat

1515
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,359
GPT like responses back at me,

1516
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,079
it would it would be a little bit

1517
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,079
infuriating, but also it would be

1518
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,520
completely dehumanizing as you say. And

1519
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,520
it's funny how actually even in

1520
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,599
conflict, I want emotion. I want

1521
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,680
imperfection. Yeah, I want res human

1522
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,040
resonance. So, it's interesting because

1523
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,880
I've been like thinking about what my

1524
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,559
struggle is a good thing. Yeah. And I

1525
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,640
think in our modern day and age, we have

1526
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:23,200
under appreciated and underrepresented

1527
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,000
the value of struggle. And if you ask

1528
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,800
anybody in their life, you know, tell me

1529
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,319
about a time in your

1530
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,400
career

1531
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:33,520
where like you felt like, boy, this is

1532
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,359
the most amazing thing I've ever done.

1533
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,200
I'm so glad I'm a part of this. It's not

1534
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,640
the big win. It's not the big success.

1535
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,280
It's not we finished everything on time

1536
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,280
and under budget. It's oh my god, this

1537
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,480
one thing went horribly wrong. Oh my

1538
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,720
god, it went so badly and yet the way we

1539
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,640
came together like the most important

1540
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,000
thing in my career was when I lost my

1541
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,359
passion and went into deep depression.

1542
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,839
Never want to go through that again.

1543
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,680
Really glad it happened. And all of our

1544
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,599
relationships, professional, personal,

1545
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,240
romantic, whatever they are, right? All

1546
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,240
of our relationships get better when we

1547
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,680
go through struggle together. And we

1548
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,280
know we know the way the human animal

1549
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,800
works. We know that oxytocin is released

1550
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,640
when you have shared struggle. That's

1551
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,160
why when you put people in boot camp and

1552
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,280
they go through [ __ ] together or there's

1553
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,119
a a natural a n a natural disaster. Like

1554
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,599
all all of a sudden I don't care who you

1555
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,800
voted for. I saw your house blow down in

1556
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,880
the tornado. I got you. Don't worry,

1557
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,240
we're neighbors, right? Like we can put

1558
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,920
aside all the rational

1559
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:30,559
nonsense, the the intellectual nonsense.

1560
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,640
And at the end of the day, human beings

1561
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,920
are are are good at helping human

1562
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,760
beings. struggle also in many contexts

1563
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,559
is the value. So when I think about a

1564
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,559
Simon Synynic book, the reason why I

1565
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,240
value it is because I know that Simon

1566
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,480
Synynic spent years writing that thing

1567
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,920
and pulling it together. The reason why

1568
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,520
certain handmade things that we talked

1569
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,880
about earlier are valuable is because of

1570
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,000
the pain and the toil that went into

1571
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,359
them. And when you think about the art

1572
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,440
world and other creations through

1573
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,200
history, the value comes from the fact

1574
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,359
that human beings came together for a

1575
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,280
prolonged period of time and did

1576
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,280
something. And actually the investment

1577
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,760
is the value. Like the the amount that

1578
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,520
went in the top creates we're not buying

1579
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,520
the product. We're buying the story.

1580
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,119
Yeah. Like the Mona Lisa is You're not

1581
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,400
buying the Mona Lisa. You're not buying

1582
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,079
a piece of art. You're buying the story

1583
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,000
that goes with the art. The story that

1584
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,359
it took to create the art, what the

1585
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,440
artist was going through, what they were

1586
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,960
thinking. You're not buying my book.

1587
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,640
You're buying the story of the making of

1588
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,240
my book. And the Mona Laisa was stolen

1589
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,079
from what I understand. I mean, we don't

1590
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,599
even know if the the one in the Lou is

1591
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,119
the real one. Because I heard much of

1592
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,480
the the reason why the Mona Lisa is so

1593
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,240
valuable is because at one point it was

1594
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,160
stolen and then they like managed to rec

1595
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,520
find it again and actually it's just a

1596
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,119
painting but the story of the is worth

1597
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,040
100 million 200 million whatever

1598
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,119
whatever I mean and so this is what we

1599
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,880
the reason artists are famous is because

1600
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,520
you buy the story of that artist not not

1601
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,480
their talent there's a lot of famous

1602
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,720
singers and actors and painters dancers

1603
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,079
who are a lot less talented than the

1604
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,559
unknown ones but you buy into the story

1605
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,440
And this is why some

1606
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:03,760
celebrities, as much as they talk about

1607
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,680
the paparazzi and the tabloids, they

1608
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,119
want to be in the paparazzo. They want

1609
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,480
the paparazzi to follow them because it

1610
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,400
keeps their story relevant. It keeps

1611
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,319
them, you know, they're worth more

1612
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,160
because they're in the zeitgeist. Apple

1613
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,319
know this better than anybody cuz you go

1614
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,119
to an Apple store and they've laid out

1615
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:23,200
their products as if it was an art

1616
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:25,359
gallery. The three feet either side of

1617
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,280
the iPhone create the impression in my

1618
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,480
mind that that this is a piece of art

1619
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,799
and there's only one of them. And the

1620
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,400
fact that they've wasted all this space,

1621
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,400
which I know real estate costs money and

1622
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,400
that must have been expensive, pours

1623
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,000
into the device itself. If I gone into

1624
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,520
an Apple store and there was a thousand

1625
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,200
iPhones, like the old electronic stops,

1626
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,720
all stacked on top of each other, I

1627
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,240
would assume the iPhone was worth less.

1628
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,760
But the story, just by the frame in

1629
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,760
which I see it means that, oh my god,

1630
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,839
this thing is it's theater. It looks

1631
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,480
like one of one. Yeah, it's theater. and

1632
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:55,200
and some would call it

1633
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,400
manipulative, but we want things to feel

1634
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:01,440
valuable, not just be valuable. Right? I

1635
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,520
could tell you I've got a I I I found a

1636
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,520
guy who makes Kashmir jerseys and he

1637
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,760
uses the exact same cashmere as, you

1638
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,319
know, Laura Piano, whatever, some fancy

1639
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,839
fancy ass brand, you know. But the

1640
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,200
problem is it says like Dave's Kashmir

1641
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:16,480
shop, you know. I could tell you

1642
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,559
everything about where he sources the

1643
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,960
Kashmir, how he makes it. That's the

1644
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:24,480
same everything. And you'd be like,

1645
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:26,240
"Yeah, Dave's Kashmir shop." Because

1646
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,160
you're not buying the Kashmir. You're

1647
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,680
buying the brand. You're buying the

1648
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,520
story. You're buying the association.

1649
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:36,079
That's what's that's why brands have

1650
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,240
value because it's irrational. Yeah. And

1651
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,040
humans are irrational. And that's why

1652
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,359
companies invest in building

1653
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:48,000
brands for the story. And

1654
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:51,520
so yeah, I I think I'm, you know, as

1655
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,200
much as chat AI scares me, I still

1656
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,599
believe the thing that the technologist

1657
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,760
the technologists don't appreciate and

1658
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,520
won't appreciate and there there will be

1659
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,920
a

1660
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:03,640
rebellion and handmade will become more

1661
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,280
valuable and handmade will become more

1662
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:10,559
expensive and people will want to say

1663
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,400
that. You know, it's like you had that

1664
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,240
person write your speech for you. you

1665
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:18,319
wait who did the painting? They they did

1666
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:21,040
it themselves, you know, and I think

1667
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:22,559
that's good. You know, it's a pendulum,

1668
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,400
right? We're going to get enamored with

1669
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,559
the technology until we're until it's

1670
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,839
boring. This also just expands

1671
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,799
generally. I know this sounds quite big

1672
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,720
and we're talking about these big

1673
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,799
things, but just everything that you

1674
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,720
create. It's very very tempting at the

1675
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,880
moment to just create something with AI

1676
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,480
and throw it up on your website, on your

1677
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,480
social media pages, or present it to the

1678
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:43,680
world, a presentation deck at work. But

1679
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,839
actually, I'm I'm already noticing I'm

1680
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,920
attributing huge value and interest in

1681
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,960
things that I can identify as

1682
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,079
humanmade. I had a flashback a second

1683
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,760
ago as we were talking about this idea

1684
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,599
of

1685
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:58,319
scarcity to one of my favorite brands in

1686
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,359
the world. It's a clothing brand and I

1687
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,880
was obsessed with this clothing brand.

1688
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,240
I'd spend a huge amount I don't spend

1689
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,680
money on clothes. I would spend a huge

1690
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,480
amount of money every time they came out

1691
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,839
with a new item. One day the founder of

1692
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,200
the brand and everybody knows this

1693
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:14,000
brand. He posted a photo from his

1694
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,640
factory. It was like a video. And what I

1695
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,960
saw in the video was the shirt I was

1696
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:22,720
currently wearing as I watched the video

1697
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:25,280
in a massive bucket with 4,000 others of

1698
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,040
the exact same shirt. And in that moment

1699
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,119
fell out of love. I fell out of love.

1700
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,440
Exactly. Because in my head, I'd painted

1701
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,760
this like artisan picture of of them

1702
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,839
sewing it. These two guys sewing it in

1703
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,520
their bedroom. And then like it's

1704
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:40,000
probably what it was on the ad, too. I

1705
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,119
think it kind of like used to be. So I

1706
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,040
still had that big. Yeah. One thing that

1707
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,480
I've always understood, this is true for

1708
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,799
businesses, this is true for absolutely

1709
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,319
everything. Scale breaks things. You

1710
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,079
know, scale breaks things in the in the

1711
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,559
military. They they special forces,

1712
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,000
special operating forces, Navy Seals,

1713
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:00,400
SAS, you know, all those folks, right?

1714
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,640
And there's a there's a saying in the

1715
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:07,440
special forces that's basically um

1716
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,960
special you can't scale special right so

1717
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,400
you can take whatever training skills

1718
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,920
whatever you have for the special forces

1719
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,839
and you give it to everybody it's not

1720
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:19,839
going to work special can only be small

1721
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:22,559
you know and and so scale breaks things

1722
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:25,119
scale always so I mean like Microsoft

1723
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,960
versus Apple right so Apple wanted the

1724
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,319
highest quality operating system in the

1725
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,720
world Right? So what did they do? They

1726
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,760
they refused to clone, right? They

1727
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,359
wouldn't they wouldn't they wouldn't

1728
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:40,720
clone their their operating system and

1729
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:43,680
they uh as a result of of refusing to to

1730
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,760
do that they they never for years Apple

1731
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,960
had like in the height of the the PC

1732
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,960
wars maybe 4% of the world's operating

1733
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,480
systems. Microsoft said we're happy to

1734
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,599
clone our operating system. So it was a

1735
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,880
little bit different on Dell. It was a

1736
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,319
little bit different on an IBM. wherever

1737
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,839
you use it was slightly different and

1738
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,319
they had 90 something% of the world's

1739
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,720
operating systems. It's because you have

1740
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:05,440
to trade quality for scale every time.

1741
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,079
There's a reason why buying fancy goods

1742
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,160
for a lot of money like because as you

1743
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,440
said the way you make things has to

1744
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,319
change and you have to start making them

1745
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,760
in factories and you have to scale scale

1746
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,880
scale breaks companies. Think about how

1747
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,000
beautiful companies are. The number of

1748
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,920
companies that talk about, oh, our

1749
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,960
company's like a family. Get to about

1750
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,119
150 people, 200 people, get to Dunar's

1751
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,680
number. Not so much of a family anymore.

1752
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:30,160
I think B2B marketeers keep making this

1753
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,400
mistake. They're chasing volume instead

1754
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,079
of quality. And when you try to be seen

1755
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,520
by more people instead of the right

1756
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,680
people, all you're doing is making

1757
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,079
noise. But that noise rarely shifts the

1758
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,839
needle. And it's often quite expensive.

1759
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,359
And I know as there was a time in my

1760
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:45,280
career where I kept making this mistake

1761
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,599
that many of you will be making it too.

1762
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,520
Eventually, I started posting ads on our

1763
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,440
show sponsors platform, LinkedIn. And

1764
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,359
that's when things started to change. I

1765
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,200
put that change down to a few critical

1766
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:57,520
things. One of them being that LinkedIn

1767
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,839
was then and still is today the platform

1768
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,839
where decision makers go to, not only to

1769
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,359
think and learn, but also to buy. And

1770
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:04,720
when you market your business there,

1771
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,400
you're putting it right in front of

1772
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,880
people who actually have the power to

1773
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,200
say yes. And you can target them by job

1774
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,960
title, industry, and company size. It's

1775
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,319
simply a sharper way to spend your

1776
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,720
marketing budget. And if you haven't

1777
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:18,799
tried it, how about this? Give LinkedIn

1778
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,200
ads a try and I'm going to give you a

1779
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,920
$100 ad credit to get you started. If

1780
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,799
you visit

1781
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,920
linkedin.com/diary, you can claim that

1782
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,920
right now. That's

1783
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:32,799
linkedin.com/diary. Is it harder now to

1784
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,960
find love? Because there's lots of stats

1785
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:37,760
that say we're having less sex, we're

1786
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,440
lonier than ever before. Um,

1787
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,440
interestingly, this is maybe an adjacent

1788
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,720
point, but I was looking at Bumble share

1789
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,559
price.

1790
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,480
I

1791
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:47,760
love the founder of Bumble. The CEO is a

1792
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,359
really really good friend of mine. I

1793
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,400
think she's amazing. Whitney. Whitney.

1794
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:54,000
Yes, I think she is amazing. She has and

1795
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,720
I know her and she's a wonderful human

1796
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,359
being. But when I was looking at the

1797
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,280
Bumble share price, it painted a really

1798
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,480
interesting picture because then you you

1799
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,960
overlay that with some of these other

1800
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:07,280
dating apps and you see I mean this is

1801
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,480
the Well, she's had to come back. She's

1802
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,359
just come back in yet to turn the

1803
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,039
company around. And actually,

1804
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,160
interestingly, I saw her do an

1805
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,520
interview, which is one of these ones

1806
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,520
here. And in the interview, she says

1807
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,319
she's going to revamp Bumble to make it

1808
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,960
not about finding love with others, but

1809
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,160
falling in love with yourself. Yeah. And

1810
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,000
there's also going to be this dating

1811
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,119
marketplace, but her first objective is

1812
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,200
going to be get people to love

1813
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,559
themselves. Yeah. Through coaching and

1814
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,200
all these kinds of things on the app and

1815
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:35,039
then find a partner. Sure. Yes. I mean,

1816
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:37,359
I I agree with that. I mean, it's like

1817
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:39,520
it's I mean, we're all broken records,

1818
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:42,640
right? And I don't mean that as it like

1819
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,319
a like we're all broken souls. Like you

1820
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,720
know you your customers will never love

1821
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:48,240
you until your employees love you first.

1822
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,160
You'll never find somebody to love you

1823
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,240
unless you love yourself first. And look

1824
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,920
at failed relationships right where

1825
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,599
there's so much tension. It's somebody's

1826
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,520
lack of self-love that contributes to

1827
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,119
the failing of that relationship. I mean

1828
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,799
I have a dear friend who's going through

1829
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:05,200
it right now. She just can't find love

1830
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:08,880
and she it just but it's because she

1831
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,240
doesn't love herself and and she knows

1832
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,079
it. You know, it's a hard thing to do.

1833
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,720
So, if Bumble can crack that code, more

1834
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,720
power to him. It's it's a but this is

1835
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,640
the problem with a lot of these things.

1836
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,480
You know, they're common knowledge. We

1837
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,680
just don't do them. Everybody knows how

1838
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,640
to be healthy. Everybody knows how to

1839
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,400
exercise. Everybody knows what eating

1840
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,640
right means.

1841
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:32,720
Don't do it because wrong is easier and

1842
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,920
right takes effort. Everybody knows what

1843
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,200
we're supposed to do in a relationship.

1844
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,440
Everybody knows that we're supposed to

1845
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,799
like hold space. Everybody Everybody

1846
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,079
knows philosophically what we're

1847
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,359
supposed to do, but we don't do it. By

1848
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,720
the way, it's the reason why most people

1849
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,480
I've written all these lovely books and

1850
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,520
it's the reason why most companies don't

1851
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,599
use them. It's because my work is like

1852
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,720
exercise, which is I can tell you every

1853
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,000
single if you want to get into shape,

1854
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,680
hey Simon, how do I get into shape?

1855
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Easy. Every single day, work out for 20

1856
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,200
minutes every single day. Okay. Can I

1857
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,119
take the occasional day off? Yes, but

1858
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,240
not too many. Work out every single day.

1859
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:05,119
And 100% of you will get into shape. I

1860
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:07,359
know it 100%. When? I don't know. And

1861
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,599
neither does any doctor. And that's my

1862
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:12,160
work. Yes, I can profoundly help you

1863
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,599
find purpose with start with Y. I can

1864
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,440
help you build trust on a team with

1865
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,119
leaders at last. I can help you embrace

1866
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,200
the infinite mindset and have this

1867
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,880
incredible calm in life. And the reason

1868
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,240
most companies won't do it, this

1869
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,359
innovate, this is a book for innovation

1870
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,039
right here. You want to innovate?

1871
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,319
Infinite game. The reason most companies

1872
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,760
won't do it is because they need it to

1873
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,760
happen by the end of the quarter or the

1874
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,680
end of the financial year. It may or may

1875
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,640
not. I have no clue and I cannot predict

1876
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,240
that it will or won't. It'll work 100%.

1877
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,839
I just don't know when. And the problem

1878
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,920
is goes right back to the beginning of

1879
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:41,920
this conversation. We're all so obsessed

1880
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,319
with the output. We're all so obsessed

1881
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,119
with the result that we've completely

1882
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:48,640
ignored the value of the journey. And

1883
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,559
people would rather hit the number at

1884
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,280
the end of the year than build a good

1885
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,119
strong company. Think about it, right?

1886
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,319
If I meet another entrepreneur when I

1887
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,000
say, "So, tell me about your company."

1888
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:59,920
Like, "We're hyperrowth. We're a

1889
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,599
hyperrowth company. We're a gazelle,

1890
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,079
right?" Like, "Show me." Then I always

1891
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,599
say the same thing because I'm an ass.

1892
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,680
Can you please give me one article from

1893
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,000
a reputable publication? Just one. And I

1894
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,240
don't care the publication that says

1895
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,640
that building a hyperrowth company is

1896
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:19,079
good for business. Just one. And the

1897
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,440
answer is you can't because it's

1898
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,039
not. And so why are we're so obsessed

1899
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,240
with highspeed growth? It's because our

1900
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,240
investors want us to be obsessed with

1901
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,599
high-speed growth, right? Or our egos

1902
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,200
want us to be obsessed with high

1903
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,119
high-speed growth, right? And if

1904
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,280
high-speed growth happens by accident,

1905
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,680
that happens for many of the unicorns,

1906
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,680
right? It was an accident. I think

1907
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,880
building a good company is better than

1908
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,160
building a fast company. I think

1909
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,960
building a good relationship is better

1910
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:46,480
than building a fast relationship. And

1911
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:49,039
we're all so obsessed with speed and

1912
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,799
immediate results. present company

1913
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,920
included. I've had to learn this the

1914
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:57,760
hard way that I think there's something

1915
01:07:52,920 --> 01:08:00,359
joyful and beautiful about slowing down,

1916
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:03,440
saying thank you, rep prioritizing

1917
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:05,920
friends. It's okay. I mean, by the way,

1918
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:09,039
cell phones and so but before cell

1919
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:11,200
phones, we went to work and then we went

1920
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,640
home and we didn't do work at home

1921
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,760
because we couldn't do work at home.

1922
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,960
Yeah. Because we didn't have computers

1923
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,799
at home and we didn't have cell phones

1924
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:21,759
or people to call us. And so you you did

1925
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:23,199
work at work and then you left. And I

1926
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,679
remember when cell phones started, I

1927
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:28,239
remember the advertising, AT&T had this

1928
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:30,799
campaign that they showed people working

1929
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:33,040
on the beach, you know, with their

1930
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:37,920
computers. I mean, this is like the

1931
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:39,440
future, right? And they said now, um,

1932
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,960
well, I what was the what was the

1933
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:45,120
tagline? It was really funny. It's like

1934
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:47,679
now you can leave work, right?

1935
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,920
And that's not what happened. Work came

1936
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,960
with us. We never left work. Work came

1937
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,400
with us wherever. This is the problem

1938
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,759
with cell phones and computers and the

1939
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:58,960
internet, which is we do not leave work.

1940
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:01,239
Work is with us in our pocket every day,

1941
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,359
every vacation, every evening, every

1942
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:04,400
weekend. As you said that, I thought, do

1943
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,239
you know what that's so interesting

1944
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:10,319
because that kind of means that

1945
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:11,440
friction creates freedom in that regard,

1946
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,839
if you know what I'm saying. So the

1947
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,080
friction of not being able to go home

1948
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,359
and tap away on my computer all night

1949
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,640
meant that I had a certain level of

1950
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,159
freedom because I had to kind of wait

1951
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,000
for things, right? So in the same

1952
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,199
context with AI coming along, now I can

1953
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,480
build software throughout the weekend

1954
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:26,560
whether the agency is working or not.

1955
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:29,199
Now I can build anything I want at any

1956
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,880
time using the phone in my pocket, the

1957
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,880
friction has come down again and

1958
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,359
therefore the pressure to do it now

1959
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,239
because I can do it now goes up. And

1960
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,520
this is kind of maybe what I was

1961
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,719
alluding to earlier on in, you know,

1962
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,159
when I was saying about how you're gonna

1963
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:43,040
get more stressed and more overwhelmed

1964
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:44,560
and more isolated. That's so good.

1965
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,239
That's so right. It's we're taking work

1966
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,679
with us. I mean, it's like, you know,

1967
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:49,279
then everybody has a story of like where

1968
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,799
the battery ran out on their phone and

1969
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,560
they ended up having the best night.

1970
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,719
Yeah. Or the internet went out at work

1971
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,120
and they actually got more done. Like

1972
01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:01,360
you hear these stories all the time, you

1973
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:05,280
know that that when when we're forced

1974
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:07,600
not to take work with us, forced. It

1975
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,080
takes a bit of time sometimes to relax,

1976
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,719
but it's always better because you learn

1977
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:16,159
to stop worrying, stop checking, you

1978
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:19,719
know, you know, and you just I one of

1979
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:21,840
the things I did I I can't delete

1980
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:24,960
Instagram completely as much as I'd love

1981
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,800
to, but I hid it. So, you know, you can

1982
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,440
do that on iPhone. You can take it off

1983
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,120
the It's gone. It's hidden. It says hide

1984
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,159
app. And then I and when you go into the

1985
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,600
search, you know, when you go search

1986
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,120
suggest, I took it off the suggestions,

1987
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,640
which most people don't even know you

1988
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,080
could do that. So, I took it off the

1989
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,120
suggestions. So, when I go to because I

1990
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,239
realized what I was doing is I'm like

1991
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,239
when I'm bored, I just pick up my phone

1992
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:44,000
and I just like and then I see Instagram

1993
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:46,320
like and I just click it like a like a

1994
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,320
zombie and then I'm done for an hour,

1995
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,920
you know? So, I hit it. So, the only

1996
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,800
time I go to Instagram is when I have to

1997
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,760
go to it and I have to type in Nst, you

1998
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,520
know, and then it pops up. And my usage

1999
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:00,840
of Instagram has plummeted,

2000
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,960
plummeted because it has to be

2001
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,440
intentional. And the problem with most

2002
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,120
social media is it's unintentional.

2003
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,840
One of the big things talking about

2004
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:11,320
community, Instagram, AI that I think a

2005
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,239
lot about

2006
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:16,640
is is

2007
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:18,400
the is the value of in real life

2008
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,640
community going to rise? And I I think

2009
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:24,400
we might be on the precipice of the

2010
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,440
community revolution. I say this because

2011
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,960
when I think about what's going to

2012
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,520
remain in a world where creating things

2013
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,679
goes to zero like when you know once

2014
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,239
upon a time if you made a social network

2015
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,840
or if you built an app or if you built a

2016
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:39,280
med a movie or a media company or a

2017
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,480
podcast that was half of the job and the

2018
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,480
other half of the job is like getting it

2019
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,320
out there in the world. Yeah. And so now

2020
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,040
the people that have the other half of

2021
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,320
the job which hasn't gone to zero now

2022
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,679
have this tremendous advantage because

2023
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,000
we can all create but we can't all

2024
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,679
distribute. And so having community and

2025
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,679
building and fostering community I think

2026
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,520
now is one of the things that remains.

2027
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,880
What are the values of a community? Like

2028
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,000
how do I build the community? Well, I

2029
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,199
have a definition of community and I

2030
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,640
think we said it before which is

2031
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:05,360
community is a group of people who agree

2032
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,960
to grow together. Interesting. Community

2033
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,199
is a group of people who agree to grow

2034
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,800
together and I believe friends are at

2035
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,480
least two people who agree to grow

2036
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,679
together. In marketing this is the

2037
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,239
absolute obsession at the moment.

2038
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,400
Community run clubs and yeah brands

2039
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:21,280
becoming um offline is the new online,

2040
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,960
right? Um, offline's the new black. Um,

2041
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,000
like there's a there's a company called

2042
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,600
Clicks and it was started by she's a

2043
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,640
talented entrepreneur and she was in

2044
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,360
college and she suffered severe

2045
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,560
depression and loneliness and literally

2046
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:36,800
struggled didn't know how to make

2047
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:40,239
friends and uh she oh I just call her by

2048
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,719
her name. Her name's Alex. Um but her

2049
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:44,880
company clicks she started it to solve

2050
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:48,239
her own problem right my favorite kind

2051
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,679
of company. and basically to help her

2052
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,760
friends at school, quote unquote

2053
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,440
friends, people at school make friends.

2054
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,800
And she did it by taking people offline

2055
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,840
and taking their phones away. And she

2056
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,040
would come up with reasons to come

2057
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,400
together, whether it was running or this

2058
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,320
or that. Just like it didn't matter what

2059
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,760
the reason was. Come and just a reason

2060
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,360
to come that made you that when you saw

2061
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,159
the ad hung up on a piece of paper at

2062
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:10,960
college, you know, they' be like, I

2063
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:13,199
like horror movies, whatever. I like

2064
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,320
baking. I'll go to that. Right? Just a

2065
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,239
trick.

2066
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,800
and then basically just and so she's

2067
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:20,000
built this business predominantly for

2068
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,920
young people but it's available to

2069
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,280
anyone but she's built this business to

2070
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,159
just bring people together to meet

2071
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,760
people without phones offline and she

2072
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:29,520
want she has and there's a great irony

2073
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,360
in it she has an app that she wants

2074
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,800
people not to be on you know and what is

2075
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,800
it that holds the community together is

2076
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,159
it so like sh we want to improve

2077
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,960
together so we have to have some kind of

2078
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:43,920
shared value that we want to improve on

2079
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,280
presumably it's like a community of

2080
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,719
runners. They're trying to get fit

2081
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,960
together or they're trying to improve

2082
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:51,040
their I don't think it matters. I mean,

2083
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,440
it's like it's it's shared shared

2084
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,400
interests is a is a is a way to start a

2085
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,880
a relationship, right? Comic-Con, you

2086
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,679
know, you know, Nerd Vana, you know,

2087
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,920
Burning Man, all of these larger than

2088
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,920
life events, big and small, going to the

2089
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,600
going to the going to the football, you

2090
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,040
know, it's like you're everybody's

2091
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,199
friend when you wear when you wear the

2092
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,800
right when you wear the right colors,

2093
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:14,400
you know. You know, you see people on

2094
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,600
the on on the tube who's going to go

2095
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,760
into the same game. They're wearing the

2096
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,679
same jersey, your friends. Yeah. Your

2097
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,000
friends, right? So, I think common

2098
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,040
interest is a is a is a trick. It's a

2099
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,480
way of getting people to come together.

2100
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,480
And it's a nice place to start because

2101
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,920
at least conversation is easy, right?

2102
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,960
You know at least one thing about this

2103
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,880
person that you have in common with

2104
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,159
them. Do you need a shared goal in a

2105
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,840
community, do you think? Thinking

2106
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,120
because in the football analogy, we have

2107
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,640
a shared goal. Oh, yeah. You want to

2108
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,920
win? I think that's a very good

2109
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,760
question. Do you have a shared goal even

2110
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,760
in a relationship? Yeah, I think so.

2111
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,840
That seems to make sense. The reason why

2112
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,159
I'm asking these questions is I am

2113
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,520
building businesses and brands. And I

2114
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,960
know that community is one of the most

2115
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,320
important things that everyone building

2116
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,960
a brand or business is thinking about at

2117
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:55,040
the moment. So there's a big difference

2118
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,560
between having an audience, which is

2119
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,120
what you might have on like a podcast or

2120
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,040
something, and having a

2121
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,400
community. And I'm as a brand leader and

2122
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,719
as an entrepreneur, I'm trying to shift

2123
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,239
from having an audience over to having a

2124
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:08,679
community. And that's about like

2125
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:12,080
relationships and shared values. Shared

2126
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:12,080
values. I

2127
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:16,880
mean, I like to think the people who

2128
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,000
really like my work, not the ones who

2129
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,640
just like passively like it, but the

2130
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,320
ones who really like my work, like if

2131
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:27,679
somebody says, "I love Start with Y or I

2132
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,040
live my life by the infinite game." that

2133
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,640
it says something about who they are and

2134
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,880
how they see the world and that we share

2135
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:37,239
the same values and that if and because

2136
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:42,640
I am you know me you know I'm an

2137
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:44,000
idealist and and my I I'm consistent in

2138
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,040
the way I talk about things from the day

2139
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,199
I started to to now and won't ever

2140
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:52,320
change and and I think that's the value

2141
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:53,600
of values and the problem with the

2142
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,840
modern world we live in and the

2143
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,520
pressures that people face is money and

2144
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,679
fame and all the rest of it and you know

2145
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,159
influencer status. I think it sometimes

2146
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,560
forces us to question our values or walk

2147
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:06,000
away from them. I was invited to a a

2148
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,360
group of they called it a mastermind

2149
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,520
group where it's a bunch of folks like

2150
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,360
me author speakers who wanted this is

2151
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,320
what they told me come together based on

2152
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:16,080
shared shared goals shared values how we

2153
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,920
can work together to improve the world

2154
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,800
together and I'm like oh sign me up I'm

2155
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,320
in right so I went and we sat around and

2156
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,840
you know who some of these people are

2157
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,360
you know and we sat around a room and

2158
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,960
they spent all of their time talking

2159
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,920
about how they can share their lists

2160
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,920
with each other and how they can

2161
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,800
cross-promote with each other and what

2162
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,239
margins are you getting on this? And I'm

2163
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,440
like, you guys are and I spoke up. I was

2164
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:39,679
like, you guys are just talking about

2165
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,679
making more money. What? I thought we

2166
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:46,000
came here to like do common good

2167
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:48,480
together. They didn't invite me back.

2168
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,080
But it was but the point is is like the

2169
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,920
money and the fame is seductive. You

2170
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,840
know this is this is this is this is

2171
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,239
Joseph Campbell's hero's journey which

2172
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,400
is you start off as the reluctant hero

2173
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:01,520
and you get called to your mission for

2174
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:05,040
some reason and at some point in your

2175
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,880
journey there will be something seduce

2176
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,440
you away from your mission money or

2177
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,560
power you know Luke Skywalker was nearly

2178
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:14,400
seduced away from the vision you know

2179
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,360
from the journey like this is what this

2180
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,840
is what the hero has to go through and

2181
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,840
do you have the friends who will slap

2182
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,320
you around and keep you in line and say,

2183
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,600
"No, you signed up for this. You have to

2184
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,120
stay true to what you're doing." Because

2185
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,360
I think none of us have the courage or

2186
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,440
the strength to stay true to our cause

2187
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,880
by ourselves. Very few of us. We need to

2188
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,040
have at least one person who believes in

2189
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:37,120
us to give us the strength to stick to

2190
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,960
it because the temptation the temptation

2191
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,000
you and I have both at various times

2192
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,679
gone through it like when you start

2193
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,360
making money and you start making money

2194
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,199
for something you didn't expect. Like I

2195
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:47,320
never expected to have a career from any

2196
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:49,760
of this stuff, right? It happened by

2197
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:51,520
accident. And you get to the point where

2198
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,320
you start thinking you're more important

2199
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:58,080
than you are. Do they know? Do they do

2200
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:00,800
they know who I am? No. No. Get over

2201
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,560
yourself. You know, and you start

2202
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,560
becoming seduced. And I think the

2203
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,960
seduction when we turn on social media

2204
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,960
and we watch

2205
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,560
Kardashian, the Kardashian model, and

2206
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,520
like you have people who pursue

2207
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,199
influence without knowledge or skill,

2208
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,400
like those two buckets. They have the

2209
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:18,159
other three buckets, but they don't have

2210
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,640
the first two buckets. And it is

2211
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:24,800
temporary for some or unfulfilling for

2212
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:27,120
others. And you know the funny thing

2213
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:31,199
about that job, you know, I was I was I

2214
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:32,640
went to a concert and there was this

2215
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,920
this woman who walked down the aisle and

2216
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,920
some guy was taking pictures of her and

2217
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:39,040
she was posing and the person next to me

2218
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,640
goes, "She's a famous influencer." And I

2219
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,520
said, "You mean she's a freelance

2220
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,520
employee of an algorithm?"

2221
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,360
And and somebody who chooses to be an

2222
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,199
influencer, that's what you are. You are

2223
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,320
a freelance employee of an algorithm.

2224
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:58,840
And the minute they change the

2225
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,840
algorithm, you might be out of business.

2226
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:07,760
Uh you just lost like 170 followers.

2227
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:10,800
I mean, maybe you just lost like 170

2228
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,840
blue ticks. But like I don't have a

2229
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,760
problem with the concept of being an

2230
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,159
influencer if you bring something of

2231
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,520
value. The only time I have a problem

2232
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:21,920
with it is is if you make it about you

2233
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,159
and I have to get more of everything. In

2234
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,159
the early days of influencing, there was

2235
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,840
a young couple that were trying to get

2236
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:30,679
followers and they would do crazier and

2237
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,199
crazier things. And

2238
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:34,400
so what they did is he took a d a big

2239
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,159
book, a dictionary I think it was, and

2240
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,800
he put it over his chest and she took a

2241
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:41,120
gun and shot it at the book thinking

2242
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:43,360
that the book would stop the bullet. And

2243
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,400
she killed him. She killed him on

2244
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,440
camera. right

2245
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,719
now. They admitted she admitted

2246
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,000
afterwards she he's dead. But she

2247
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:51,520
admitted afterwards they were doing it

2248
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,560
to do bigger and crazier stunts to get

2249
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,400
more and more followers because the

2250
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,760
financial pressures of driving at those

2251
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:01,120
YouTube views was overwhelming. And so

2252
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:03,840
it's an extreme case obviously of the

2253
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:06,800
the the the the how we will lose our

2254
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:09,239
minds trying to gain followers. And I

2255
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,159
don't mind if people gain followers by

2256
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:14,080
giving but to gain followers by taking.

2257
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,600
Look at me. Look at me.

2258
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,280
versus I have something that I think

2259
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,520
this will help you. And like there's not

2260
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:23,840
there's I don't have a problem with what

2261
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:27,000
it's it's the it's the input, right?

2262
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:30,320
It's the intention.

2263
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,640
Um anyway, anyway, I sound like an old

2264
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,800
man complaining about No, but you kids

2265
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,159
these days and you were influencers. S I

2266
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,159
printed off some graphs which I think

2267
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:39,440
are absolutely fascinating and dovetail

2268
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,960
into everything you've said today, but

2269
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,400
also into your work generally. So, I'm

2270
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,000
just going to give you all of these to

2271
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,080
give you a second to look through them

2272
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,280
and I want to get your read and

2273
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:50,960
interpretation on them. Okay.

2274
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,360
Adults lack of meaning and purpose.

2275
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:56,239
Overall,

2276
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:58,000
lonely. Okay. I mean, that makes sense.

2277
01:20:56,239 --> 01:21:01,520
To me, that didn't make sense. I

2278
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:05,280
couldn't understand how if someone is

2279
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,880
low in purpose, then they are lonier.

2280
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:10,000
I mean, it just makes sense that when

2281
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:12,960
you have lack of purpose, the likelihood

2282
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,800
that loneliness comes nearby. Like, I

2283
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,840
think family gives meaning, friends give

2284
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,080
meaning. Like, you feel like you're

2285
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,199
there for someone else. Um, but if you

2286
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,280
don't know why you're showing up every

2287
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,640
day, I think it it it feels like a

2288
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,080
lonely existence. Like, you feel like

2289
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,400
you're searching. When you have a sense

2290
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,760
of purpose, it gives you a mechanism to

2291
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,960
meet people. It gives you a mechanism to

2292
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,320
make decisions. It gives you a mechanism

2293
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,840
to talk about yourself in a way that's

2294
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,280
quite inspiring to others. You know,

2295
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,120
when you say your why and somebody says,

2296
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,880
"So, what do you do?" So I I wake up

2297
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,880
every single day to inspire people to do

2298
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:43,360
what inspires them. What do you do? You

2299
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:45,360
know, like it's it's I Yeah, I do. I do.

2300
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,560
And I think it's it's not the thing that

2301
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,480
makes you less lonely. I think it's a

2302
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,040
mechanism to make you less lonely. Just

2303
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,719
as you said that that why you just gave

2304
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,239
it becomes a magnet for me. Yeah.

2305
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:55,920
Because then I know who your people are

2306
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,440
and I know what to talk to you about and

2307
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,679
it throws down this bridge for me to

2308
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,280
walk across. Yeah. Versus Yeah. I'm a

2309
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:03,280
dentist

2310
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,520
or I don't know. Which is even worse.

2311
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,679
which is even worse. Yeah. Yeah. So, so

2312
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,120
yeah, that that doesn't seem unusual.

2313
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,520
Distribution of people feeling lonely

2314
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,080
worldwide by gender. So, it's about

2315
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,880
50/50.

2316
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,239
Are you surprised by that? I thought

2317
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,000
for some reason I thought men were more

2318
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:24,600
lonely.

2319
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,800
Not at all lonely. Looks like women do

2320
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,000
better. I would think. Do you think you

2321
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,600
thought men were more lonely? I thought

2322
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,440
men would be more lonely. I al I also

2323
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,760
don't know what the age groups are cuz

2324
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,280
like I want to know what how they like

2325
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,480
what age are they to start are they

2326
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:40,159
starting at is it 18 I guess if we just

2327
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,840
put that all aside I mean women being

2328
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:45,360
slightly less lonely than

2329
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,520
men I think makes sense because I think

2330
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,920
women are probably better at making

2331
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,520
friends maybe I have that wrong what

2332
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,920
else we got here adults mental health

2333
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,760
health ratings 68% of people who have

2334
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,719
depression are lonely and 67% of people

2335
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:01,480
have anxiety are lonely do you think

2336
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:05,280
good mental health is a foundation for

2337
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:07,520
being not lonely, I guess. No, I think

2338
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,920
having somebody who cares about you is a

2339
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,920
foundation for not being lonely. And

2340
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,639
when you're in a period of strained

2341
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,679
mental fitness, it definitely can

2342
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:19,199
manifest as loneliness and

2343
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:21,679
anxiety. And the best way to manage

2344
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:23,800
through that period of is to lean on the

2345
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,159
people who you know love you. That will

2346
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,080
help. So I don't think you can separate

2347
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:30,639
the two. So does it affect it? Of course

2348
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,440
it affects it. Can it make you withdraw

2349
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,120
from your friends? Of course it

2350
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,440
can.

2351
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:39,760
Um so I don't think you can separate the

2352
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:42,239
two. I read um a couple of years ago

2353
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,760
that when people are lonely, they fall

2354
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:46,560
into a state of self-preservation

2355
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,080
because of some evolutionary uh sort of

2356
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,840
mechanism which meant that if we were

2357
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:53,520
alone on the Serengeti in Africa, we

2358
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,120
would sleep worse. We'd become more

2359
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,560
selfish. We'd become more angry. our

2360
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,080
cortisol levels will be up which means

2361
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,440
more inflammation. And this idea of

2362
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,120
self-preservation basically means that

2363
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,360
lonely people become more selfish, more

2364
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,920
bitter, more angry. And that that's not

2365
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,120
conducive, ironically, with finding more

2366
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,120
friends, but it is conducive with

2367
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:11,199
survival. It is conducive with being

2368
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,880
able to fend for yourself. It makes it's

2369
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,800
more conducive survival as an

2370
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:17,440
individual. Yeah. So like if you're in a

2371
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,199
deserted island and you're lonely and

2372
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:22,560
all those things and the cortisol rises

2373
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:24,400
and you become better at being on edge

2374
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:27,679
being on edge which is a survival

2375
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:29,800
mechanism right but if you live in a

2376
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,920
community with other people then it is

2377
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:34,159
counterproductive because we are social

2378
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,159
animals and I need you to help me and

2379
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:39,040
you need to help me. So if we live in

2380
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,880
tribe together and I'm the selfish

2381
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,639
[ __ ] I'm not you're not going to

2382
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,639
wake me and alert me to danger tonight.

2383
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:46,800
Mhm. you're just going to leave me. So,

2384
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:49,679
so it's a it's a it's a though I think

2385
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,760
it's 100% true in a social environment

2386
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,880
it becomes counterproductive. And I

2387
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,239
think you're right. When somebody feels

2388
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,440
lonely, they do go into survival and

2389
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,560
they become paranoid and they think

2390
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,080
everybody's out to get them. And it's

2391
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,840
but the problem is is you don't live on

2392
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:02,560
a desert island. And that's one of the

2393
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,960
reasons I think it's it's dangerous.

2394
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,960
We're increasingly being living on

2395
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,040
islands. The islands are different now.

2396
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,360
They're four walls in a in a white city.

2397
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:13,000
And um it's so funny that so many of my

2398
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,840
friends are using this word

2399
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,120
loneliness when 10 20 years ago it

2400
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,600
wasn't it wasn't something that I heard

2401
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,880
frequently from from adults but now it

2402
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,080
seems to be also common. In fact my

2403
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:27,120
masseuse yesterday was saying to me that

2404
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:30,080
she's lonely and this is a woman that

2405
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,760
lives in Los Angeles has people around

2406
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,520
her but she's lonely. Yeah. And I

2407
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,719
remember when she went and she's cuz we

2408
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,159
had a conversation and I text her and

2409
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,600
said oh thank you for for being so open

2410
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,360
and stuff. I was thinking about like

2411
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:42,320
what advice I could give her. She's got

2412
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,520
no friends. She's in Los Angeles. She's

2413
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,960
desperate for friends. She doesn't have

2414
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,639
a partner anymore because she's had a

2415
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,120
divorce. What advice do you give

2416
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:51,120
someone? Is it take more risks? So, it's

2417
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,639
it's too it's easy to give the obvious

2418
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,080
advice like you got to put yourself out

2419
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,159
there, right? But when you're in a

2420
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,080
period of loneliness and stress, it it's

2421
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:59,600
hard to find that that energy and that

2422
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,040
risk takingaking, right? Especially when

2423
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,560
you're down on yourself. We've all been

2424
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:05,440
there. I've definitely been there. But

2425
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:08,000
the um I think for me what I've learned

2426
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,679
is um to put myself second meaning don't

2427
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,880
worry don't try and solve my problem but

2428
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,440
do I have somebody else who's lonely

2429
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,760
that I can help like how do I help

2430
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,800
somebody else who's dealing with their

2431
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:19,199
loneliness and it's the act of service

2432
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,120
that is so valuable if you know you guys

2433
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:22,719
are talking and she has many clients and

2434
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,800
somebody else like and her willing to

2435
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:27,760
admit that I'm lonely that one of her

2436
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,440
clients might say you know me too like

2437
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,639
her ability to admit her loneliness out

2438
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,159
loud creates a safe environment for

2439
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,520
somebody else to admit the

2440
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,840
And then once she learns that they're

2441
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,679
lonely, now she can say, "Tell me about

2442
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,000
it." And then she can talk them through

2443
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,600
it and hold space for them. And her

2444
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,040
ability to help somebody else manage or

2445
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,040
understand their own loneliness will

2446
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,560
will help her. So interesting because

2447
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,920
one of the hallmarks of her personality,

2448
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,920
if you met this person, something she

2449
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,880
says to me every single time she comes

2450
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:55,040
over um for the treatment is that she

2451
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:56,719
doesn't like sharing herself with people

2452
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,719
because she thinks if people get to know

2453
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:01,280
her, they'll change. So literally, she

2454
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:03,440
has been my misuse for many years now.

2455
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,880
And if people get to know her, they will

2456
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,239
change. She's scared about people

2457
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,760
knowing her. She's scared about people

2458
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:10,320
knowing the details of her life. So, she

2459
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,840
guards it all. And it's it took me, and

2460
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,560
I'm someone that just asks way too many

2461
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,040
questions of every student I meet.

2462
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,960
It took me like 20 sessions just to

2463
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,800
figure out she had a family. I had no

2464
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,639
idea she had two kids. Took me She goes,

2465
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,760
And when I asked her, her her body

2466
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,280
language went like

2467
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,880
this. Yes, I have kids. And I was like,

2468
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,480
why why are you so guarded with your

2469
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,920
information? Well, if people know who

2470
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,560
really I really am and they know more

2471
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,920
about me, then they'll change or um they

2472
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,199
may not like me anymore or they'll think

2473
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,560
differently about me. So, I just keep it

2474
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,920
to myself. But, I mean, this is the

2475
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,120
age-old problem. I mean, it's everything

2476
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,560
you said when you when people who are

2477
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:45,040
driven only by the thing that they want,

2478
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,080
you know, versus the givers. And this I

2479
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,360
mean, this is the age-old problem, which

2480
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,560
is I'm never I'm going to keep my walls

2481
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,080
up high. I never want to love anybody

2482
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:52,080
because then I'll get hurt. And then you

2483
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,080
just end up learning and hurt. And this

2484
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:56,880
is this is goes this this is goes back

2485
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:59,360
to struggle which is this goes look you

2486
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,800
and I both know that that if somebody

2487
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:04,159
who chooses to go on an entrepreneurial

2488
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:07,040
venture or ad venture the statistics

2489
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:08,280
bear out that the over 90% of all new

2490
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,120
businesses will fail in the first three

2491
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:12,560
years right what idiot would ever start

2492
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:15,520
a business right you have to be

2493
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:18,080
compelled by something else to make you

2494
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:20,960
do something with overwhelming stat

2495
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:23,920
statistical chance of failure right and

2496
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:26,560
And it's opening yourself up to failure

2497
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:30,080
that is the thing that makes it work you

2498
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,920
know at least for a small percentage of

2499
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:34,239
course but it's the same for love which

2500
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:37,520
is or a relationship or friendship which

2501
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:39,679
is it absolutely comes with risk there's

2502
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:42,000
nothing risk- free like yeah they will

2503
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,719
they some of them might change yes some

2504
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,760
of them might not like you for that very

2505
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:49,040
yes

2506
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,320
yes and the odds are equal that somebody

2507
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,520
will fall in love with you and love you

2508
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:53,679
and like you and think you're the best

2509
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,280
thing and think you're amazing. And so

2510
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:56,639
if you can't take the risk, you can't

2511
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,760
get the reward. If you don't play the

2512
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,280
lottery, you don't win the, you know,

2513
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,120
you don't win the jackpot. If you aren't

2514
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,639
willing to take, I'm not telling you to

2515
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,719
open up and tell everybody your deepest

2516
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,040
darkest secrets. But if you're not

2517
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:09,199
willing to give somebody anything to

2518
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:14,040
latch on to to be like if you can't give

2519
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:16,480
them anything to say me too,

2520
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:18,880
then then it's going to be a hard road

2521
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:21,840
or it'll take somebody to chip away at

2522
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,840
you 20 times, you know, to before you

2523
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:26,159
open up. But but the fact that you did

2524
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,000
and she got her to open up a little bit,

2525
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,679
she could make a friend in you. Now

2526
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,800
she's fully open and we've been through

2527
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:32,639
everything. I know where she wants her

2528
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,840
house to be. Well, there you go. You see

2529
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,159
that thing down? So, you have to point

2530
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,520
out to her that this friendship and that

2531
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:41,520
you know so much and that she feels so

2532
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:43,600
safe with you only happened because

2533
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,159
um you chipped away at her and she

2534
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,760
finally you wore her down and she opened

2535
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,679
up. And it can happen in two directions,

2536
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,960
right? Which is sometimes we have to

2537
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,960
take the little risk to just tell

2538
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:56,159
somebody some a little something about

2539
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:58,080
ourselves to find something. Or

2540
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:59,440
sometimes it's somebody who's so curious

2541
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,400
about us that they chip away and chip

2542
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,000
away and chip away and chip away and

2543
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,000
chip away until we give up and open up

2544
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,239
and that that person becomes a friend,

2545
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,440
you know, and so one of the reasons you

2546
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:08,719
should be grateful for the friendship is

2547
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,159
you kept trying. You could have just

2548
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:11,440
tried it three times and like forget it.

2549
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:15,520
I'll just lie here quietly and have a

2550
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:17,600
massage, you know. So yeah, I mean all

2551
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,600
of this stuff comes with risk. I could

2552
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,920
see it in her face though. I could see.

2553
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,280
But you're also curious. Yeah, I could

2554
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,760
see this. She locked out because you're

2555
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:28,080
curious about people. Is this what

2556
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:30,320
connection is? You when you said me too,

2557
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:32,320
finding something to say me too with

2558
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:36,480
someone, is that the essence of what

2559
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,520
like connection is? I mean, it can mean

2560
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,199
it could be values, it could be

2561
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,440
interest, it could be many things. But I

2562
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:43,679
think to

2563
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:46,320
find I think yes, like this is I mean,

2564
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:49,760
if you want to go political, you know,

2565
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:51,520
one of the problems in our politics is

2566
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,960
both sides think they're right and both

2567
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,920
sides think the other side is wrong.

2568
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:58,400
Mhm. And neither side is willing to try

2569
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,159
to even understand what the other

2570
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,520
person's point of view is without

2571
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,840
thinking them an idiot or thinking them

2572
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,159
wrong or thinking them

2573
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:08,560
sheeple. And the ability to say, "Can

2574
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:11,040
you tell me more about how you came to

2575
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:14,639
your beliefs? I'm genuinely curious."

2576
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:17,199
and to not agree or disagree, but to be

2577
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:20,239
curious, to be an investigator, you

2578
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:22,400
know, and I and I have done this with

2579
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:25,440
people who have polar opposite political

2580
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:27,440
views with me. At some point, we will

2581
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:29,199
get to a level of me just chipping away

2582
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,280
trying to understand that they will say

2583
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:34,000
something that I'm like, 100% I agree

2584
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:35,760
with that. M and then from that point on

2585
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,880
there's a there's a simple validation

2586
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,639
not agreement but a validation that your

2587
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,639
opinions do matter and we do have common

2588
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:45,280
ground that we can build from there and

2589
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:46,880
on that on that validation they become

2590
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,560
vastly more open to my point of view

2591
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:52,719
also and curious to my point of view

2592
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:54,719
also and so yeah the person the person

2593
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:57,679
like the ability to listen and be

2594
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,199
curious even if you disagree is one of

2595
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,199
the most underappreciated skills on the

2596
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:03,360
planet and yeah I think when you find

2597
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:05,040
the ability to say I agree. Then you can

2598
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,679
find community. You can and maybe that's

2599
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:09,600
what we need to heal this country or

2600
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:13,440
most of the countries in the world right

2601
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:15,280
now which is one group or one person to

2602
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,639
just be curious rather than agree or

2603
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,320
disagree. There's something about

2604
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,159
relationships here as well because my

2605
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:22,480
girlfriend is you've met my partner and

2606
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:24,159
um she's very spiritual but also like

2607
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,320
all of us she's emotional. So sometimes

2608
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:28,080
in those interactions when we sit down

2609
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,840
and there's a problem and we spend the

2610
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,600
first 60 minutes to 90 minutes trying to

2611
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:34,159
figure out what the problem is. It

2612
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,320
doesn't sound very logical to me. And

2613
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:38,000
one of the things that I think sort of

2614
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:40,159
is adjacent to what you're saying is my

2615
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,199
job in that moment actually isn't to

2616
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:46,880
like pass through truth and to figure

2617
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:50,320
and to correct truth. It is to sit and

2618
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:52,880
let someone get it out. Get it out. So

2619
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:56,159
you and I have the same problem.

2620
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,920
We do. Which is we live above our necks.

2621
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,040
Yeah. And you and I both have the same

2622
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,280
struggle, which is to learn to live

2623
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:03,600
below our necks, right? Like you and I

2624
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:05,760
are head people and we have to learn to

2625
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,840
be more heart right and I want to

2626
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,000
understand everything explain everything

2627
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,760
you know evaluate everything analyze

2628
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,840
everything and when I come to my

2629
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,120
emotions I'll give you an analysis you

2630
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,120
know when it comes to your emotions I'll

2631
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:20,080
give you an analysis and so I have to

2632
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,760
learn to be like I feel this and that's

2633
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,880
it and I feel the same way it's funny

2634
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,239
because I'm good at it with art you know

2635
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,440
I always tell people you don't have to

2636
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,960
understand art I'll take you to a museum

2637
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,800
I'll take you to a gallery and if you

2638
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,480
look at a piece and I know you're

2639
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,159
intimidated to come because you don't

2640
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,440
understand art or you don't understand

2641
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:35,520
music, whatever it is. And all you need

2642
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,560
to do, this is the only rule, is do you

2643
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,560
like it? I

2644
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:43,360
do. Why? I don't know. I just like it.

2645
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,719
That's it. You're done. You're done. I

2646
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,520
don't like it. Why? I don't know. I just

2647
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,960
don't like it. Great. Excellent. And now

2648
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,560
we're going to look at four, five, six,

2649
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,000
10 pieces that you like. And I'm going

2650
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,480
to see four, five, six, 10 pieces that

2651
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,560
you don't like. And I'd be like, you

2652
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,400
like all of the impressionists and you

2653
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:00,639
hate all the old masters. So why don't

2654
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,280
we just go see more impressionists, you

2655
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:05,360
know? And so when when your girlfriend

2656
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,239
opens up to you, you know, you don't

2657
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,159
have to agree. You don't have to

2658
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:10,960
disagree. You just have to and you and I

2659
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:13,360
both have to learn to stop thinking and

2660
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,560
to just like feel something. When

2661
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,679
somebody says, "Where do you feel it?"

2662
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,719
I'm like, "What? That's the stupidest

2663
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:18,560
question I've ever heard. Where do I

2664
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,840
feel it?" And they've literally like

2665
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,600
I've had somebody take me on this

2666
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,080
journey and she goes, "You told me an

2667
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:27,440
emotion you have, Simon. You told me an

2668
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:30,320
emotion." Yes. Where do you feel it in

2669
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:32,560
your body? Where do you feel it? And I'm

2670
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:35,600
sitting there going, "You've got to be

2671
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:38,320
kidding me." You know, but all right,

2672
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,159
we'll go through this. All right. And

2673
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,920
she says, "So you said you feel X." I'm

2674
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:44,120
like, "Yes." All right. Where in your

2675
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:47,760
body did you have some sort of reaction?

2676
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:51,600
I here. What happened? It got a little

2677
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:54,320
tighter in my chest. Okay. And I went on

2678
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:58,040
this journey with my friend with my

2679
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:00,400
friend Bea. Beavce. She's she's

2680
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,560
incredible. And she took me on this

2681
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:05,120
journey and she does repair with couples

2682
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:07,280
and she's just incredible. And she

2683
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:10,520
helped me recognize that my body does

2684
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:13,159
react to my feelings. Tension in my

2685
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:16,400
shoulders, heavier breathing in my

2686
01:35:13,159 --> 01:35:19,120
chest, clenching my fists, you know,

2687
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:21,000
like my body does react. And so I'm

2688
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:24,400
learning to

2689
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,400
experience feelings beneath my neck when

2690
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,480
my inclination is to do everything above

2691
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:30,000
above the neck. It's a hard skill. Oh my

2692
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,760
god, it's hard. And so I have for men.

2693
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,280
And so when you're when you meet

2694
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:39,760
spiritual people, they are all below the

2695
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:41,360
neck and we think it's stupid, but they

2696
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,880
recognize that we have an ability to

2697
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:45,360
feel because we want to think about

2698
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,960
everything. And so we both have a lot to

2699
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,360
learn from each other which is there the

2700
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:52,639
thinking about things has value not all

2701
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:55,480
the time. And so your girlfriend and I

2702
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:59,679
because I know her ability

2703
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:02,000
to know her body when she has feelings I

2704
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,760
think is way more is has a lot of value

2705
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,760
to you and to me. I think it's like the

2706
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,360
biggest opportunity I have to form

2707
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,639
relationships. Yeah. Yeah. Change in

2708
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,800
number of posts for automationprone jobs

2709
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,600
compared to manual intensive jobs. So

2710
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:20,520
this is a graph that shows the drop in

2711
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:23,199
job postings online for jobs around

2712
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,640
automation is yeah the knowledge work is

2713
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:27,239
going to get hammered by AI.

2714
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:30,040
[Music]

2715
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:31,560
Um I met a guy in

2716
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:35,679
Japan

2717
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:37,600
who he's one of the very few guys left

2718
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:39,920
like a hundred of them left 150 of them

2719
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,520
left who makes samurai swords in the

2720
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,600
traditional samurai sword way you make

2721
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,520
them. hammer them metal and he folds his

2722
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,560
own metal and he makes samurai swords.

2723
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,480
They made them the way they made them

2724
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:50,880
200 years

2725
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:53,199
ago. And we went to this little workshop

2726
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:55,760
and he's this little old guy and he's

2727
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:57,280
telling us the story like how did you do

2728
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,639
this? He's like well I had a desk job. I

2729
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:00,320
worked in a company and I woke up one

2730
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,119
day I was like I can't this I can't do

2731
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,560
this. Like this is this can't be my

2732
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:07,400
life. And I just I've always been

2733
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:11,520
enamored by sword making. I found an

2734
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:13,760
apprenticeship and tried to learn and

2735
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,360
you know I'm I I'm just starting to get

2736
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,360
the hang of it and but I have a lot of

2737
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,400
room for improvement. And we're like how

2738
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,520
long have you been doing this? He said

2739
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:23,199
30 years. 30 years. But that's so

2740
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,400
Japanese, you know, the Japanese like

2741
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:26,800
they'll never be good at this. I'll just

2742
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:28,880
keep working at it. And and like it's

2743
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:31,600
such hard work.

2744
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:34,880
But he I think there's something to be

2745
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,320
said for I think a lot of us like think

2746
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,760
about how many white uh knowledge

2747
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,280
workers like ask them what their hobbies

2748
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,520
are

2749
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,520
you

2750
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:46,800
know and like maybe there is an

2751
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:48,320
opportunity to learn a skill. I mean

2752
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,880
look at look at look at lockdown when we

2753
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,639
all went through lockdown. I mean what

2754
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,520
skill did you practice during lockdown?

2755
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:56,840
What did you learn? DJing, running,

2756
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,440
cycling.

2757
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:03,199
DJing.

2758
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:04,960
DJing, right? I did kugi, but it's the

2759
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:07,600
Japanese art of fixing broken things

2760
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,840
with gold. So, basically, you take a

2761
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,800
broken plate or broken cup and you put

2762
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:15,119
it together and with gold paint or gold

2763
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,440
epoxy, you put it together and you make

2764
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:19,840
it. The whole concept is you can make

2765
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:21,199
something more beautiful. Like, things

2766
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,119
can get more beautiful after they're

2767
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:25,760
broken, right? I love the philosophy of

2768
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:27,280
it. I spent hours doing freaking Kugi.

2769
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,760
Ask me how much Kugi have done since we

2770
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:33,320
came out of lockdown. How much DJing

2771
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,320
have you done? Zero.

2772
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:38,400
And so maybe all this free time that

2773
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,719
we're supposed to get, which I still

2774
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:42,280
don't think will

2775
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:44,239
happen, maybe it's not such a bad

2776
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:46,719
thing. Think about the joy you had

2777
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:48,639
DJing. I had so much fun doing kinugi. I

2778
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:52,600
had so much fun. I would spend hours

2779
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:55,679
just my head down, focused. I was so

2780
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:57,679
relaxed, not thinking about work. So why

2781
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,360
why that's the other question we talking

2782
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:01,360
about how we're all going to have all

2783
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:03,199
the spare time. We've lost all of our

2784
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,560
spare time. We have no spare time

2785
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:07,440
because all we do is work and think

2786
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,360
about work and talk about work. Like if

2787
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,360
we go back 40 years, 50 years, there was

2788
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:13,199
plenty of spare time and people went

2789
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,560
bowling and they went to the movies and

2790
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:18,760
they went over to each each other's

2791
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,760
houses for dinner and they cooked.

2792
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,920
Isn't it a good thing that we're getting

2793
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:28,960
time back? You know, a lot of us got a

2794
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:31,800
lot of con good things out of lockdown

2795
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:34,639
and that's extreme. So like

2796
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:36,159
maybe maybe it's okay that we get some

2797
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,000
time back because it sounds like we've

2798
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:39,040
lost all of our own time. It'd fix the

2799
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
loneliness. You'd have space for

2800
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,679
relationship. You'd have space for

2801
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,760
relationships. You'd have space to try

2802
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:46,080
things and we couldn't bury ourselves in

2803
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:49,199
work and escape from our lives that we

2804
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:52,159
hate by just burying ourselves in work.

2805
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:54,560
Maybe maybe AI doing some of the work

2806
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:57,320
for us is the thing we've been desperate

2807
01:39:54,560 --> 01:40:00,560
for for the past 30

2808
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:00,560
years. Just

2809
01:40:00,679 --> 01:40:04,960
saying this is quite embarrassing for me

2810
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,560
to admit, but if you know me well,

2811
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,400
there's something that you know about me

2812
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:10,320
which is a function of my personality

2813
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,679
and that is that I lose everything. I've

2814
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,600
lost my wallet. I've lost multiple

2815
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:15,119
passports. I now actually have two

2816
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,560
passports because there's a high

2817
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:18,080
probability of me losing one. And when

2818
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,520
you lose your wallet overseas, as I have

2819
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,040
many times, it's a particular

2820
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,400
inconvenience because you also lose your

2821
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,760
driving license and your credit cards

2822
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,679
and those kinds of things. And that's

2823
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,600
why I'm so happy that our show sponsor

2824
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,360
Extra have invented this thing I have in

2825
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,760
my hand. They have partnered with

2826
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:34,400
Apple's Find My Technology. So, all I

2827
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,159
have to do is open their app and play a

2828
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:38,560
noise and it will tell me where my

2829
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:40,320
wallet is. Extra wallets are slim.

2830
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,639
They're made of recycled aluminium and

2831
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,800
they block various types of digital

2832
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:47,600
theft. And with one click, your cards

2833
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,880
can pop up and are ready to go. So, if

2834
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:51,600
this sounds like the kind of thing you

2835
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,840

2840
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,560
likes matcha, for anybody that likes

2841
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:07,040
lattes, one of my companies has just

2842
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,800
launched canned matcha lattes. And I was

2843
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:10,560
speaking with the founder, Marissa, and

2844
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,040
she said that creating this product has

2845
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,679
been no easy feat. They tried launching

2846
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:17,360
in 2021, but as is often the case in

2847
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,600
business, the development process turned

2848
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,840
out to be extremely complex. So, they've

2849
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,920
spent the last four years testing and

2850
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:26,639
refining every single detail to create

2851
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:29,840
this, which is a perfect Ted matcha

2852
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:31,679
vanilla latte and a perfect Ted matcha

2853
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:34,320
strawberry latte. So, what we have here

2854
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:36,080
in these cans is barista quality matcha

2855
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,520
straight from the can. And it tastes

2856
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:40,000
like it's just been made from your

2857
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:42,159
favorite cafe. Naturally sweet and

2858
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,440
naturally creamy in a can. And the

2859
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:45,440
reason why I've invested in this company

2860
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,199
and I drink matcha is because matcha as

2861
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,040
an energy source gives me lasting energy

2862
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:50,560
without the big crashes that I get from

2863
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,480
other products. Grab their ready to

2869
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,920
this season of life? I think I've asked

2870
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:11,199
you this in every conversation we've had

2871
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:14,560
and the answer's evolved conversation to

2872
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:17,520
conversation. Yeah, we'll both go.

2873
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,920
I'm doing so much right now. By the way,

2874
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:23,040
absolute

2875
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:24,960
joy and I wish I had more time in a day.

2876
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:26,320
And not in the sense that I'm dep

2877
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,920
prioritizing my friends. You know, you

2878
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,280
talked about how you you know, you you

2879
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,480
would give them all your money to to

2880
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,480
secure them, but you don't give them any

2881
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:34,000
time. I actually treat a lot of I've

2882
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,119
actually gotten very good at this. It's

2883
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,080
probably when you write a book about

2884
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:39,040
friendship, you sort of like take

2885
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:41,199
yourself on a little bit where I I will

2886
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,639
schedule friends like meetings in the

2887
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:46,679
middle of the day. Haven't seen a friend

2888
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:48,600
for a while. Um 4:00 in the

2889
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:52,080
afternoon, tea

2890
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:53,440
with I go and I leave the office like

2891
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,880
I'm going to a meeting because nobody

2892
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,480
says, "Hey, Simon, where you going?" Go

2893
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,920
to a meeting. Where you having the

2894
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:00,320
meeting? At that restaurant. People like

2895
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:02,400
have fun. Nobody will give me any kind

2896
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:04,000
of grief if I'm leaving to go to a

2897
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,040
meeting.

2898
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,639
Now I go and see a

2899
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:10,000
friend and and when somebody says can I

2900
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:11,679
cancel this French tea with friend

2901
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,440
because that you have a phone call you

2902
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,600
have to I'm like no just like you

2903
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:19,119
wouldn't cancel on my meeting don't

2904
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:21,360
cancel on so I treat I I put it in and I

2905
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:22,800
give them equal waiting to things that I

2906
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:25,199
have to do at work because I become much

2907
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:27,520
more discerning like do I have to have

2908
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:29,600
this meeting or this phone call today or

2909
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:32,960
can I do it next week? I could do it

2910
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:35,719
next week. And you realize we fake we

2911
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:38,400
fake ur we add fake urgency to

2912
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:41,800
things and I I have a friend who's kind

2913
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,639
of amazing. He he's way busier than me

2914
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:46,080
and

2915
01:43:43,639 --> 01:43:47,679
he he says I don't want to spend time

2916
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,960
with anybody like I saw I saw it was

2917
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,400
really funny. He came out of a meeting

2918
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,480
and it was he had a meeting with a very

2919
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:55,520
fancy person who's who's courting him

2920
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:58,719
for business, right? Or he should be

2921
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:00,639
courting the other guy actually.

2922
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,679
very fancy person and he comes out of

2923
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,960
the meeting. I'm like, "How was it?"

2924
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,159
He's like, "Total waste of time." I'm

2925
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,840
like, "You don't want to do business?

2926
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:07,280
You he doesn't want to work with you?" I

2927
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,600
was like, "No, he wants to work with me.

2928
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,040
He wants to work with me badly. Total

2929
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,159
waste of time." I'm like, "What are you

2930
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:15,719
talking about?" I was like, "He's just

2931
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:18,480
some rich [ __ ] Like, I learned

2932
01:44:15,719 --> 01:44:19,679
nothing. I didn't enjoy it and I don't

2933
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,760
want to work with them." And I was like,

2934
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:23,679
"Tell me more." He's like, "I only want

2935
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,840
to work with people who when I spend

2936
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:29,040
time with them, they teach me something.

2937
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:31,040
I laugh or I feel inspired when I walk

2938
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:33,520
away. And if somebody is sucks my

2939
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:36,960
energy, I do not want to I do not want

2940
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:39,920
to work with them. And I was like,

2941
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,920
that's amazing to have that level of

2942
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:45,679
confidence that you would turn down

2943
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:47,280
money in your business. And and now what

2944
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:49,520
if we applied that to as much as

2945
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,880
possible in our lives? Like what if we

2946
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,719
stopped hanging out with friends who

2947
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:56,239
just sucked our energy? Are they really

2948
01:44:53,719 --> 01:44:58,560
friends? rather than spend more time

2949
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:00,080
with people who we enjoy. What if we

2950
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,679
take meetings from people we're excited

2951
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:04,320
to take a meeting with, not that we just

2952
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,920
see dollar signs and opportunity? And

2953
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:08,400
what if we only partner with companies

2954
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,080
where we really like the people who are

2955
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,880
who work at those companies? Doesn't you

2956
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,719
don't have to have a relationship with

2957
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,159
the CEO, but I really they've got a good

2958
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:15,520
culture. I really like working with them

2959
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:19,199
and we make a little less money with

2960
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,480
them versus that other company, but I I

2961
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,880
really like them because when things go

2962
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,239
wrong, I want to call that person. And

2963
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,440
and people ask me this all the time.

2964
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:26,880
They say, "How do I choose a publisher?"

2965
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:29,440
And I've seen this mistake a thousand

2966
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,119
times. I've seen people like like former

2967
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,800
CEOs who are like, "I now I'm going to

2968
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:34,480
write my book." I'm like, "Great. You've

2969
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,880
got a lot to say." And they've got

2970
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:38,400
multiple offers and there's a bidding

2971
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,600
war. And they always ask me, "Which one

2972
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,199
should I go with? Which publisher should

2973
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,400
I go with?" And I always say the same

2974
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:44,719
thing. Choose the one you're going to

2975
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,080
fight with best. Choose the publisher

2976
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:47,600
you're going to fight with best. They're

2977
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:49,119
like, "What?" I'm like, "The goal is to

2978
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,639
make a good book. There's going to be

2979
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:52,800
creative tension. There's going to be

2980
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,080
fights. Choose the the the publisher who

2981
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,159
you believes in your idea, believes in

2982
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,000
you, wants to make a great book, who

2983
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:59,679
you're going to fight with really well.

2984
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,520
They every single one of them ignores

2985
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:03,040
me. Every single one of me takes the

2986
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,400
biggest bid. And every single one of

2987
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,600
them has written a shitty book that

2988
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:07,840
didn't sell. Isn't that just

2989
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:10,560
relationship advice as well, though?

2990
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,760
Probably. Yeah.

2991
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,679
Choose the person you're going to fight

2992
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,159
with best.

2993
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:18,239
And the the the number of times that we

2994
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:21,119
forget about the quality of the product

2995
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:23,280
and we just want the it's the same it's

2996
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:25,119
the same for job interviews. You know,

2997
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:26,800
don't take this is especially true for

2998
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:29,119
for young people. Like when you're

2999
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:32,040
interviewing in in in a relatively

3000
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:33,840
junior job, entry level or slightly

3001
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:36,320
above, don't worry about how much

3002
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:39,080
they're going to pay you. Like just as

3003
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:42,639
long as they pay you a livable wage, you

3004
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:44,960
know, choose the job. Choose the job

3005
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:47,040
based on who you're going to work for.

3006
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,320
Choose the person. I used to in early on

3007
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,199
in my career, people, you know, HR

3008
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,800
people would say, "What are you looking

3009
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:52,480
for?" I always I'd always say the same

3010
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,840
thing. I said, "The thing that I'm

3011
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:56,320
looking for is probably like looking for

3012
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,760
love, but I'm looking for a mentor." And

3013
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,600
every time I would evaluate a job, I

3014
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,719
didn't care how glamorous the brand was.

3015
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,679
I didn't care how much money they were

3016
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:03,040
going to pay me. And by the way, it's

3017
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,920
not like I had money. I knew they were

3018
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,360
going to pay me something. I knew I

3019
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,199
could pay my bills. It's not like I've

3020
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:09,280
got I'm not a I'm not a trust fund baby.

3021
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:11,040
Like, I needed I needed an income. Mhm.

3022
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:13,520
But one company offered me, you know,

3023
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:15,199
$5,000 more and one company offered me

3024
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,119
$5,000 less, but I really like the

3025
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:20,000
person over here. I took that job. And

3026
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:22,800
it was a simp if I got one thing right

3027
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,719
as a as a as a as a young person, it's

3028
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,159
that I always chose jobs based on who I

3029
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:27,840
would work for, not how much they were

3030
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:30,000
going to pay me or what account or what

3031
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,760
brand I was going to work on.

3032
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,199
And that's the one thing I got right

3033
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,119
because yes, I made less money than all

3034
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:37,840
my friends in the short term, but I got

3035
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:39,600
a I got a I got an education and a care

3036
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,960
and a love from somebody who took me

3037
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:45,840
under their wing. I am a I am I am I

3038
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,119
learned leadership from Dennis Glennon.

3039
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:49,440
I learned leadership from Peter and

3040
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:51,520
Tomaggio. I learned leadership from

3041
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:53,920
Pamela Muffet. I learned leadership from

3042
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,360
these leaders who took a weird liking to

3043
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,119
me and took me under their wing. And

3044
01:47:55,360 --> 01:48:00,239
they were exceptionally good leaders

3045
01:47:57,119 --> 01:48:01,840
themselves. and I got that education and

3046
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:03,960
all of them in the early days paid me

3047
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:07,840
less than I could have got somewhere

3048
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:09,920
else and it's the same choose the people

3049
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,280
in my um my book that I wrote I was the

3050
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:14,320
first chapter in it talks about this

3051
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:15,920
idea of these five buckets and I'm

3052
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:17,360
giving I'm trying to give young kids

3053
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,480
advice on how to prioritize their career

3054
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,520
and it sounds somewhat similar to you so

3055
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:22,639
I'm going to throw this concept at you

3056
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,840
and see see how it lands with you so the

3057
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:25,280
idea was that we all have these five

3058
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,960
buckets when we're starting our career

3059
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,480
and the first bucket is your knowledge

3060
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:31,760
the second bucket is your skills. Now,

3061
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:33,360
these are the f the only buckets that

3062
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:35,360
no professional earthquake in your

3063
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,960
career can unfill. You can be fired, you

3064
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,159
can be cancelled, whatever. You still

3065
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,679
have your knowledge and skills. But the

3066
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:42,320
other three buckets I'm about to name,

3067
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:46,080
they can fluctuate. Bucket number three

3068
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:48,159
is your network can fluctuate. Bucket

3069
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,600
number four is your resources can

3070
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:51,920
fluctuate. And bucket number five is

3071
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:53,920
your reputation can fluctuate. And the

3072
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:56,000
idea is that focusing on those first two

3073
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,840
buckets when you're young optim choosing

3074
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,280
jobs based on how much they're going to

3075
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,800
fill those two buckets and also what

3076
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,719
they're going to fill them with and how

3077
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,080
relevant that information is. And when

3078
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:06,400
knowledge is applied, it becomes a

3079
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,679
skill. So you focus on filling your

3080
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,360
knowledge. You apply that knowledge into

3081
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:11,119
skills and that really is the essence of

3082
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:13,119
career longevity. And as I noticed over

3083
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:14,400
time with people that I I hired and then

3084
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:17,440
watched them throughout their careers

3085
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:19,840
and what they did, it seems to me that

3086
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:22,080
life over the long term typically brings

3087
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,760
you back down or up to the level of your

3088
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,440
knowledge and skills. I.e. I had this

3089
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,960
one kid stepped down from my company

3090
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:29,040
because he got a job offer at 21 to go

3091
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,560
be a CEO in America. And as he departs,

3092
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,480
I'm thinking he has not got the

3093
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,400
knowledge and skills to be a CEO. Within

3094
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,320
24 months, the company had gone bust. He

3095
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:38,159
was back down to doing the same job he

3096
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:39,280
did for me. And I thought life just like

3097
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:41,840
resets you to the level of your

3098
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:43,280
knowledge and skills over time. So what

3099
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:44,639
do you think of this? Are these I think

3100
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,480
we're saying the exact same thing. You

3101
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,760
did it more eloquently than me, you

3102
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:53,119
know. I think I think it's 100% right.

3103
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:55,199
Uh um and the people who will fill that

3104
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:57,199
bucket with knowledge and skills are the

3105
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:58,719
people who again for some reason they're

3106
01:49:57,199 --> 01:50:00,480
good people. They're good leaders. They

3107
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:02,040
take a liking to you and they will give

3108
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:04,159
you they will put you in

3109
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:06,480
situations and they will let you screw

3110
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:08,719
up and fix your own problems. fix your

3111
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:10,480
own mistakes. Then that's what my bosses

3112
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,320
did for me. They rewarded my behavior

3113
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:14,239
when I got it right as opposed to my

3114
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,679
results. Never got rewarded for my

3115
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:17,760
results. I always got rewarded for my

3116
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,760
behavior. So if I showed initiative, I

3117
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,400
got a I got a reward even if the results

3118
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,840
didn't follow right. And I could there's

3119
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:25,280
I can tell you a great story on that.

3120
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:27,880
And if I got things wrong, they would

3121
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:30,080
say, "Hm, wow, what are you going to

3122
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:32,719
do?" Really screwed that one up, didn't

3123
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:36,239
you? Okay, what are you going to do? And

3124
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:38,320
they didn't they weren't happy with me,

3125
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:39,520
but they let me fix my own messes and

3126
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:41,520
they stood by and I knew that they were

3127
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:43,040
there if I needed them. You know, Peter

3128
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,960
and Tomaggio, one of the best leaders I

3129
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,880
ever worked for, annoyingly he never

3130
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,159
answered a single question I asked. Hey,

3131
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,199
Peter, what should I do? I don't know.

3132
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:50,480
What do you think we should do? Well, I

3133
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:52,880
think we should do this. I'm like, okay,

3134
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:55,199
so go do that. You know, what do you

3135
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:57,040
think, Peter? I'm asking you because I

3136
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:59,199
don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

3137
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:01,920
He's like, well, should probably go

3138
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:03,040
think about that. He was he it was the

3139
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,119
worst. But what he taught me was

3140
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:07,280
self-reliance. What what he taught me

3141
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:09,440
was self-reliance. What he taught me was

3142
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:11,199
if I don't know then I have to go keep

3143
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:13,760
searching and keep talking to people. I

3144
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:16,320
have to have a point of view. Mhm. And

3145
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,480
may not be right and I'll find that out

3146
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:19,760
myself too. And I also learned to have

3147
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,560
backup plans from him because something

3148
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:25,840
went haywire on me and it went so wrong.

3149
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:27,360
It ended up being okay. But they he made

3150
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,600
me sweat it. And I remember at the end

3151
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:30,880
of the day, at the end of this whole

3152
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:34,119
thing that went wrong. That was totally

3153
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:36,320
my fault. The phone rings. I see his 6

3154
01:51:34,119 --> 01:51:37,360
p.m. phone rings. I see his name come up

3155
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,480
on the caller ID. And I pick up the

3156
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:41,199
phone. I remember the whole call word

3157
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:44,400
for word. Right. Pick up the phone. I

3158
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:47,840
go, "Hello." He says, "Close call

3159
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:49,360
today." I said, "Yep." He said, "Better

3160
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:52,000
to get shaved by the bullet than hit by

3161
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:55,280
the bullet." I went, "Yep." He said,

3162
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,080
"Have a good night." I said, "You too."

3163
01:51:55,280 --> 01:52:00,159
That was the whole phone call. And so

3164
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,760
since then, since that experience, I

3165
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:02,800
always have a backup plan. Now, it

3166
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:04,239
doesn't mean it's all ready to go, but

3167
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,560
I've thought about if this thing that

3168
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:09,280
I'm trying to do doesn't work, what will

3169
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,800
I do? And I have at least committed some

3170
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,199
thought to it. So, if if something does

3171
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,320
go wrong, I'm like, I'm a little bit

3172
01:52:12,199 --> 01:52:16,080
ahead. Either have it planned or I'm

3173
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,360
like, okay, okay, don't worry. I kind of

3174
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:19,440
if this happened, I thought about this

3175
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:22,080
already. And it's only because of these

3176
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:23,280
great leaders. And it goes, this is this

3177
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,880
recurring theme of this whole

3178
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:27,040
conversation, which is it's the

3179
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:29,119
struggle. It's the journey, not the

3180
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:30,960
destination. It's the human beings that

3181
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:33,199
guide us. It's the human beings that

3182
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:35,040
hold space for us that make us better

3183
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:37,199
what we do better better than how we

3184
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,880
show up in the world. And AI will

3185
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:41,360
absolutely make our lives easier. Like

3186
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,880
most technology makes our lives easier.

3187
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,719
That's kind of the role, the rule of

3188
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,080
technology, which is to make life a

3189
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:48,400
little easier, a little more efficient,

3190
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:50,800
a little quicker, a little less, you

3191
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:53,280
know, strain on the muscles. you know,

3192
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:56,159
that's kind of what it does, you know,

3193
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:58,000
from the from the plow, you know, all

3194
01:52:56,159 --> 01:53:00,040
the way up to the internet and AI. It

3195
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,239
just makes life a little

3196
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:03,840
easier. But we're still human beings who

3197
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:05,040
are forced to live with human beings.

3198
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,920
You're writing a book about friendship

3199
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:09,119
that we're all waiting for. Yeah. I'm

3200
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,960
not going to ask you when it's due cuz I

3201
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:12,880
don't want to be your publisher, but um

3202
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,119
I know that they they chase and chase

3203
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,800
and chase and chase, but my I guess my

3204
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,840
closing question is why? Of all the

3205
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,360
things you could have written about,

3206
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,880
Simon, you're someone who's able to

3207
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,239
traverse se several subject matters

3208
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,840
across business and life and everything

3209
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:27,040
in between, but you've committed

3210
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:30,159
yourself to the struggle of writing a

3211
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:32,119
book about friendship. Mhm. There's an

3212
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:34,159
entire industry to help us be better

3213
01:53:32,119 --> 01:53:36,719
leaders, right? There's an entire

3214
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:38,480
industry to help you have a successful

3215
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:41,159
relationship or successful marriage or

3216
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:43,760
even find a partner, right? Industries,

3217
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:45,840
books, companies.

3218
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:48,960
There's very little on how to be a

3219
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:50,960
friend. And if you think about if you're

3220
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,440
going to have a successful career and

3221
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,960
can and can survive the stresses of

3222
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,480
career and if you're going to have a

3223
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,320
successful romantic relationship or

3224
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:00,360
marriage and survive that, do you know

3225
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:02,800
what what you need in both of those

3226
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:04,320
circumstances? Friends. Because when

3227
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:05,840
your marriage is falling apart, you go

3228
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:08,719
to a friend. When your job is falling

3229
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,840
apart, you go to a friend. When and and

3230
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:12,239
there's a few things that I've

3231
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:15,199
discovered about friends that I find

3232
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:18,239
delightful. And I have been reorganizing

3233
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:19,840
my life to as I and I mentioned it

3234
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:22,000
before like I've been reorganizing my

3235
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:24,000
life to ensure that my friends aren't

3236
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,320
taken for granted and that sometimes I

3237
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,440
do depp prioritize work in order to see

3238
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:29,840
my friends and spend time with my

3239
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:32,400
friends because I know it feels good to

3240
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:35,040
them and I know it feels good to me and

3241
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:36,880
I know that the only reason I can get

3242
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:38,000
through any work stress or personal

3243
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,760
stress I have is because of those

3244
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,880
magical human beings and I will not take

3245
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:47,040
them for granted and um doesn't I mean

3246
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:49,119
it's always easy. I'm conflicted often

3247
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,480
but I'm trying. And I also know if you

3248
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:52,000
look at the work the world today and

3249
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,599
like there's so much conversation about

3250
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,760
loneliness, depression, anxiety,

3251
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:57,840
inability to cope with stress, even the

3252
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,239
obsession with longevity. Like there's

3253
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,599
so much about these subjects and some

3254
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,520
people treat it with drugs and then

3255
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:05,520
meditation and vacations and burn. Like

3256
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:08,599
there's so many theories. The one thing

3257
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:10,800
that fixes all of those things is

3258
01:55:08,599 --> 01:55:12,880
friends. Friendship is the ultimate

3259
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,560
biohack. You know, we've talked about

3260
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:17,119
this before. I fundamentally believe

3261
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,639
that. And if it's so valuable, like if I

3262
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:21,599
know if you know vegetables are good for

3263
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:23,440
you, you eat more vegetables. If you

3264
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:24,960
know exercise is good for you, you do

3265
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:26,920
more exercise. So if I say friends are

3266
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:29,360
good for you, shouldn't you do more

3267
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:31,599
friendships, right? Like shouldn't you

3268
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:34,080
exercise is not fun or easy and you have

3269
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:36,199
to get over a hump sometimes? Eating

3270
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:38,560
vegetables can sometimes be boring and

3271
01:55:36,199 --> 01:55:41,440
unsatisfying, but you do it and you find

3272
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:44,239
new ways. And so maybe friendship is not

3273
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:46,560
always easy or fun, but it's still

3274
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:47,760
really really good for you. And it the

3275
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,599
best thing about friends is it actually

3276
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,040
doesn't taste like spinach. It's like

3277
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:52,560
you get the benefits of spinach, but it

3278
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:55,040
tastes like chocolate cake. If you get

3279
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,639
friendship right, it's it's the

3280
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:59,040
healthiest thing in the world. How do I

3281
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:01,280
know if someone's a friend?

3282
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:03,040
Have that conversation with them because

3283
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:04,719
I know a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. I

3284
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:06,000
mean, like, and you have deal friends,

3285
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:07,599
you know, you have a lot of deal

3286
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,800
friends, you know, podcast friends.

3287
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:12,320
Podcast. Yeah. uh work friends, you

3288
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,080
know, and you and we have and not look,

3289
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,960
I'm not talking about there's all kinds

3290
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:16,159
of friends. There's friends that you

3291
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,199
just like hanging out with. They're just

3292
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:19,520
fun, but you're not going to go with

3293
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:20,880
them with your problems or to sort out,

3294
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,320
you know, issues. You're not you're just

3295
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:26,239
not work or personal. They're just fun,

3296
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:28,400
right? There's nothing wrong with that.

3297
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:30,000
Um, but I think, you know, I'm certainly

3298
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:32,400
guilty of spending time with people

3299
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,760
that, you know, they fill a space and

3300
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:36,119
they make me feel not lonely, but at the

3301
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:39,520
end of the day, I don't feel

3302
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:41,040
smarter, inspired, brighter, lighter

3303
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,719
when they when I say goodbye. I'm just

3304
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:44,159
like, "All right, bye. That was fun."

3305
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:46,800
And I kind of want to spend more time

3306
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:49,599
with people who lift me, teach me,

3307
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,040
support me, love me, give me a give me a

3308
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:53,360
chance to serve. They open up to me and

3309
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:56,920
let me serve as well. You know, I

3310
01:56:53,360 --> 01:57:00,440
struggled to make friends and I

3311
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:02,760
think Do you know why? I

3312
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:06,800
think

3313
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:08,880
I I think I'm lazy with it. Lazy with

3314
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:11,920
friendships. So, I will meet someone,

3315
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:14,239
I'll have a great connection with them

3316
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:16,719
and then my followup like I don't really

3317
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:19,679
know what to do next. So, I'll meet your

3318
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:21,199
followup is crap. Oh, [ __ ] But this

3319
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:23,199
is what I mean. Like my I'll meet

3320
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:26,639
someone. I'll text you and maybe I'll

3321
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:30,760
get a response. Vice versa.

3322
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:30,760
I think you left me on red.

3323
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,800
But you you're the same. Are you the

3324
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:36,960
same or is it just with me? It's just

3325
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,320
with me. It's just with you. But but I

3326
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,679
think my follow-up game is like crap.

3327
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:41,760
I'll meet someone. I'll go, "Oh my god,

3328
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:45,280
I'll see I'll see the potential for a

3329
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,880
friendship and then I won't know what I

3330
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:49,440
have." Or maybe I'm just being lazy. I'm

3331
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,040
trying to I want to be honest. So I I I

3332
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,639
maybe I just don't prioritize it enough.

3333
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:55,960
I think also when you start having fame

3334
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:59,599
and money and you're used to being the

3335
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:01,520
boss, you get away with stuff. So you

3336
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:03,119
show up late, everybody's like pissed

3337
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,159
off and angry and then you show up and

3338
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,920
they're like and you're like sorry. Like

3339
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:07,520
no, no, no, don't worry, don't worry.

3340
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,360
Right? Like you get away with stuff in

3341
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:11,520
the world, right? And so I think what

3342
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:13,520
that does is I see this with celebrities

3343
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,880
all the time, right? Because everybody

3344
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,000
yeses them to death and they get away

3345
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,000
with it and nobody ever holds them

3346
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,360
accountable. At some point they just get

3347
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
lazier and lazier and lazier because

3348
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:23,119
they can. Oh yeah. You know. Yeah. And

3349
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,639
so they don't have to put in the effort

3350
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:27,520
because other people put in the effort.

3351
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:31,239
Yeah. And nobody bees like like somebody

3352
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:34,239
who's a nobody won't say to them, "Yo,

3353
01:58:31,239 --> 01:58:36,480
[ __ ] Not respectful. What? You think

3354
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:38,440
my schedule doesn't matter? I've been

3355
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,560
waiting here for 3

3356
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:42,239
hours. Just because you're a celebrity,

3357
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,159
you think you can just keep me waiting?

3358
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:45,440
Not cool. Nobody says that to them."

3359
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:47,040
Yeah. And somebody should say that to

3360
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:48,480
them. But uh they should say it to

3361
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:50,639
themselves. They should say it to

3362
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,920
themselves. That would be ideal. And

3363
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:52,719
some of them have the self-awareness to

3364
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,920
know they're getting away with it.

3365
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:55,360
That's even worse cuz then they're doing

3366
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,719
it on purpose. At least blindness, I

3367
01:58:55,360 --> 01:59:00,560
think. You know, they can at least hide

3368
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:03,360
behind ignorance. But, uh, yeah, I mean,

3369
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,480
friendship takes effort. Yeah. There'll

3370
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:06,560
be a lot of people listening now, I

3371
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:08,239
know, that understand. I think they'll

3372
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,920
resonate with what I'm saying, which is

3373
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:11,599
I'll meet someone, I'll be like, we

3374
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:13,280
could be really good friends. I see so

3375
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:15,679
much in us. I love what you stand for.

3376
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:18,960
We we have so much in common. and then

3377
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:21,679
it drifts because neither party have the

3378
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:23,679
tools or the skill of like what to do

3379
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:25,440
then. We also live in a strange world

3380
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:26,880
where I've met people where I have all

3381
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:28,239
of that and I follow up like

3382
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,280
immediately. I'm like, "Hey, I had such

3383
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:30,880
a good time. Let's make a plan." And

3384
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,280
they're like, "What? Huh? What?" Or I

3385
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,239
call as opposed to like texting. And

3386
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,599
people like, "What? Why are you

3387
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:38,320
calling?" Like, "Well, we we had a nice

3388
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:40,000
time. I thought we'd maybe talk, you

3389
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:42,000
know, and I think we live in this

3390
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,599
strange world where people put it out

3391
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,719
there, but they don't really want it."

3392
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:46,320
Looping us right back to the beginning

3393
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:48,480
of this conversation as you said that

3394
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:50,960
about the call. That made me think again

3395
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:54,080
about how this going to become a premium

3396
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:56,480
on human because calling is so archaic

3397
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:58,400
to me that when someone does it, it's

3398
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:00,080
like a treat now. And I was thinking

3399
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:02,159
what's what's taking that even further

3400
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:03,360
would be writing someone a letter. If

3401
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:05,040
someone Do you know who wrote me a

3402
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,400
letter? Evan from Snapchat came on the

3403
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:08,080
podcast, the founder and CEO of

3404
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,000
Snapchat. And then by the time I'd got

3405
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,679
back to London, there was a letter on my

3406
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,840
desk from Evan and it just said, "I had

3407
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:15,199
a great conversation with you. Um, thank

3408
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,320
you for being so thoughtful with the

3409
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:17,679
questions. Thank you for the research.

3410
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:19,440
Here's my number. would love to stay in

3411
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:22,599
touch. Yeah. And it blew me away. AI

3412
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,599
wrote that.

3413
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,199
No, it was with He had an auto pen. He

3414
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:28,239
just It was with a pen. I had a

3415
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:29,679
signature and his phone number. I

3416
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:32,239
thought that is so beautiful. It's

3417
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:34,880
classic. It's classic and classy.

3418
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:36,239
There's a premium on being human.

3419
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,520

02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:57,119
coming up sometime soon yeah we'll go

3432
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,480
out for sure it'll be fun we have a

3433
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:59,920
closing tradition which nearly forgot I

3434
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:01,119
do know the tradition which is the last

3435
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,960
guest leaves a question for the next

3436
02:01:01,119 --> 02:01:06,320
guest yes what's my question what are

3437
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:09,440
you doing in your life to mentor someone

3438
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:12,000
coming up behind you and Then who is a

3439
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:15,159
person that you'd like to mentor, teach,

3440
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:19,599
or coach that needs your voice the

3441
02:01:15,159 --> 02:01:21,040
most? I it's it's my team is everything

3442
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:22,639
right now. Like I want to give

3443
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:25,840
everything I've learned to my team. I

3444
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:28,480
want the folks on my team to benefit

3445
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:30,719
from all the mistakes I've made. And one

3446
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:31,719
of the joys of being in founder mode

3447
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:36,719
when it's

3448
02:01:31,719 --> 02:01:38,560
not the the actual beginning is I have

3449
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:42,320
way more in my skill and knowledge

3450
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:44,000
bucket that I want to pour out. And so I

3451
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:48,239
one of the reasons I'm having so much

3452
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:49,599
fun in founder mode is because I want to

3453
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:51,520
give away everything that I've learned

3454
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:53,520
so that my team can be stronger and

3455
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:54,800
stronger and better and better cuz I

3456
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:58,239
want to leave something that can survive

3457
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,520
me that you know if if I you know the

3458
02:01:58,239 --> 02:02:00,800
whole school bus test you know if the

3459
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:03,920
founder gets hit by a bus will the

3460
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:05,440
company continue or will it not and I

3461
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,599
really want to build something where

3462
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,599
they want to build it without me. Feels

3463
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:11,840
like there's been a change here. M what

3464
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:12,960
was the catalyst? For the past couple

3465
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,920
years, I've been just trying out a lot

3466
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:18,000
of different things to find to to find

3467
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,840
uh a level of excitement and energy that

3468
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,159
I think I'd lost for a little bit and I

3469
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:25,360
found it. Like this has been like the

3470
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:27,520
founder mode. My team are so great and

3471
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:29,440
they so want to they so want to push

3472
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:31,119
boundaries and all I want to do is take

3473
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:33,199
take the reinss off like take the leash

3474
02:02:31,119 --> 02:02:34,400
off. Like I want them to experiment. I

3475
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:35,520
want them to try things and I'm trying

3476
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:37,760
to create an environment where they're

3477
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:39,280
creative. They do things. Half of them

3478
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,800
will fail. I don't care. Let's try

3479
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:44,080
again. And I I just love being around

3480
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:46,320
all the creative ideas that they're

3481
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:47,760
coming up with. My team asked you to

3482
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:49,040
bring something that meant a lot to you,

3483
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,599
and you brought me this. And I don't

3484
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,599
know what's in this

3485
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:57,520
box.

3486
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:04,000
Oh, two medallions. Medals. Mhm. Those

3487
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:05,440
are military challenge coins. Um, I

3488
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,719
brought the one, the round one, just to

3489
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:10,080
show you what the traditional ones look

3490
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:11,199
like. Um, uh, this is the one I care

3491
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,599
about. I mean, I care about them both,

3492
02:03:11,199 --> 02:03:16,480
but this is the one I brought. So, these

3493
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,840
are, uh, only generals or commanders

3494
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:20,239
will give these out. They're hard to

3495
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:23,440
get. You get them when you do something

3496
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:24,560
of service. It's, it's less formal than

3497
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:26,320
a medal. They can give it out to

3498
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,239
whomever they want. And it's their way

3499
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:29,679
of saying thank you. And the challenge

3500
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:30,800
coins that I've been given, I'm very,

3501
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:32,480
very proud of because I feel like I

3502
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:33,520
earned them. And the thing that I love

3503
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,440
is when they give them to you, they

3504
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,880
don't just hand it to you. They put it

3505
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,639
in their hand like this and they shake

3506
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:39,400
your

3507
02:03:37,639 --> 02:03:41,520
hand. Go

3508
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:43,280
on. And that's how they give them to

3509
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:44,400
you. And they say, "Thank you, Simon, so

3510
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:46,800
much for coming here and helping us

3511
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:49,199
out." And that's how they give me the

3512
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:52,080
coin. The reason this one means a lot to

3513
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:54,239
me is because I did some work with the

3514
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:55,880
with Air Force Top Gun. It's called the

3515
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:58,159
Weapons School, but it's Air Force Top

3516
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:00,960
Gun. And this is their coin and this is

3517
02:03:58,159 --> 02:04:02,159
their patch. That's And um I did some

3518
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:03,840
work with them to help them get to the

3519
02:04:02,159 --> 02:04:05,520
core of their why, what their true value

3520
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:07,280
was. just to make sure that their

3521
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:09,040
culture stays clear and good for a long

3522
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:11,199
time. And we came up with three words,

3523
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:12,960
three actions that everybody who goes

3524
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:15,520
through Air Force Top Gun is required to

3525
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:18,800
do, which is build, teach, lead, which

3526
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:20,400
is the idea that you build a skill set,

3527
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,639
you teach that skill set to other

3528
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:24,960
people, and then you build leaders and

3529
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:26,400
you lead, right? This whole idea that

3530
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,560
you have you have a responsibility to

3531
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:31,440
build, to teach, and to lead, accumulate

3532
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:33,520
and give and serve. And the thing that

3533
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:35,920
is so powerful is the comedant of the

3534
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:37,599
weapon school after we did the work. He

3535
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,440
took those words and he put them on the

3536
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:41,040
coin. Oh really? And they exist on the

3537
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:43,920
coin and they have been on there for

3538
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:46,400
years since. And I am so proud to have

3539
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:49,199
given something that has longevity that

3540
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:53,119
is literally on the coin.

3541
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:55,440
Build, teach, lead. Yeah. That is such a

3542
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:57,360
beautiful mantra for life. Yeah. And

3543
02:04:55,440 --> 02:05:00,639
they're they're wonderful people who go

3544
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:03,760
there. And uh what an honor that work

3545
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:06,159
that I did ended up on a coin. And so

3546
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:07,599
they gave me the coin out of gratitude

3547
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:09,520
for the work that I did and it had my

3548
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:11,679
words on it. So it's not my words, it's

3549
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,199
their words. I just helped distill them.

3550
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:15,440
It's who they are when they're at their

3551
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:18,800
natural best. I just helped them put it

3552
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:20,159
and codify it. Simon, thank you. Thanks.

3553
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,960
Always love our conversations and long

3554
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:23,960
may they continue. Likewise.

3555
02:05:24,239 --> 02:05:28,480
This has always blown my mind a little

3556
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:30,560
bit. 53% of you that listen to this show
