1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello Friends.  Folks, looks like the US

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,080
is back to its balancing act.  What I mean to say is

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,160
that on the surface America

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,080
keeps saying again and again that India is a very

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
important country for it.  He wants to trade as much as possible.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,559

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,720
India is needed to counter China.

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,039
But on the other hand, if you look at it,

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,279
history has always been that

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,920
America has, somewhere from behind or

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,080
from the front, fully supported Pakistan.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
And the biggest prime example of this,

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,640
especially given the current situation

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,200
between India and Pakistan,

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
Pakistan's Army Chief, Asim Munir, was

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,360
hosted at the White House.  And

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,680
I am sure that India will not like this at all.

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,760
Infact this is

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,160
not about the host.  The way the words have been

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,960
used here.  Honoured to meet him.

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,640
I love him, I love Pakistan.  So

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
you will get to see such things.  So there

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
is a need to understand this in a little detail to know

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,559
what is actually happening.

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
Why is this meeting here so important and

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,239
what could it lead to?  Let's get started.

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,480
Look, first of all, what I was

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,879
telling you happened just yesterday.  Was

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,040
invited to lunch at the White House.  In

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,600
a way, the Pakistan Army

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,680
Chief General Asim Munir was hosted, who has recently been

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,720
given the title of Field Marshal in Pakistan

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,760
and here Trump

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,240

35
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,320

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,000
presses the role that Munir played in stopping the India-Pakistan escalation that was taking place.  In fact, let

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,960
me first tell you about Trump's statement.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,439
Trump said, I am honoured to meet

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,880
him and apart from that he also

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,520
thanked Munir for

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,320
not going into the war and ending the war,

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,880
meaning Pakistan did not go completely into the war

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,720
and stopped the war, in a way

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,119
he was thanking him for that.  In fact, if you

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,280
see, he said this because many questions were being

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,280
raised that

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
what was the need to invite the Army Chief of Pakistan?  So

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,240
when these questions were being raised he said because I had him here was

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
I wanted to

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,799
thank him for not going into the war and

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,640
ending it.  So this becomes most important.  Not

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,360
only this, he

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,520
also said that Munir is a very smart man.

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
He also told former Prime Minister Modi

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,680
that both of them are very smart persons

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,319
that they did not enter the war.  Otherwise

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,239
both are nuclear powers.  And because of this,

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,879
somewhere he chose the piece which

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,680
I appreciated it.  So this is the thing.

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,000
Well here another theory is coming out that the

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,160

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,480
biggest reason behind calling Asim Munir could be that as

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,480
you all know, there is a

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,640
war going on between Iran and Israel.  There is a full-blown war going on

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,800
and the US can enter it anytime,

66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,800
completely in the front because from behind

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,560
it is helping Israel.  But the

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,640
important thing here is that this

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
border which you are seeing has

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
become Balochistan and here is Iran.  So this

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,560
border is adjacent to Pakistan and see,

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,319
this has always been the problem.  The

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,319
geography of Pakistan becomes so important not

74
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,560
just for this entire region but for the

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,319
whole world, due to this

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
Pakistan is highlighted again and again

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,480
because of its geographical

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,480
location here, especially the

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
BRI that has been constructed with China.  Then

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Afghanistan happened here.  So, this whole region has been experiencing

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,040
a lot of instability here.

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
And that is why America

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,200
needs Pakistan again and again.  So

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,599
because of this, if you see, it seems again that because of the

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,760
Iran war which is going on,

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
Pakistan may be needed here in Iran-Israel as well.  It is

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,920
possible that some

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840

89
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,239
attempt may be made to carry out an attack from Pakistani soil.  Meaning

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,239
help should be taken from here.  Alldo Pakistan has fully

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,720
supported Iran.  But you never know

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,040
what might be going on behind the scenes through the back channel

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,920
?  Will America take help from Pakistan to

94
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,599
carry out some attack

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
inside Iran?  So that will be something to see.

96
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,519
But again there is a lot of discussion going on about it

97
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,360
because keep in mind that yesterday's meeting was a

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,879
closed door meeting

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
because what happens normally is that suppose

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,280
PM Modi goes to the White House, there is a discussion, then

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,040
both of them also talk to the journalists,

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
everything happens but here

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,200
you will not get to see the truth, so the

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,360
question is why did this meeting

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
take place, so one reason behind it, I

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
told you the Iran angle, but at the same time

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Trump has said that

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,840
he publicly claimed, Trump

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,040
publicly claimed and tried to take the credit

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,519
that informal talks were held

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,159
between India and Pakistan so that a ceasefire could be implemented.

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,480
Aldo, you all must be aware that yesterday it was

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,360
clearly said from the Indian side, again in

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,920
fact there was a conversation with Trump on phone for about 35 minutes

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,840
when PM Modi was

116
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,000
in Canada and there also PM Modi

117
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,240
clearly told Trump that look, the

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,919
question of any mediation does

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,440
not arise here.  We haven't done it before either.   I have

120
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,080
n't done it yet and I won't do it in the future either.

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,919
Because it is a simple thing, the Shimla

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,240
Agreement of 1971.  The Shimla Agreement clearly states

123
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,919
that there is no question of involvement of any third party in the India-Pakistan matters.

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840

125
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,560
So what happened here is that

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,639
PM Modi said this and after this,

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,880
if you look again, Trump has

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,360
again repeated his claim that

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,199
he has in a way stopped the India-Pakistan war.

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
If you look again, these

131
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
statements become very important.

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,919
He said, I stopped a war between

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,919
Pakistan and India.  I love Pakistan.

134
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,960
Trump told the reporters here

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,960
outside the White House that Modi is

136
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,800
a fantastic man, I spoke to him last

137
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,560
night and he also said that very

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,720
soon we are going to trade with the Modi of

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,479
India but I stopped a war between

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
Pakistan and India and apart from this

141
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,199
he said this man, meaning he was referring to Asim Munir, he was

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,840
extremely

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,440
influencing in stopping a war.

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,240
Asim Munir has played a very important role

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,560
that from Pakistan's side the war should be

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
stopped and from the other side PM

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Modi stopped the war here.  So they were

148
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,840
going at it.  Both are nuclear countries.

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
I stopped the war.  Again

150
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,880
see here, Trump is saying that I

151
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,960
stopped the war but in my president, I mean he is

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,039
trying to show that look, you should be very

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
happy.  I should be praised and

154
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
many articles should be written about me.

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,680
But you did not write a single article.

156
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
This is PM Modi who is Donald Trump,

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,759
he told the journalists.  Well,

158
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,919
now the question here is why is this meeting

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,160
so important?  Why is

160
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,400
this meeting so significant?  The most

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,560
important thing here is that if you

162
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,520
look at it historically, it is very unusual for the

163
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Pakistani Military Chief to be directly

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,880
invited to the White House.  Especially in an

165
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
official public facing capacity.  Look

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
whose government is in Pakistan?  At present

167
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
Shahbaz Sharif is the Prime Minister.  So

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,520
normally if there were any government to government

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
talks, Shahbaz Sharif would have

170
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,479
gone here and talks would have been held with him, that would have been a different matter.

171
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,280
But you are calling an Army Chief

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,360
and especially here the Indian angle comes into play.

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,199
So because of this many doubts

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
arise.  So, somewhere here it is

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
very unusual and historic that a

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,759
Pakistani Army Chief is being invited to the White House.  Being

177
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,680
called for lunch.

178
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,080
And because of this,

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,319
if you look at the Pakistan angle, Asim Munir is

180
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
continuously raising his diplomatic profile.

181
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,720
Because right now he is not

182
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,960
just a military chief.  He is showing as if he is the

183
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,280
most powerful decision

184
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,319
maker of Pakistan at this time and you never know as

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,400
things are coming to light that there is

186
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
talk of a coup, what will happen is all a matter of the future, the

187
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,360
last time in Pakistan, whenever

188
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,280
someone took the title of Field Marshal, there was a

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,680
coup.

190
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,319
Time will tell if this will happen.  But here it is clearly visible

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,400
that

192
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,000
Asim Munir is bypassing the civilian channels and is

193
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,160
directly interfering in foreign

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,080
policy and military cooperation.  And

195
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,800
what is its strategic objective?

196
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
Asim Munir is in a way trying to achieve many goals.

197
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,199
The first is to

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,599

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,520
rebuild the defense and diplomatic ties with the US.

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,599
Bringing investment.  Look, Pakistan is in big trouble right now.

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,120
Again FATF meeting is going to happen

202
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,560
very soon.  Now we have to see whether it is

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
put in the grey list or not.  India

204
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
will try its best.  But here we are

205
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,280
trying to make America

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,680
invest rapidly

207
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,000
in Pakistan so that some money comes to Pakistan so that

208
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,919
it can improve its condition.  On the other hand,

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,680
as far as India's response is concerned, look, from India's

210
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,039
side I have already told you that

211
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,440
here we have said that there is

212
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,199
no question of third party involvement.  But India will

213
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,039
somehow look at this

214
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
meeting with Asim Munir

215
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,800
with suspicion and somewhere it

216
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
provides legitimacy

217
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,360
to the Pakistan military that it is shaping the global narratives.

218
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,599
So if you see, the Indian Government has

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,080

220
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,319
not used any harsh words regarding this meeting.

221
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,400
But you will see one thing very crystal clear

222
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,800
when PM Modi

223
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,879
went to Canada for the G7 meeting.  If you see

224
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,520
what PM Modi has said in it,

225
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,280

226
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,199
you will see that it was directly said against Trump and against America.   Let

227
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,840
me tell you.  He said PM Modi

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
mentioned terrorism during the G7 meeting.

229
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,160
And look what he said.

230
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,639
Terrorism is the enemy of humanity.  It

231
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,360
stands in opposition to all nations that

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,000
uphold democratic values.  Unity in the

233
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,399
fight against terrorism is imperative.

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,399
If we have to fight terrorism,

235
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,959
we will have to come together.  Well, till here it

236
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,039
is fine.  Then he said unfortunately our own

237
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,880
neighbourhood has become a breeding ground

238
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,640
for terrorism.  So this is a clear indication

239
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,480
towards Pakistan that it has become a huge

240
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,640
breeding ground for terrorism.

241
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,959
For the sake of global peace and

242
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,880
prosperity our thinking and policies

243
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,120
must be extremely clear.  We

244
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,600
must be clear, crystal clear.  That

245
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,959
if any country supports terrorism then

246
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,440
we will have to hold it accountable and that

247
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,680
country will have to pay the price for it.  PM

248
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,720
Modi said this but at the same time he also said

249
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
that the reality is quite different.

250
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,920
PM Modi has directly attacked

251
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,040
Western countries, especially the US.

252
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,080
And it is said that on the one hand you immediately

253
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,680
impose sanctions on those countries based on your

254
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
interest and preference.

255
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,160
You make sensations about anyone.

256
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,240
Be it Iran or your Russia,

257
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,480
any country, you immediately make sensations

258
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,920
according to your interest.  But on the other hand

259
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,240
nations that openly support terrorism

260
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,000
continue to be rewarded.

261
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
For example

262
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Pakistan, you are in a way rewarding those countries which support terrorism.

263
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,000
So you are understanding this

264
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,560
indirectly that Asim Munir's

265
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,720
presence was there, he was invited for lunch at the White House in America, so in

266
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,839
a way,

267
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,320
without even mentioning him,

268
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,000
PM Modi directly attacked America, in a

269
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,080
way you can say.  Well, the

270
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
geopolitical analysis of this is that US-

271
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,000
Pakistan relations may head

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,279
towards a reset from here.  As I was telling you

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
in the beginning, America is

274
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,519
trying to do a balancing act.

275
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,160
Because after 2021, if you see the

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,720
US withdrawal from Afghanistan, it

277
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,720
looked like Pakistan was

278
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,880
completely with the Taliban, which the US did

279
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,920
not like.  The US was concerned.

280
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,000
Now Asim Munir's visit to the White House

281
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,920
signals that there is a reset

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,760
in the relations between America and Pakistan.

283
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,000
Military to military coordination

284
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,079
can increase from here.  On the other hand, Pakistan is still

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
doing its balancing act with China.

286
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,480
So Trump now look at the other side,

287
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,640
what does Trump want?  Trump basically wants to please

288
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,240
his domestic audience by doing all these things.

289
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
Want to show.  To the

290
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,640
domestic audience look at the world

291
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,399
I am a peacemaker.  I

292
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,079
can stop a war even between two nuclear countries.

293
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,560
This is what he is trying to show in a way.

294
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,800
But this will damage the relations between India and US

295
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,640
on a large scale.  No

296
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
doubt, this particular meeting took place, but I

297
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,240

298
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
