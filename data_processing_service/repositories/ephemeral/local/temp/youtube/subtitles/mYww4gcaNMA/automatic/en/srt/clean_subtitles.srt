Hello Friends.  Folks, looks like the US is back to its balancing act.  What I mean to say is that on the surface America keeps saying again and again that India is a very important country for it.  He wants to trade as much as possible. India is needed to counter China. But on the other hand, if you look at it, history has always been that America has, somewhere from behind or from the front, fully supported Pakistan. And the biggest prime example of this, especially given the current situation between India and Pakistan, Pakistan's Army Chief, Asim Munir, was hosted at the White House.  And I am sure that India will not like this at all. Infact this is not about the host.  The way the words have been used here.  Honoured to meet him. I love him, I love Pakistan.  So you will get to see such things.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail to know what is actually happening. Why is this meeting here so important and what could it lead to?  Let's get started. Look, first of all, what I was telling you happened just yesterday.  Was invited to lunch at the White House.  In a way, the Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir was hosted, who has recently been given the title of Field Marshal in Pakistan and here Trump presses the role that Munir played in stopping the India-Pakistan escalation that was taking place.  In fact, let me first tell you about Trump's statement. Trump said, I am honoured to meet him and apart from that he also thanked Munir for not going into the war and ending the war, meaning Pakistan did not go completely into the war and stopped the war, in a way he was thanking him for that.  In fact, if you see, he said this because many questions were being raised that what was the need to invite the Army Chief of Pakistan?  So when these questions were being raised he said because I had him here was I wanted to thank him for not going into the war and ending it.  So this becomes most important.  Not only this, he also said that Munir is a very smart man. He also told former Prime Minister Modi that both of them are very smart persons that they did not enter the war.  Otherwise both are nuclear powers.  And because of this, somewhere he chose the piece which I appreciated it.  So this is the thing. Well here another theory is coming out that the biggest reason behind calling Asim Munir could be that as you all know, there is a war going on between Iran and Israel.  There is a full-blown war going on and the US can enter it anytime, completely in the front because from behind it is helping Israel.  But the important thing here is that this border which you are seeing has become Balochistan and here is Iran.  So this border is adjacent to Pakistan and see, this has always been the problem.  The geography of Pakistan becomes so important not just for this entire region but for the whole world, due to this Pakistan is highlighted again and again because of its geographical location here, especially the BRI that has been constructed with China.  Then Afghanistan happened here.  So, this whole region has been experiencing a lot of instability here. And that is why America needs Pakistan again and again.  So because of this, if you see, it seems again that because of the Iran war which is going on, Pakistan may be needed here in Iran-Israel as well.  It is possible that some attempt may be made to carry out an attack from Pakistani soil.  Meaning help should be taken from here.  Alldo Pakistan has fully supported Iran.  But you never know what might be going on behind the scenes through the back channel ?  Will America take help from Pakistan to carry out some attack inside Iran?  So that will be something to see. But again there is a lot of discussion going on about it because keep in mind that yesterday's meeting was a closed door meeting because what happens normally is that suppose PM Modi goes to the White House, there is a discussion, then both of them also talk to the journalists, everything happens but here you will not get to see the truth, so the question is why did this meeting take place, so one reason behind it, I told you the Iran angle, but at the same time Trump has said that he publicly claimed, Trump publicly claimed and tried to take the credit that informal talks were held between India and Pakistan so that a ceasefire could be implemented. Aldo, you all must be aware that yesterday it was clearly said from the Indian side, again in fact there was a conversation with Trump on phone for about 35 minutes when PM Modi was in Canada and there also PM Modi clearly told Trump that look, the question of any mediation does not arise here.  We haven't done it before either.   I have n't done it yet and I won't do it in the future either. Because it is a simple thing, the Shimla Agreement of 1971.  The Shimla Agreement clearly states that there is no question of involvement of any third party in the India-Pakistan matters. So what happened here is that PM Modi said this and after this, if you look again, Trump has again repeated his claim that he has in a way stopped the India-Pakistan war. If you look again, these statements become very important. He said, I stopped a war between Pakistan and India.  I love Pakistan. Trump told the reporters here outside the White House that Modi is a fantastic man, I spoke to him last night and he also said that very soon we are going to trade with the Modi of India but I stopped a war between Pakistan and India and apart from this he said this man, meaning he was referring to Asim Munir, he was extremely influencing in stopping a war. Asim Munir has played a very important role that from Pakistan's side the war should be stopped and from the other side PM Modi stopped the war here.  So they were going at it.  Both are nuclear countries. I stopped the war.  Again see here, Trump is saying that I stopped the war but in my president, I mean he is trying to show that look, you should be very happy.  I should be praised and many articles should be written about me. But you did not write a single article. This is PM Modi who is Donald Trump, he told the journalists.  Well, now the question here is why is this meeting so important?  Why is this meeting so significant?  The most important thing here is that if you look at it historically, it is very unusual for the Pakistani Military Chief to be directly invited to the White House.  Especially in an official public facing capacity.  Look whose government is in Pakistan?  At present Shahbaz Sharif is the Prime Minister.  So normally if there were any government to government talks, Shahbaz Sharif would have gone here and talks would have been held with him, that would have been a different matter. But you are calling an Army Chief and especially here the Indian angle comes into play. So because of this many doubts arise.  So, somewhere here it is very unusual and historic that a Pakistani Army Chief is being invited to the White House.  Being called for lunch. And because of this, if you look at the Pakistan angle, Asim Munir is continuously raising his diplomatic profile. Because right now he is not just a military chief.  He is showing as if he is the most powerful decision maker of Pakistan at this time and you never know as things are coming to light that there is talk of a coup, what will happen is all a matter of the future, the last time in Pakistan, whenever someone took the title of Field Marshal, there was a coup. Time will tell if this will happen.  But here it is clearly visible that Asim Munir is bypassing the civilian channels and is directly interfering in foreign policy and military cooperation.  And what is its strategic objective? Asim Munir is in a way trying to achieve many goals. The first is to rebuild the defense and diplomatic ties with the US. Bringing investment.  Look, Pakistan is in big trouble right now. Again FATF meeting is going to happen very soon.  Now we have to see whether it is put in the grey list or not.  India will try its best.  But here we are trying to make America invest rapidly in Pakistan so that some money comes to Pakistan so that it can improve its condition.  On the other hand, as far as India's response is concerned, look, from India's side I have already told you that here we have said that there is no question of third party involvement.  But India will somehow look at this meeting with Asim Munir with suspicion and somewhere it provides legitimacy to the Pakistan military that it is shaping the global narratives. So if you see, the Indian Government has not used any harsh words regarding this meeting. But you will see one thing very crystal clear when PM Modi went to Canada for the G7 meeting.  If you see what PM Modi has said in it, you will see that it was directly said against Trump and against America.   Let me tell you.  He said PM Modi mentioned terrorism during the G7 meeting. And look what he said. Terrorism is the enemy of humanity.  It stands in opposition to all nations that uphold democratic values.  Unity in the fight against terrorism is imperative. If we have to fight terrorism, we will have to come together.  Well, till here it is fine.  Then he said unfortunately our own neighbourhood has become a breeding ground for terrorism.  So this is a clear indication towards Pakistan that it has become a huge breeding ground for terrorism. For the sake of global peace and prosperity our thinking and policies must be extremely clear.  We must be clear, crystal clear.  That if any country supports terrorism then we will have to hold it accountable and that country will have to pay the price for it.  PM Modi said this but at the same time he also said that the reality is quite different. PM Modi has directly attacked Western countries, especially the US. And it is said that on the one hand you immediately impose sanctions on those countries based on your interest and preference. You make sensations about anyone. Be it Iran or your Russia, any country, you immediately make sensations according to your interest.  But on the other hand nations that openly support terrorism continue to be rewarded. For example Pakistan, you are in a way rewarding those countries which support terrorism. So you are understanding this indirectly that Asim Munir's presence was there, he was invited for lunch at the White House in America, so in a way, without even mentioning him, PM Modi directly attacked America, in a way you can say.  Well, the geopolitical analysis of this is that US- Pakistan relations may head towards a reset from here.  As I was telling you in the beginning, America is trying to do a balancing act. Because after 2021, if you see the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, it looked like Pakistan was completely with the Taliban, which the US did not like.  The US was concerned. Now Asim Munir's visit to the White House signals that there is a reset in the relations between America and Pakistan. Military to military coordination can increase from here.  On the other hand, Pakistan is still doing its balancing act with China. So Trump now look at the other side, what does Trump want?  Trump basically wants to please his domestic audience by doing all these things. Want to show.  To the domestic audience look at the world I am a peacemaker.  I can stop a war even between two nuclear countries. This is what he is trying to show in a way. But this will damage the relations between India and US on a large scale.  No doubt, this particular meeting took place, but I hope you have understood this video in detail and before leaving, can you tell me a very interesting question, here two statements have been given about US-Pakistan relations, which one is correct, you all know the right answer to it, you will find it on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from Telegram and friends, as you all know, if you want to prepare for UPSC on Study IQ, you can avail our Pratigya batch, GS Foundation Pratigya batch, there are a lot of features in it, if there is any doubt, problem, simply our team is sitting, the phone numbers are given here, call and all your doubts will be resolved.
