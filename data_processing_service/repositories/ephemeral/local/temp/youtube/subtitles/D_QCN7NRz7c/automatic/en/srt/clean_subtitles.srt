I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  India is going to attack Israel, friends. Perhaps you will be surprised to know.  And at the same time Pakistan and China are going to fight each other. Donald Trump will make Iran his 51st state and Donald Trump will also say that now I am retiring so I will come to India and learn Kriya Yoga and I have realized my mistake.  This is what you were thinking and wanted to hear. Yesterday friends, you people had less comments but let me tell you that Sir, tell me something new. What new should I tell you?  Brother, I will tell you only what is happening, whether I should make the news myself or get the attack done myself. Brother, I will tell you whatever is going on. What else should I say?  I work in a small business.  Or maybe I'm some advisor to Ali Khomenei.  I am a little what do you think brother?  I am some RNW agent or someone deep inside the government or the entire media is under my control.  Brother, the news that is coming to me is Indian Express, The Hindu, Times of India, the rest, whatever is my knowledge, whatever is my analysis, I will tell you that only.  So what is repetition in this, look, a lot of you guys, look, you guys love me a lot and I love you more than that. Ok?  You have given me so much love. Now what happens is that those who are already subscribers, but many new people join, so I keep giving them an overview that this is the old news. All these things are old and the good thing is that you also get revised in them. You remember all the things.  So, I will tell you this much, brother, I will tell you whatever it is.  I cannot create anything new in this. Ok?  All this news was fake. None of this is true.  Right now we will talk about A Five Ways.  See, Iran-Israel war is going on and there are five possibilities of what can happen next, now you can see this, right brother, the map is the best for me, if I think it is very good to explain through a map, then you see this, ah ha ha ha what a thing, Iran, this son Tairan, right, it is about 100 km away from this, Fado, this Svahan, their nuclear site is right here and this is all a hilly area, this area is a hilly area, right? Anyway, which place is there in Iran in the whole of Iran?  I forgot the name.  The temperature there goes up to 60 degrees Celsius.  It is the hottest place in the world.  Ok? And you will also find mountains here.  Ok ?  And these entire mountain ranges cover Iraq and Syria.  Iran has also built its own proper corridor till here. Ok?  A proper corridor has been built. Now this is not what the corridor means.  When Israel says that we can attack on the ground, then brother, there can be an attack on the ground because America has also built bases there.   Is it okay?  America has bases in all these places. America has bases in the Gulf. America is everywhere, son, there is police who keeps an eye on everywhere.  Look at his strength, son.  It is a dangerous country.  Dangerous.  Ok?  And look at Iran too, many support groups of Iran are spread here. So this is what is called geopolitics.  Now if someone is choked the most, then assume that the condition of this region is bad.  I mean, here in Turkey, brother, is comfortably consuming cheap drugs and supporting Pakistan.  Here Armenia has joined hands with India.   Did you see that cypress?  Is it okay?  So it would be fun if India forms a Mediterranean Alliance with Cyprus, Armenia, Greece and Israel.  In my opinion, Narendra Modi should not delay this any further. This will become more important than the most important Quad.  Is it okay?  To show everyone their place.  But now let us see whether this will happen or not.  But this is the situation right now.  Ok?  This is turkey.  This says that we are leaders.  Saudi Arabia is done.  This says we are the leaders of the Islamic world. Iran says we are Islamic.  There is chaos in these three countries. Now Turkey is supporting terrorism all over the world, it is supporting Hamas.  He is supporting Pakistan. Hamas comes to Pakistan.  Turkey says take it son drone.  Attack wherever necessary in Palgaon attack.  So, India is observing all this, how this geopolitics is impacting, how its effect is being felt on India. Right?  So right now the Iran Israel war has spoiled the whole game.  Ok? This entire region will continue to be destabilized by this war. Till that dialogue is there that bhaiya as long as there is cinema in India people will keep on becoming fools. So it stays like that until whatever is there, it remains there. Isn't it?  And there is greed in the human mind.  Even after having so much he is still not satisfied. Until then this will keep happening.  And America brother has become capitalization.  Ok?  Iran has become fanaticism, both are complete opposites.  Now there is no aspect attractor here.  There are odd fights happening here.  Is it okay?  That we will control you.  You will control us.  America's entire brother look iran overnight you're working very hard in one place. You grew that tree.  Ok ?  Suppose, let us understand with the example of a tree, that you grew a tree.  A very nice big tree grew.  Now it will bear fruit.   It is bearing fruit.  But one day, the very next day, when you come, that tree is occupied by someone else and he doesn't let you come.  The mood will not be spoiled.  So America is in a bad mood because brother, we formed an oil company here.  Then say, Britain, Russia, America and our patience, energy and how did this revolution come in 1979?  How can it happen?   It's a matter of ego.  So that is why for Iran and Israel, brother, for the last 2000 years, from Crusade till now, for Iran and Israel, it is a matter of life and death.  Is it okay?  So this is all happening. Currently, in public speaking, whether it is Homeni Sahab or Donald Trump Sahab, both are amazing public speakers.  So if you want to learn Public Speaking, NLP, EFT, Audience Analysis, Personal Branding, Body Language, Story Language, Group Discussion etc. then this is our recorded course for only ₹400.  Psychologist Dr. Mayurika Das has created it.  You can avail the course.  You will benefit a lot. So look, I have explained all this to you.  Is it okay?  There has been a strike at the hospital.  There has been a strike on this. So now, we will not go into this.  It is important that the thing about which the fight is going on is a nuclear bomb.  Hey, the IAEA chief said that there is no nuclear bomb.  where where?  We never even said that there is a nuclear bomb.  It's amazing.  So now let's look at five possibilities.  I have already explained all this in previous lectures. What is a bunker buster bomb? What can everything happen? So the first thing is America's involvement and then regional escalation. If America gets involved and China gets involved, then friends the world can move towards World War 3.  You will say Sir World War 3, you have been saying this for two years brother I am not saying anything friend, whatever things are happening World War 3 is already going on.   The whole world is involved in war at this time. India and Pakistan were left and they also got involved.  Is it okay?  So almost every country is at war in some way. So America has said that it will not attack but Donald Trump has approved it, from the steps that are being taken it is clear that if not today then tomorrow America will attack very soon, now suppose any bomb falls on an American, which is going to fall very soon, then Donald Trump will immediately give the military order to attack.  Ok?  Now, Iran has proxies in Lebanon and Yemen, and Yemen is in the Gulf due to which it is above everyone, here the State of Foremost Balal Mandeb, and Hezbollah, are on the Lebanon side, so it is obvious that this is the climax and Iran will say kill us because we have to die anyway, so we will drown, my love, and will take you along with us, so we will kill and die. Okay, the American bases that it has built in Iraq, 40 to 43000 troops, America is currently spread across the entire Gulf region, so Iraq can attack there as well, so one possibility is that America gets directly involved, but either Iran attacks in it.  Well why isn't America attacking? America is in crisis right now.  Everything is done.  Everything was also signed.  Even if Donald Trump approves it, America is still saying that no, we will not go ahead and attack.  The reason for this, friends, is that Iran has not yet touched America. And if that is what you are saying about Iran, look at when America jumped into the war. America needs a reason.  Ok? What is that reason?  When the attack happened in 1917.  Ok ?  America is accused of having itself attacked American ships so that it could jump into the war.  Then after that, the Pearl Harbor incident happened in 1940. Unless you are attacked.   In 1991, there was an attack on America, then America entered.  Till then how can you invade any country ?  How can you attack?  So Iran has not yet attacked America and Israel is saying that you will have to come with us brother, you are my younger brother, my younger brother is calling you, where are you, I am searching for you here, where are you, so that is why Israel is saying that you will have to come brother, so America is saying that friend it will be a big problem, Don Trump is saying that friend what should we do, what should we think, but saliva is dripping from Don Trump's tongue because he wants war and he will stop it and after that he has planned an entry like a hero, a completely KGF style entry.   Will play background music in the background.  So should Donald Trump.  Well now Donald Trump came to power.  Why?  They will say we don't want war.  But look at that goddamn Trump, he keeps on talking all this nonsense. They want this heroic welcome.  Brother, once we come to power, we will remain here for four years.  Now mid term elections are to be held next year.  But the war is still going on. Right now, no one will be able to do anything to Donald Trump.   There were riots in Los Angeles. Taken off by the Marines.  Did someone uproot it? Nothing can uproot it.  So Don Trump is completely satisfied at this point in time.  And but the thing is that if they jump then they are sure to lose.  Anyway, his defeat is certain.  Everyone from Elon Musk to Tucker Kasson to Steve Banner has thrown their hat in the towel.  Those who used to support him a lot have become his rivals today.  Are you understanding what I am saying?  So the longer this war continues, the possibility of a full-scale regional war will increase.  And this war will stop only when America comes.  If America comes, my America will come.  So this war will stop only when America comes, within a week or a week and a half. Because brother what is your main motive?   They tell Khomeini that we will kill him.  We know your location and we have to destroy the nuclear program. So you have the bomb.  You can do it. So let's fight.  Then this is the thing.  And if this happens then Iran will obviously surrender.  Ok?  And then there might be a civil war in Iran.  Because if you prolong the war then there will be a possibility of civil war in Iran. Second what happens is second possibility. After that, what follows is Gulf Brother sandwiched in the middle. Here is Israel, there is Iran and in the middle is the Gulf like a sandwich.   If a missile misfires somewhere, it will fall directly in Saudi Arabia or UAE.  And you know that Iran first destroyed Iran's oil field on top of each other and Iran destroyed the oil field there.  Ok? Israel's oil field in Haifa was hit.  So if Iran is unable to harm Israel directly, it may be able to harm the Gulf States.  The love of UAE and Saudi Arabia for Israel is well known.  This is very strange to me. Let me tell you one thing, like it happens a lot that people boycott.  Ok? Boycott Israel.  So I will not drink Coca Cola. Iran says they will not drink it. Iran says we will not do that.  We, Israel, have been created by the Jews. what are you talking about my brother? Who created Facebook?  Mark Zuckerberg is a Jew. Who created YouTube?  Who created Google? All Jews made me brothers.  Whatever you talk about about Windows technology, the computer on which you sit and work in Iran , that too was made by a Jew. Jews have a lot of power.  They are very intellectuals.  They are told from childhood, son, you have to become a genius.  You have no other choice. All Nobel Prize winners are Jews. Who is Albert Einstein ?  Who is Steven Speidelberg?  So brother, you cannot boycott Jewish products in today's time.  This is the truth. Ok?  What now?  Well, this was a fun fact.  It was a fact.  What is the fun fact?  So if Iran attacks the Gulf States then what will you say after that?  Come to America. Maybe then America will get involved.  Is n't it?  Let the military intervene.  America is waiting for time.  Why doesn't Donald Trump just say no ?  Iran attack.  He is just saying hurry up friend.  I think I should say no to it myself.  I should have turned on the phone and told him, " Brother, attack fast, I am getting tired."  The third one is in the nuclear program main, so this is the one which for the facility is their most dangerous, it is being said to be 800 meters, friends, we cannot say it is 800 meters, some say it is 300 meters, some say it is 500 meters, we do not have much detail about it, so we can tell it is 800 meters, so their GBU 57 bomb is the only one that can hit, it first goes and drills and then explodes, GPS VPS is installed and this 52 bomber is their very powerful plane, just like a spaceship, it is used very rarely by America. So Iran can accelerate its nuclear program. Suppose it is not destroyed, then that is your entire AI and it has also said that Iran has had enough of its stuff and we are withdrawing from the NPT.  We do n't want NPT.  Fourth brother, the entire world can go on the verge of destruction because all the energy is controlled from here.  The oil prices have gone up a lot and if this continues for a month and a half, then friends, the petrol which is available in India for ₹100, can go up to 150 and then the inflation will also reach its peak because Iran is saying that we will attack the Red Sea. They have attacked the Red Sea before as well but there is also a misunderstanding that we will not attack here.  Because then it will be the same thing that you will have to face the anger of America and the State of Hormone forces will block you. 20% of the energy goes from here only.  So an energy crisis can be created due to which the whole world can put pressure to stop the war. Iran can use this good strategy.  After that, inflation can increase tremendously.  And what did Russia do after that? This is what he had said, look, Russia will benefit a lot from this.  How will it benefit? If Iran disrupts the energy, then Russia has oil.  Russia has energy.  Russia will say that now remove the sanctions from us because when Iran is not able to supply, we will supply. We have stock.  If India buys oil then Russia will benefit a lot. After that the final Iranian government collapse regime change may occur. And here Benjamin leader Yahoo is continuously saying the same thing to Iran.  Change the regime brother, change the regime.  He is repeatedly saying that the name Operation Rising Lion has been kept for this very purpose.  Ok?  That people should rise like lions and change the regime.  So this is the main plan of America and Israel.  But friends, this seems very difficult. Maybe if America jumps in.  The sudden collapse will be like post-war Iraq.  Just like America entered Libya because they had weapons. Nothing was found.  That is why I entered Iraq also. Saddam Hussein was hanged.  But even today Iran is unstable.  A similar situation may arise in Iran.  But this will give people happy freedom from extremism. When America goes to the place where there is fundamentalism and the condition of women, then see that there is one good thing about America.  This thing is a million things bad.  But one thing is right that America opens up the economy and America gives freedom to the people.  Like in Afghanistan, America tried hard to have a democratic election.  Schools should be built, women should go there, they should study and those who are there actively should run the government.  America does this. So this benefit can be availed by the people because somewhere people's anger is suppressed in Iran.  After that, civilian casualties are occurring. But it is happening in Israel too. A hospital in Israel was also attacked.  So far, friends, many people have been killed.  Nearly 600 people were killed including 70 women and children and see the unofficial figure would be quite high. So now here it may happen that if there is a civilian casualty and Israel kills, which it is doing, then the public may organize a rally in support of Iran. However, the biggest thing is that there is no organised opposition. So when there is no organised opposition then how can you work? This is the accounting.  There are no forms for third parties. Europe is already marginalized.  Is it okay?  America, this is only America, Israel and no one else.  No one from India can enter into it.  Now however here Iran is saying that we are talking to America. Some Geneva efforts are also being made to revive the negotiations. Everything is happening.  But for now friends, let us assume that the end is that only one person will win here.  We'll see what happens going forward. Apart from this, you must avail our courses.  The link to the public speaking course description is given in the comment box. Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant Agnihotri signing off.
