1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,400
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,160
Welcome to Study Gloss.  India is going to

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,920
attack Israel, friends.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,080
Perhaps you will be surprised to know.  And at the same

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,119
time Pakistan and China are going to fight each other.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,359
Donald Trump will make Iran his 51st

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,039
state and Donald Trump will also

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,600
say that now I am retiring so

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480
I will come to India and learn Kriya Yoga and I have

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,800
realized my mistake.  This is what

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,719
you were thinking and wanted to hear.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,480
Yesterday friends, you people had less comments

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
but let me tell you that Sir, tell me something new.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
What new should I tell you?  Brother, I will

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,280
tell you only what is happening, whether I should

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,840
make the news myself or get the attack done myself.

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,000
Brother, I will tell you whatever is going on.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,039
What else should I say?  I

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,320
work in a small business.  Or maybe

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,399
I'm some advisor to Ali Khomenei.  I am a little

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,399
what do you think brother?  I

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,640
am some RNW agent or someone deep

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
inside the government or the entire

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,040
media is under my control.  Brother, the

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,360
news that is coming to me is Indian Express, The

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,439
Hindu, Times of India, the rest, whatever is my

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,080
knowledge, whatever is my analysis, I will

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,000
tell you that only.  So what is repetition in this, look,

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
a lot of you guys, look, you guys love me a lot

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,600
and I love you more than that.

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,759
Ok?  You have given me so much love.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
Now what happens is that those who are already

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,479
subscribers, but many

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,320
new people join, so I keep giving them an overview

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,200
that this is the old news.

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,200
All these things are old and the good thing is that

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
you also get revised in them.

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
You remember all the things.  So,

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,159
I will tell you this much, brother,

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,479
I will tell you whatever it is.  I cannot create anything new in this.

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,880
Ok?  All this news was fake.

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,799
None of this is true.  Right now we

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,040
will talk about A Five Ways.  See, Iran-Israel

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,759
war is going on and there are five possibilities of what can happen next,

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,320
now you can see this,

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,240
right brother, the map is the

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
best for me, if I think it is

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,920
very good to explain through a map, then you

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,360
see this, ah ha ha ha what a thing, Iran, this

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,200
son Tairan, right, it is about 100 km

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,120
away from this, Fado, this Svahan,

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,280
their nuclear site is right here and this is all a hilly

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,520
area, this area is a hilly area,

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
right? Anyway,

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,800
which place is there in Iran in the whole of Iran?  I forgot the name.  The

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
temperature there goes up to 60 degrees Celsius.  It

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,040
is the hottest place in the world.  Ok?

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,400
And you will also find mountains here.  Ok

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
?  And these entire mountain ranges

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
cover Iraq and Syria.  Iran has

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
also built its own proper corridor till here.

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,280
Ok?  A proper corridor has been built.

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,920
Now this is not what the corridor means.  When

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Israel says that we can attack on the ground, then

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,800
brother, there can be an attack on the ground

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
because America has also built bases there.   Is it

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,959
okay?  America has bases in all these places.

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,680
America has bases in the Gulf.

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,760
America is everywhere, son, there is police who

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,080
keeps an eye on everywhere.  Look at his strength, son.  It

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,280
is a dangerous country.  Dangerous.  Ok?  And

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
look at Iran too, many

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,560
support groups of Iran are spread here.

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,959
So this is what is

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,840
called geopolitics.  Now if someone is

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,840
choked the most, then assume that the

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
condition of this region is bad.  I mean, here in Turkey,

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
brother, is comfortably consuming cheap drugs and

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
supporting Pakistan.  Here

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,120
Armenia has joined hands with India.   Did

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,319
you see that cypress?  Is it okay?  So it would be

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,040

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,879

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,720
fun if India forms a Mediterranean Alliance with Cyprus, Armenia, Greece and Israel.  In my opinion,

86
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,959
Narendra Modi should not delay this any further.

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,959

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,280
This will become more important than the most important Quad.  Is it okay?  To

89
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,680
show everyone their place.  But now let us see whether

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,080
this will happen or not.  But this

91
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,239
is the situation right now.  Ok?  This is turkey.  This says

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
that we are leaders.  Saudi Arabia is done.  This

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
says we are the leaders of the Islamic world.

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,480
Iran says we are Islamic.  There is chaos in these three countries.

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,640
Now Turkey is supporting

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,319
terrorism all over the world, it is

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,239
supporting Hamas.  He is supporting Pakistan.

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,239
Hamas comes to Pakistan.  Turkey

99
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,680
says take it son drone.  Attack

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,480
wherever necessary in Palgaon attack.  So,

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,959
India is observing all this,

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,760
how this geopolitics is impacting,

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,200
how its effect is being felt on India.

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,519
Right?  So right now the Iran Israel

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,400
war has spoiled the whole game.  Ok?

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,120
This entire region will continue to be destabilized by this war.

107
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,520
Till that dialogue is there that bhaiya

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,240
as long as there is cinema in India people will keep on becoming fools.

109
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,800
So it stays like that until whatever is there, it remains there.

110
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,199
Isn't it?  And there is greed in the human mind.  Even after having so

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,919
much he is still not satisfied.

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,040
Until then this will keep happening.  And America

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,320
brother has become capitalization.  Ok?  Iran has

114
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,479
become fanaticism, both are complete opposites.  Now there

115
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,040
is no aspect attractor here.  There

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
are odd fights happening here.  Is it okay?  That

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
we will control you.  You will

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
control us.  America's entire brother

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
look iran overnight you're working very hard in one place.

120
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
You grew that tree.  Ok

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,960
?  Suppose, let us understand with the example of a tree, that

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
you grew a tree.  A very

123
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,919
nice big tree grew.  Now it will bear fruit.   It

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
is bearing fruit.  But one day, the very next

125
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,759
day, when you come, that tree is

126
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,440
occupied by someone else and he doesn't let you come.  The mood will

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,759
not be spoiled.  So America is in a

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,160
bad mood because brother, we

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,680
formed an oil company here.  Then say, Britain, Russia,

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,320
America and our patience, energy and

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,560
how did this revolution come in 1979?  How can it happen?   It's a

132
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,720
matter of ego.  So that is why

133
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
for Iran and Israel, brother, for the last

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,840
2000 years, from Crusade till now, for

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,440
Iran and Israel, it is a matter of life and death.  Is it

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,600
okay?  So this is all happening.

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,320
Currently, in public speaking, whether it is Homeni Sahab or

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,160
Donald Trump Sahab, both are

139
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,919
amazing public speakers.  So if

140
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
you want to learn Public Speaking, NLP, EFT, Audience

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,000
Analysis, Personal Branding, Body Language,

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Story Language, Group Discussion etc. then

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
this is our recorded

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
course for only ₹400.  Psychologist

145
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
Dr. Mayurika Das has created it.  You can

146
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
avail the course.  You will benefit a lot.

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,039
So look, I have explained all this to you.  Is it

148
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,880
okay?  There has

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,199
been a strike at the hospital.  There has been a strike on this.

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
So now, we will not go into this.  It is

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
important that the thing about which the fight is

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,600
going on is a nuclear

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,440
bomb.  Hey, the IAEA chief said that there

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
is no nuclear bomb.  where where?  We never even

155
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,720
said that there is a nuclear bomb.  It's

156
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,560
amazing.  So now let's

157
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
look at five possibilities.  I have already explained all this

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
in previous lectures. What is a bunker buster

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,600
bomb? What can everything happen?

160
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,759
So the first thing is

161
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
America's involvement and then regional

162
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,160
escalation. If America gets involved and

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,560
China gets involved, then friends the world can

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,800
move towards World War 3.  You will

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,680
say Sir World War 3, you have been saying this for two years

166
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,759
brother I am not saying anything friend, whatever things are

167
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,280
happening World War 3 is already going on.   The

168
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,639
whole world is involved in war at this time.

169
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,440
India and Pakistan were left and they also got

170
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,759
involved.  Is it okay?  So almost every country is at

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,759
war in some way.

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,919
So America has said that it will not

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,639
attack but Donald Trump has

174
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,880
approved it, from the steps that are being taken it is

175
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,160
clear that if not today then tomorrow

176
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,400
America will attack very soon, now suppose

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,639
any bomb falls on an American, which is going to

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
fall very soon, then Donald Trump will

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,680
immediately

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,639
give the military order to attack.  Ok?  Now,

181
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,880
Iran has proxies in Lebanon and Yemen,

182
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,759
and Yemen is in the Gulf due to which it is

183
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,479
above everyone, here the State of Foremost Balal Mandeb, and

184
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,240
Hezbollah, are on the Lebanon side, so it is

185
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,319
obvious that this is the climax and Iran

186
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,120
will say kill us because we have to die anyway, so

187
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,919
we will drown, my love, and will take you along with us, so we will

188
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,319
kill and die. Okay, the American bases that

189
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,560
it has built in Iraq, 40 to 43000

190
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,120
troops, America is currently spread across the entire Gulf region, so

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
Iraq can attack there as well, so

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
one possibility is that

193
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,520
America gets directly involved, but

194
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,759
either Iran attacks in it.  Well

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,720
why isn't America attacking?

196
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,280
America is in crisis right now.  Everything is

197
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
done.  Everything was also signed.  Even if Donald

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,800
Trump approves it,

199
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
America is still saying that no, we will not go ahead and attack.  The

200
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
reason for this, friends, is that

201
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,919
Iran has not yet touched America.

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,240
And if that is what you are saying about Iran,

203
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,720
look at when America jumped into the war.

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,840
America needs a reason.  Ok?

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,160
What is that reason?  When the attack happened in 1917.  Ok

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,080
?  America is accused of having

207
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,639
itself attacked American ships

208
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,120
so that it could jump into the war.  Then

209
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,919
after that, the Pearl Harbor incident happened in 1940.

210
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,000
Unless you are attacked.   In

211
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,960
1991, there was an attack on America, then America

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,639
entered.  Till then how can you invade any country

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,639
?  How can you attack?  So

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,039
Iran has not yet attacked America

215
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,399
and Israel is saying that you will have to

216
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,599
come with us brother, you are my younger brother, my

217
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,760
younger brother is calling you, where are

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,920
you, I am searching for you here, where are you,

219
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,640
so that is why Israel is saying that you will have to come

220
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,480
brother, so America is saying that friend it will be a

221
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
big problem, Don Trump is saying that

222
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
friend what should we do, what should we think, but

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
saliva is dripping from Don Trump's tongue

224
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,959
because he wants war and he will

225
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
stop it and after that he has planned an entry like a hero, a

226
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,640
completely KGF

227
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,040
style entry.   Will

228
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
play background music in the background.  So

229
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,399
should Donald Trump.  Well now Donald

230
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,640
Trump came to power.  Why?  They will say

231
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,880
we don't want war.  But look at that

232
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,440
goddamn Trump, he keeps on talking all this nonsense.

233
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,680
They want this heroic

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,360
welcome.  Brother, once we come to power,

235
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,720
we will remain here for four years.  Now mid term

236
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,399
elections are to be held next year.  But the war is still going on.

237
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,080
Right now, no

238
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,480
one will be able to do anything to Donald Trump.   There were

239
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,839
riots in Los Angeles.

240
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
Taken off by the Marines.  Did someone uproot it?

241
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,519
Nothing can uproot it.  So Don Trump is

242
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,279
completely satisfied at this point in time.  And

243
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
but the thing is that if they jump

244
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,040
then they are sure to lose.  Anyway, his defeat is

245
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,839
certain.  Everyone from Elon Musk to Tucker Kasson to

246
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,240
Steve Banner has thrown their hat in the towel.  Those who used to

247
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,240
support him a lot have

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,399
become his rivals today.  Are you understanding what

249
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,120
I am saying?  So the longer this war continues, the

250
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,360
possibility of a full-scale regional war will

251
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,560
increase.  And this war will stop only when

252
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,880
America comes.  If America comes, my

253
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,040
America will come.  So this war will stop only when America comes,

254
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,160
within a week or a week and a half.

255
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,240
Because brother what is your main motive?   They

256
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,320
tell Khomeini that we will

257
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
kill him.  We know your location and

258
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,920
we have to destroy the nuclear program.

259
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
So you have the bomb.  You can do it.

260
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,160
So let's fight.  Then this is the thing.  And

261
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,040
if this happens then Iran will obviously

262
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,399
surrender.  Ok?  And then there might be a

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,079
civil war in Iran.  Because

264
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,920
if you prolong the war then there will be a possibility of civil war

265
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,640
in Iran.

266
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,640
Second what happens is second possibility.

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
After that, what follows is Gulf Brother sandwiched in the middle.

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,240
Here is Israel, there is Iran and

269
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,560
in the middle is the Gulf like a sandwich.   If

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,800
a missile misfires somewhere, it will

271
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,959
fall directly in Saudi Arabia or UAE.  And

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,360
you know that Iran

273
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,040
first destroyed Iran's oil field on top of each other and Iran

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,600
destroyed the oil field there.  Ok?

275
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,000
Israel's oil field in Haifa was hit.  So

276
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,160
if Iran is

277
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,160
unable to harm Israel directly, it

278
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,320
may be able to harm the Gulf States.  The

279
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,000
love of UAE and Saudi Arabia for

280
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,160
Israel is well known.  This is very strange to me. Let

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
me tell you one thing, like it

282
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,399
happens a lot that people boycott.  Ok?

283
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
Boycott Israel.  So I will not drink Coca Cola.

284
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,720
Iran says they will not drink it.

285
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,880
Iran says we will not do that.  We,

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Israel, have been created by the Jews.

287
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,440
what are you talking about my brother?

288
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,120
Who created Facebook?  Mark Zuckerberg is a Jew.

289
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
Who created YouTube?  Who created Google?

290
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
All Jews made me brothers.  Whatever you

291
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,600
talk about about Windows technology, the

292
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
computer on which you sit and work in Iran

293
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,480
, that too was made by a Jew.

294
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,240
Jews have a lot of power.  They are very

295
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,079
intellectuals.  They are told from childhood,

296
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,160
son, you have to become a genius.  You

297
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,600
have no other choice.

298
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,959
All Nobel Prize winners are Jews. Who is Albert Einstein

299
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,680
?  Who is Steven Speidelberg?  So brother, you

300
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,440

301
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,079
cannot boycott Jewish products in today's time.  This is the truth.

302
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,720
Ok?  What now?  Well, this was a fun

303
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,680
fact.  It was a fact.  What is the fun fact?  So

304
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,040
if Iran attacks the Gulf States then

305
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,959
what will you say after that?  Come to America.

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,120
Maybe then America will get involved.  Is

307
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,600
n't it?  Let the military intervene.  America

308
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,440
is waiting for time.  Why doesn't Donald Trump just say no

309
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,279
?  Iran attack.  He is just saying

310
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,200
hurry up friend.  I think I should say

311
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,200
no to it myself.  I should have turned on the phone and told him, "

312
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,560
Brother, attack fast, I am getting tired."  The

313
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,920
third one is in the nuclear

314
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,959
program main, so this is the one which for the

315
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,800
facility is their most dangerous, it is being said to be 800 meters,

316
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,959
friends, we cannot say it is 800 meters,

317
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,720
some say it is 300 meters,

318
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,880
some say it is 500 meters, we do not have much detail about it, so we can

319
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,600
tell it is 800 meters, so

320
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,160
their GBU 57 bomb is the only one that

321
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,639
can hit, it first goes and

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,760
drills and then explodes, GPS VPS is

323
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,760
installed and this 52 bomber is their

324
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,839
very powerful plane, just like a spaceship,

325
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,240
it is used very rarely by America.

326
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,560
So Iran

327
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,200
can accelerate its nuclear program.

328
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,839
Suppose it is not destroyed, then

329
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,760
that is your entire AI and it has

330
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,519
also said that Iran has had enough of its stuff and

331
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,320
we are withdrawing from the NPT.  We do

332
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,720
n't want NPT.  Fourth brother, the entire world

333
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,639
can go on the verge of destruction

334
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,720
because all the energy is controlled from here.  The

335
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,480
oil prices have gone

336
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,639
up a lot and if this continues for

337
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,399
a month and a half, then friends, the

338
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,959
petrol which is available in India for ₹100, can go up to 150

339
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,880
and then the inflation will also reach its peak

340
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,200
because Iran is saying that we will

341
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,880
attack the Red Sea.

342
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
They have attacked the Red Sea before as well but there is

343
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,959
also a misunderstanding that we will

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,480
not attack here.  Because then it will be the same thing

345
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,320
that you will have to face the anger of America

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
and the State of Hormone forces will block you.

347
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,000
20% of the energy goes from here only.  So

348
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
an energy crisis can be created

349
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,279
due to which the whole world can put pressure to

350
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,079
stop the war.

351
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,839
Iran can use this good strategy.  After that,

352
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,320
inflation can increase tremendously.  And

353
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,399
what did Russia do after that?

354
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,120
This is what he had said, look, Russia will

355
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,000
benefit a lot from this.  How will it benefit?

356
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,399
If Iran disrupts the energy, then

357
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,560
Russia has oil.  Russia

358
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,480
has energy.  Russia will say that now

359
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,079
remove the sanctions from us because when Iran is

360
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,079
not able to supply, we will supply.

361
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
We have stock.  If India buys

362
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,480
oil then Russia will benefit a lot.

363
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,519
After that the final Iranian

364
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,480
government collapse regime change may occur.

365
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,480
And here Benjamin leader Yahoo is continuously

366
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
saying the same thing to Iran.  Change the regime

367
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
brother, change the regime.  He is repeatedly saying that the

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,880
name Operation Rising Lion has been

369
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,600
kept for this very purpose.  Ok?  That people should rise

370
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,839
like lions and change the regime.  So

371
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,839
this is the main plan of America and Israel.  But

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,480
friends, this seems very difficult.

373
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,800
Maybe if America jumps in.  The sudden

374
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,560
collapse will be like post-war Iraq.  Just

375
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,560
like America

376
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
entered Libya because they had weapons.

377
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Nothing was found.  That is why I entered Iraq also.

378
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,040
Saddam Hussein was hanged.  But even today

379
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,639
Iran is unstable.  A similar

380
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,199
situation may arise in Iran.  But this will

381
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,760
give people happy freedom from extremism.

382
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,760

383
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,000
When America goes to the place where there is fundamentalism and the condition of women, then

384
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,800
see that there is one good thing about America.  This

385
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,440
thing is a million things bad.  But one thing is

386
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,519
right that America opens up the economy

387
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
and America gives freedom to the people.  Like

388
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,600
in Afghanistan, America tried hard to have a

389
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,320
democratic election.  Schools should be built,

390
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,120
women should go there, they should study and those who are there actively should

391
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,279
run the government.  America does this.

392
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,360
So this benefit can be availed by the people

393
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,680
because somewhere people's anger is

394
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,519
suppressed in Iran.  After that,

395
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,519
civilian casualties are occurring.

396
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,600
But it is happening in Israel too.

397
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,240
A hospital in Israel was also attacked.  So far, friends,

398
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,160
many people have been killed.  Nearly 600

399
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
people were killed including 70 women and

400
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,040
children and see the unofficial figure would be quite high.

401
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,160
So now here it

402
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,440
may happen that if there is a civilian casualty and

403
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,240
Israel kills, which it is doing, then the

404
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,639
public may organize a rally in support of Iran.

405
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,480
However, the biggest

406
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,560
thing is that there is no organised opposition.

407
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,560
So when there

408
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
is no organised opposition then how can you work?

409
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,199
This is the accounting.  There are no forms for third parties.

410
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,600
Europe is already

411
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,759
marginalized.  Is it okay?  America, this is

412
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,320
only America, Israel and no one else.  No

413
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,279
one from India

414
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,800
can enter into it.  Now however here Iran is

415
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
saying that we are talking to America.

416
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,720
Some Geneva efforts are also being made to

417
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,959
revive the negotiations.

418
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,000
Everything is happening.  But for now friends,

419
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,519
let us assume that the end is that only

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,759
one person will win here.  We'll see what happens going forward.

421
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,279
Apart from this, you must avail our courses.  The

422
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,800

423
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,160
link to the public speaking course description is given in the comment box.

424
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,279
Be happy, keep reading.  This is

425
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,279
Siddhant Agnihotri signing off.
