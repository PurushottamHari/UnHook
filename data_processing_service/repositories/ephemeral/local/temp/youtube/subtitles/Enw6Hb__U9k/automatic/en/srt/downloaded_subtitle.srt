1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,839
This entire house was destroyed in one night.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,880
Look at this.  These shells fell in your house.  It

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,280
is attached here.  Here, the walls, the

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,160
TV, everything is broken.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,920
My mother's face was completely cut.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,439
Because of him my mother died.  These are the

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,640
shells that fell not just on walls but right in the

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,240
middle of people's lives.  This

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,039
shell has fallen.  Here too.  They can see that the

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,559
tree has been cut.  The

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:39,360
entire city becomes a ghost town as war shells fall on the heads of innocent people.

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:43,040
Like Uri is just 10 km from the border.

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,200
Shells fell here far away for a week.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
You will remember that time differently.  You will

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,399
not see anything else.  You will say that an idol is hovering over your head.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,280
We made this video

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,239
with the help of our local Kashmiri followers who visited this house.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,680
When the whole family of this house

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,760
ran away in fear in the car, it brought back only painful memories.  The

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,320
lights of our car came on and the entire

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,320
car was in the air.  Because of the wind we went all up

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,439
and down.  The face was completely cut.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,799
My mother's blood had

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,000
become so warm.  It was coming out from his entire mouth.

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,560
Because of him my mother

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,759
died.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,040
When there is a war between two countries, another

28
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,680
war is to save everyday life.   The

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,640

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,280
battle to save children, farming, and earnings.  Only Allah used to hear our voices

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,920
and no one else, no one else.   It

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,200
came from here, it came from here.  And

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,159
look, it has fallen here.  Nobody

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,200
threw us out.  We ran away ourselves.  We ran away ourselves.  There

35
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,479
is a veranda.  Veranda veranda that's where we

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,520
hid.  My knees were bruised.  The

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,399
children, the children, had fallen unconscious.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,880
Our mother will not be able to come back.  She was

39
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,840
martyred for the country.  We are happy with that.

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,640
But we are thinking about it.  We appeal

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,039
to the government that if we have to fight a war then we have to do anything.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,520
First keep the people safe.

43
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,840
If you were a banker, you would have been safe.  There is

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,120
no need for us to run away here.  We are

45
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,840
not going anywhere.  Our whole family had left

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,200
together.  We went sitting on top of each other.

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,319
This is Sajjad who

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,440
fled to Safely with his family but when he returned he saw that the

49
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,599
house he had built with hard work had collapsed.  So this

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,599
house is completely damaged.

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,720
This kitchen was what was left.  His

52
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,280
door has been torn from here.  And because of the

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,519
pressure exerted by his voice, this window has also been destroyed.

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,519

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,000
This is the main door outside.  The shelling is

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,319
here and went out from here.  If there

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,319
were any humans here, Allah should have saved

58
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,319
them.   There has

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,519
n't been so much swelling before.  We

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,080
called SAO sir and told him that we needed a car.   Let

61
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,159
us get out of here.  S SAO sir said

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
now wait for 10-20 minutes.  The car will reach you.

63
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,560
Now I have to go out again.  But we were so

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,519
scared, so terrified.  For that reason, we

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,080
left before him with our car.  Neither

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,720
clothes are left nor anything is left.  Our entire house

67
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,159
became a demolition.  At present, we

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,120
live on rent in many places.  It is difficult to even imagine that

69
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,879
scene when one's own room becomes a corner of death.  It

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,720
takes years to nurture the home.  But it

71
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,640
only takes one night to destroy everything.   There

72
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,879
was a lot of loss.  We haven't even taken out any stuff yet.  The

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,360
children's bags are inside

74
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,239
and we don't even have books and clothes to put inside.  It's

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,040
completely finished from top to bottom.

76
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,360
While drills were going on across the country, this

77
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,360
city did not even receive any warning.   He

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,680
just told us that there will be a blackout.   Switch

79
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,159
off the lights completely.  If it is fair

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,200
then don't leave from where you come.   I was

81
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,280
asleep at night.  First, there was an explosion.

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,439
Then another one happened.  Then my son called me.  He

83
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,000
said, Papa, there are explosions happening.  So

84
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,159
I told him to go to sleep, there is no such issue right now.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
So when more shelling started happening,

86
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,319
I kept some of the children and family

87
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
under the stairs and took some to the back room.

88
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,639

89
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,440
Odoo has helped us to bring this video to you.  Odoo is a business

at Mahatma Mandir, Gandhinagar.  So what are you

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
waiting for?  Register from the link

106
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
below.  There is no banker in this village.  At present no

107
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
one has a banker in the entire Udi.  The

108
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,199
entire Udi has been destroyed.  You can see the

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,800
loss; you can see for yourself

110
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,440
how much loss has occurred.  We have

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,960
seen Uri a lot in news and movies.  But have you

112
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,680
ever heard of the people of Uri?  It is

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,320
necessary to have bunkers in every border village.  If there were no bunkers, the

114
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,080
house itself would become a battle field

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,639
and the entire city would be a picture of destruction.

116
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,440
Banker is very important and along with him there should be

117
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,800
some relief also so that he

118
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,840
can do something.  Let us come and live here again.  The firing

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,759
started and we were all in the car.  So when the

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,919
shuffling became too much, we saw that this

121
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
house was going to be demolished.  So we ran away from here.   After getting

122
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,320

123
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,639
out from here with great difficulty after hiding, there is another small house.  We

124
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,199
sat in it.  On top of that, the shelling that happened

125
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,320
also caused damage.  We sat like this the whole night.

126
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,199

127
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,000
A war changes the lives of many people.   Of

128
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,039
those brave soldiers who risk their lives

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,800
so that we can continue to live in this country.

130
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,600
I am very proud.  My father was martyred.

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,720
But also of those families who do

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,120
n't even get a chance to save their lives amidst this war.  We would have

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,000
cast our votes, we would have voted for everyone.  He used to

134
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,880
promise us that we will

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,680
do everything for the people.  So if he had to do

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,639
all this.  You should have alerted us first.   By

137
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,600
killing us people in this manner, by

138
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,400
destroying our parents, we lost even our shadow.  At

139
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,039
this time, during the country's major wars, the

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,000
small border villages travel the most.

141
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,400
This country expands like this.  Even today children are scared.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Not living in homes.  Whenever there is a

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,160
task or a dish is rung, the

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,080
kids hide.  Tell me what

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
will you do?  There should be peace here too.  There

146
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,639
should be peace there too.  They are dying.  They are dying.  The

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,319
poor man is dying.  The poor will die from there too.

148
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,199
Poor people are dying here also.   It is the

149
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,039
common people who are travelling mostly in this.  If, for

150
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,840
example, they have to fight.  We are not

151
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,000
saying don't fight.  But first

152
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,479
save the people.  There were big gifts.   I was

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,960
very scared of them.  The children got scared and started crying.

154
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,560
We all ran away from here.  Look, this war

155
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,319
should not happen.  Yes.  People are facing a lot of

156
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
loss due to this.  People are not able to sleep.

157
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,440
This is because of this fear.

158
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,919
All the people here right now are in fear.  This was the

159
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,720
time when the country's attention

160
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,080
turned towards the national media.  But the national media

161
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,360
ran fake alert news.  There has been

162
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,840
huge devastation in Lahore and Islamabad.  An innocent person was

163
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,720
declared a terrorist.  After Operation Sindoor,

164
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,720
information is now being received about terrorist Mohammad

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,520
Iqbal also.  A panic was spread by repeatedly sounding war sirens

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,960
and even

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,960
calling the games videos as war videos.

168
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,319
What do I think of this nonsense

169
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,400
?  Whose hatred increased so much when the war stopped

170
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,280
that he started abusing our own country's Foreign

171
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,919
Secretary.  When the

172
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,319
enemy country was trying to break our unity.

173
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,280
When the army was fighting them,

174
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,800
why was our national media still supporting that country?

175
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,360
I have a passionate love for

176
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
our country.  That's why I maintain my aim to

177
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,440

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,319
bring to you stories from every district of India in a genuine and honest manner.  So will you

179
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,319
tell me what is special in your district?
