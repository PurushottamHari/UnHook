This entire house was destroyed in one night. Look at this.  These shells fell in your house.  It is attached here.  Here, the walls, the TV, everything is broken. My mother's face was completely cut. Because of him my mother died.  These are the shells that fell not just on walls but right in the middle of people's lives.  This shell has fallen.  Here too.  They can see that the tree has been cut.  The entire city becomes a ghost town as war shells fall on the heads of innocent people. Like Uri is just 10 km from the border. Shells fell here far away for a week. You will remember that time differently.  You will not see anything else.  You will say that an idol is hovering over your head. We made this video with the help of our local Kashmiri followers who visited this house. When the whole family of this house ran away in fear in the car, it brought back only painful memories.  The lights of our car came on and the entire car was in the air.  Because of the wind we went all up and down.  The face was completely cut. My mother's blood had become so warm.  It was coming out from his entire mouth. Because of him my mother died. When there is a war between two countries, another war is to save everyday life.   The battle to save children, farming, and earnings.  Only Allah used to hear our voices and no one else, no one else.   It came from here, it came from here.  And look, it has fallen here.  Nobody threw us out.  We ran away ourselves.  We ran away ourselves.  There is a veranda.  Veranda veranda that's where we hid.  My knees were bruised.  The children, the children, had fallen unconscious. Our mother will not be able to come back.  She was martyred for the country.  We are happy with that. But we are thinking about it.  We appeal to the government that if we have to fight a war then we have to do anything. First keep the people safe. If you were a banker, you would have been safe.  There is no need for us to run away here.  We are not going anywhere.  Our whole family had left together.  We went sitting on top of each other. This is Sajjad who fled to Safely with his family but when he returned he saw that the house he had built with hard work had collapsed.  So this house is completely damaged. This kitchen was what was left.  His door has been torn from here.  And because of the pressure exerted by his voice, this window has also been destroyed. This is the main door outside.  The shelling is here and went out from here.  If there were any humans here, Allah should have saved them.   There has n't been so much swelling before.  We called SAO sir and told him that we needed a car.   Let us get out of here.  S SAO sir said now wait for 10-20 minutes.  The car will reach you. Now I have to go out again.  But we were so scared, so terrified.  For that reason, we left before him with our car.  Neither clothes are left nor anything is left.  Our entire house became a demolition.  At present, we live on rent in many places.  It is difficult to even imagine that scene when one's own room becomes a corner of death.  It takes years to nurture the home.  But it only takes one night to destroy everything.   There was a lot of loss.  We haven't even taken out any stuff yet.  The children's bags are inside and we don't even have books and clothes to put inside.  It's completely finished from top to bottom. While drills were going on across the country, this city did not even receive any warning.   He just told us that there will be a blackout.   Switch off the lights completely.  If it is fair then don't leave from where you come.   I was asleep at night.  First, there was an explosion. Then another one happened.  Then my son called me.  He said, Papa, there are explosions happening.  So I told him to go to sleep, there is no such issue right now. So when more shelling started happening, I kept some of the children and family under the stairs and took some to the back room. Odoo has helped us to bring this video to you.

You can see the loss; you can see for yourself how much loss has occurred.  We have seen Uri a lot in news and movies.  But have you ever heard of the people of Uri?  It is necessary to have bunkers in every border village.  If there were no bunkers, the house itself would become a battle field and the entire city would be a picture of destruction. Banker is very important and along with him there should be some relief also so that he can do something.  Let us come and live here again.  The firing started and we were all in the car.  So when the shuffling became too much, we saw that this house was going to be demolished.  So we ran away from here.   After getting out from here with great difficulty after hiding, there is another small house.  We sat in it.  On top of that, the shelling that happened also caused damage.  We sat like this the whole night. A war changes the lives of many people.   Of those brave soldiers who risk their lives so that we can continue to live in this country. I am very proud.  My father was martyred. But also of those families who do n't even get a chance to save their lives amidst this war.  We would have cast our votes, we would have voted for everyone.  He used to promise us that we will do everything for the people.  So if he had to do all this.  You should have alerted us first.   By killing us people in this manner, by destroying our parents, we lost even our shadow.  At this time, during the country's major wars, the small border villages travel the most. This country expands like this.  Even today children are scared. Not living in homes.  Whenever there is a task or a dish is rung, the kids hide.  Tell me what will you do?  There should be peace here too.  There should be peace there too.  They are dying.  They are dying.  The poor man is dying.  The poor will die from there too. Poor people are dying here also.   It is the common people who are travelling mostly in this.  If, for example, they have to fight.  We are not saying don't fight.  But first save the people.  There were big gifts.   I was very scared of them.  The children got scared and started crying. We all ran away from here.  Look, this war should not happen.  Yes.  People are facing a lot of loss due to this.  People are not able to sleep. This is because of this fear. All the people here right now are in fear.  This was the time when the country's attention turned towards the national media.  But the national media ran fake alert news.  There has been huge devastation in Lahore and Islamabad.  An innocent person was declared a terrorist.  After Operation Sindoor, information is now being received about terrorist Mohammad Iqbal also.  A panic was spread by repeatedly sounding war sirens and even calling the games videos as war videos. What do I think of this nonsense ?  Whose hatred increased so much when the war stopped that he started abusing our own country's Foreign Secretary.  When the enemy country was trying to break our unity. When the army was fighting them, why was our national media still supporting that country? I have a passionate love for our country.  That's why I maintain my aim to bring to you stories from every district of India in a genuine and honest manner.  So will you tell me what is special in your district?
