I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So what will Iran do?  Will he talk or negotiate?  So, we will tell you the possibility of both.

So brother, look, we have already told you all this, what has happened and what has not happened, regional credibility, such and such blast, so now let us talk about that, after all we all know why Iran was attacked and how it happened, yesterday Operation Hammer was hit at night, who does this, blow it up, so what are the factors due to which Iran will negotiate, so let's talk one by one, the first factor, so brother, look, if the regime that came in 197-79 does not survive, then how will things work?  So his survival is very important. And if this war continues for long then people will not want war.  So look, our President Pazshkiya Masood Padshkiya prefers diplomacy more. He is a little stable.  But look, he does n't have anything in his hand.  All control is in the hands of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.  So he will see everything and he is in the bunker.  The IRGC has said, son America, be ready. We are coming.  If they come then it is possible that this may lead to negotiations. Iran is not capable of a full scale confrontation.  Russia has promised support.  But look, you have to fight the war.  The war is not taking place on Russian soil. This war is happening on your land. So that is what you are saying, it is easy to give opinion. Providing supplies is also easy.  There are no free lunches.  Nobody is giving anything for free. China is also not providing any help for free. Ok?  Obviously China has a strategic advantage. But what happened in 1980?  There was a war between Iran and Iraq and it lasted for eight years. Ultimately Iran came to the table and at that time, you know, Israel helped Iran.  Why?  What happened was that when America left Iran, because before this the Pahlavi dynasty, Reza Pahlavi, used to oppose America, so what did they do, America was largely in Iran at that time and had left a lot of its weapons but there were no spare parts for them, so now it is obvious that Iran could not directly ask for help from America, the relations were very bad, so they asked for help and then America asked Israel to give them spare parts, okay, and then Iran in a way promised to help America. So it is not like this has happened before and the talks were still going on but now it is not understood what America is doing.  On one hand he says that friend, we have been planning this for weeks and months. So we actually don't know what's happening here.  Now if this has been going on for weeks or months, then brother why was this talk going on again?  Donald Trump should understand this again.  So, one should understand what he is saying.  So Tehran may talk because see, this is the climax and till now America has never carried out a direct attack.  This direct attack is the first time that America has directly entered the war and warnings are coming from there too but the way for talks is open.  Iran knows that if this escalates further, it will become a huge problem.  There is also news that perhaps Pakistan has attacked from its own airbase. Ok?  After that the option of back channel diplomacy will always remain.  It is being said that America had already told Iran that if we are going to attack you then we will die for you.  So the thing is that this entire canvas that you are seeing already looks like it was painted. This competition has not happened immediately.  Everything has already been told to me.  There might be a script that I have memorized like, look friend, something has to be done.  We also have to show the world that if we attack Iran, then Iran will have to do this and you will strike here. So brother, look, its possibility is less but it is there. Ok?  It is also possible that Iran may have been informed in advance and discussions may be taking place through diplomatic back channels that look, we will attack them with your nuclear weapons and you should deescalate.  Ok?  So that there are no casualties, you should remove your people from there. Then geopolitical pressure.  Well one more thing, the previous point is also proved because not a single missile was fired from Iran's side. His defense system, in fact, it is being said in Fado that he had put in place the entire defense system. Brother, wherever your treasury is, you will put all your force there, but not a single missile came from Iran, so it is possible that back channel diplomacy is still going on and friends, I feel that Iran will attack and then after a week and a half, it will come to the table, people also have to be explained, there is geopolitical pressure, there is Saudi, UAE, Qatar, the entire Gulf region, Saudi and when it is the Gulf region, it says only this that look, we America are our parents and Iran is not just our enemy, it is certainly an enemy because if Saudi says that we are its protectors of Mecca and Medina.  Isn't it? First they will call themselves Gulf countries, but we are the protectors of these, which are the holiest sites of Islam.  Ok?  Iran says no no, we will talk about it later. But look at us, we are not from today, you have just become a new country.  Our area is also bigger.  We are Shias and we have been existing for a long time.  Ok?  So all these countries know that regional instability will increase because Iran will not attack America.  Iran will attack their countries because America has bases here and this is the thing that it is a big disadvantage of befriending America, Guru, that if you build a base then your land will be attacked, America will come later to save you, so the thing is that America and after that this double standard attitude brother, now suppose Saudi did not want America to attack Iran, but America did it, it was not in Saudi's interest, so now you have to suffer, then this is what happens, so that is why the broad border conflict should not happen and Iran knows this.  Then after that the negotiating strength which their current cabinet has.  Isn't it?  From Iran's Abbas Arakshi to Padashia, all of them are good negotiators. He also did very good negotiation in JCPOA and he keeps saying this again and again.  He said the same thing earlier also.  You must have heard his name a lot from my mouth and also that look brother, we are ready to come to the table.  We were just talking.  You were the one who backed off. That is why they can get global sympathy and legitimacy due to victimhood. Ok?  And obviously they can avail of these concessions also.  And look at Don Trump, he has satisfied his ego. Ok?  Now they have nothing to do with it.  Now he will start shouting Nobel Peace Peace again.  But let Donald Trump play whatever he wants to in the mid-term elections next year. Now we have discussed what is the path of peace. Now we see why Iran can escalate what it is.  So the biggest thing is that if Iran does not attack then everyone will consider it a coward.   He has hit me so badly.  He entered the house and killed me. Till today it did not mean much to anyone but now it has a huge role in modern warfare and Iran is a powerful country.  It is not that it is a small country.  It is a historical country. So it's a question of credibility for Iran. Nathan Fado Isan and I just took a lecture that perhaps their nuclear program hasn't even been destroyed.  Everything that was there had already been shifted.  But all the hard liners are demanding that you have to give a forceful response by doing anything.  This is what happened with Pakistan in Operation Sindoor.  India hit hard.  India was saying that we do not want to escalate.  But all the hardliners there said, no, why are you not attacking India ?  They had to attack under pressure but de-escalation happened after four days.  So, do something similar here also so that you do not appear weak.  If you look weak, people will respect you, no one respects the weak.  Brother, if I am not free without you then I will have to kill you, brother.  This same leader had said yesterday that power comes only when strength comes.  So now the Parliament has also said that they have approved the Majlis of Iran which was created in the beginning of 20-21 century so that the king of the 20th century should not become so autocratic.  So this is a question of credibility of Iran here and if this does not happen then it will be a big problem, oh friend, this is the big problem.  Ok?  So the problem can be created.  I will open it again. After that, friends, I will tell you about China.  Look, this is true but China is a big factor because China will be the happiest. Although China has directly come in support of Iran and China has directly said that brother, we are ready to give everything for Iran.  Russia has also come in support. Ok?  So these two countries, China, supported Iran right from the beginning. But now China knows that if we talk then we will be defeated. It was China that had facilitated friendship between Saudi Arabia and Iran.  So they can emerge as heroes.  You should assume this. Right?  So it is possible that you know China may emerge as a hero in this and strategically it will be a big win for it. And he will also say that the leader of the Global South, just like Iran said to India yesterday that brother, you call yourself the leader of the Global South, then now show where you are the leader of the Global South.  But brother, India is not going to get into all these things. After that the IRGC is giving these threats all the time.  They are threatening every hour. He again threatened that he would attack in such a manner that the whole area would be engulfed in smoke. Not a single American will survive.  But this will not achieve anything.  The IRGC has complete power and comes under the Supreme Leader.  They have an army and a navy.  It doesn't make any sense. Army, Navy, nothing.  The army and navy are very weak.  Their army, navy, air force. Their main army is the IRGC and it is not under the President.  The President doesn't have it.  It is with the Supreme Leader.  So the IRGC is saying that brother, until we make America realize that until we kill America, nothing is going to happen. So there might be a cyber attack. Proxy groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis might be possible to attack whatever regional bases there are. After that, the Majlis is a pressure valve.  As I told you, first of all, if I were there, I would have immediately told you to withdraw from NPT. Remove it.  Now if you withdraw NPDC then what will happen is that now you can make bombs and now you can make them in large numbers, so it may also happen that brother, you should leave diplomacy because we have done diplomacy to a great extent.  Now the biggest thing is what I told you yesterday also that there will be tactical retaliation plus strategy negotiations.  There will be retaliation. Let us assume that Iran will attack but it will be limited.  Maybe they won't hit America and even if they do, there will be very limited retaliation.  But if even one point of America is attacked then it will react again. After that he can also talk about this. Why?  Let's talk about rebuilding nuclear capability. Sorry for the fight.  Strength first, okay we are weak.  Germany increased its power during World War II when it was first established. He didn't tell anyone until then.  He remained weak and poor.  But deep inside, he kept building his strength.  Then after that, in order to eliminate the domestic and economic pressure and to get back the sanctions relief that were going to be received, Iran can do this.  Talking about broader implications, friends, they are very big.  The first thing is that let us assume here that this is a nuclear threshold state
