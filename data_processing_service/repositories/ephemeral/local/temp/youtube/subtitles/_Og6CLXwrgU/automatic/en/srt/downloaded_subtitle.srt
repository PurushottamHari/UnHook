1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,919
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,040
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome to Study Gloss.  So

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,160
what will Iran do?  Will he talk or

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,199
negotiate?  So,

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
we will tell you the possibility of both.  The

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,160
link to the Personality Development Chanakya Niti course is

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,760

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
So brother, look, we have already told you all this,

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,320
what has happened and what has not happened,

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,600
regional credibility, such and such blast,

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,760
so now let us talk about that, after all we all

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,960
know why Iran was attacked and

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,800
how it happened, yesterday Operation Hammer was hit

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
at night, who does this,

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,600
blow it up, so

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
what are the factors due to which Iran

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,520
will negotiate, so let's talk one by one, the

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,160
first factor, so brother, look, if the

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,559
regime that came in 197-79 does

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,199
not survive, then how will things work?  So

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,239
his survival is very important.

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,360
And if this war continues for long then people will

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,960
not want war.  So look, our

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,280
President Pazshkiya Masood Padshkiya

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,960
prefers diplomacy more.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,600
He is a little stable.  But look, he does

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,799
n't have anything in his hand.  All control is

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,680
in the hands of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.  So he

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,759
will see everything and he is in the bunker.  The IRGC has

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,240
said, son America, be ready.

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:33,600
We are coming.  If they come then it is

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,799
possible that this may lead to negotiations.

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,759

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,360
Iran is not capable of a full scale confrontation.  Russia has

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,520
promised support.  But look,

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,680
you have to fight the war.  The war is not taking place on Russian soil.

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,640
This war is happening on your land.

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,360
So that is what you are saying, it is easy to give opinion.

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,200
Providing supplies is also easy.  There are

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,280
no free lunches.  Nobody is giving anything for free.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,240
China is also not providing any help for free.

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,799
Ok?  Obviously China has a

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,479
strategic advantage.

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,920
But what happened in 1980?  There was a war between Iran and Iraq

47
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,399
and it lasted for eight years.

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,120
Ultimately Iran came to the table and at that time,

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,400
you know, Israel

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,879
helped Iran.  Why?  What happened was that

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,840
when America left Iran, because

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,959
before this the Pahlavi dynasty, Reza Pahlavi, used to

53
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,840
oppose America,

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,160
so what did they do, America

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,319
was largely in Iran at that time and had

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,160
left a lot of its weapons but there were

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,599
no spare parts for them, so now it is obvious that

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,680
Iran could not directly ask for help from America, the

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,640
relations were very bad, so

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
they asked for help and then

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,920
America asked Israel to give them

62
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,640
spare parts, okay, and then

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,040
Iran in a way promised to help America.

64
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,360
So it is not like this has happened before and the

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959
talks were still going on but now it is

66
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
not understood what America is doing.  On

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,480
one hand he says that friend, we have been

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
planning this for weeks and months.

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,280
So we actually don't know

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
what's happening here.  Now if this has been going on for weeks or

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
months, then brother why was this talk

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,879
going on again?  Donald Trump

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,040
should understand this again.  So, one

74
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,760
should understand what he is saying.  So Tehran may

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760
talk because see, this

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,440
is the climax and till now America has never carried out a

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,440
direct attack.  This direct

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,000
attack is the first time that America has directly entered the

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,319
war and warnings are coming from there too

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,800
but the way for talks is open.  Iran

81
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,120
knows that if this escalates further, it will become a

82
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200
huge problem.  There is

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,280
also news that perhaps Pakistan has

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,959
attacked from its own airbase.

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,920
Ok?  After that the

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,239
option of back channel diplomacy will always remain.  It is being said

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,720
that America had already told Iran

88
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,760
that if we are going to attack you then

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,080
we will die for you.  So the thing is that

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
this entire canvas that you are seeing

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,480
already looks like it was painted.

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
This competition has not happened immediately.  Everything has

93
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,400
already been told to me.  There

94
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,720
might be a script that I have memorized like, look

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,319
friend, something has to be done.  We also have to

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,319
show the world that if we attack Iran, then Iran will have to do

97
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
this and you will strike here.

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,920
So brother, look, its possibility is less but it is there.

99
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,159
Ok?  It is also possible that

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,040
Iran may have been informed in advance and discussions may be taking place through diplomatic back

101
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,239
channels that look, we

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,440
will attack them with your nuclear weapons and you

103
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,199
should deescalate.  Ok?  So that there are

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,000
no casualties, you should remove your people from there.

105
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,919
Then geopolitical pressure.  Well one more

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,919
thing, the previous point is also

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,919
proved because not a single missile was fired from Iran's side.

108
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,520
His defense

109
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,759
system, in fact, it is being said in Fado that

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,880
he had put in place the entire defense system.

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,520
Brother, wherever your treasury is, you

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,000
will put all your force there, but not a single missile

113
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,160
came from Iran, so it is possible that

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,320
back channel diplomacy is still going on and

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,639
friends, I feel that Iran

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,040
will attack and then after a week and a half, it will come to the table,

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,840
people also have to be explained, there is

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,960
geopolitical pressure, there is Saudi, UAE,

119
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,720
Qatar, the entire Gulf region, Saudi and when it is the

120
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,199
Gulf region, it says only this that

121
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,759
look, we America are our parents and Iran is not just

122
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,080
our enemy, it is certainly an enemy

123
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,680
because if Saudi says that we are

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,600
 

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
its protectors of Mecca and Medina.  Isn't it?

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
First they will call themselves Gulf countries, but we

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,320
are the protectors of these, which are the

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,720
holiest sites of Islam.  Ok?  Iran says

129
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,400
no no, we will talk about it later.

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
But look at us, we are not from today, you have

131
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,320
just become a new country.  Our area is also

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,280
bigger.  We are Shias and we have been

133
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,199
existing for a long time.  Ok?  So

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,039
all these countries know that regional

135
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
instability will increase because Iran will

136
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,199
not attack America.  Iran

137
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,960
will attack their countries because America has bases

138
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,280
here and this is the thing that

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,080
it is a big disadvantage of befriending America,

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,560
Guru, that if you build a base then your land will be

141
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,160
attacked, America will come later to

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,560
save you, so the thing is that America and

143
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,560
after that this double standard attitude brother, now suppose

144
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,720
Saudi did not want

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,840
America to attack Iran, but America did it,

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,360
it was not in Saudi's interest, so now

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,039
you have to suffer, then this is what happens, so that is why the

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
broad border conflict

149
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,120
should not happen and Iran knows this.  Then after that the

150
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,080
negotiating strength which their current

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,039
cabinet has.  Isn't it?  From Iran's Abbas

152
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,919
Arakshi to Padashia, all of them are

153
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,240
good negotiators.

154
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,160
He also did very good negotiation in JCPOA and he keeps

155
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
saying this again and again.  He

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,000
said the same thing earlier also.  You must have heard his name a lot

157
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,000
from my mouth and also that look brother, we are

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,479
ready to come to the table.  We were just

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,280
talking.  You were the one who backed off.

160
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,440
That is why they can get global sympathy

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
and legitimacy due to victimhood.

162
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,919
Ok?  And obviously they

163
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
can avail of these concessions also.  And

164
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,199
look at Don Trump, he has satisfied his ego.

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,000
Ok?  Now they have

166
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,400
nothing to do with it.  Now he will

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
start shouting Nobel Peace Peace again.  But let Donald Trump play

168
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,240
whatever he wants to in the mid-term elections next year.

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,120
Now

170
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,759
we have discussed what is the path of peace.

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,160
Now we see why Iran

172
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,840
can escalate what it is.  So the biggest thing is

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,639
that if Iran does not attack

174
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,120
then everyone will consider it a coward.   He has

175
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,520
hit me so badly.  He entered the house and killed me.

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,840
Till today it did not mean much to anyone

177
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
but now it has a huge role in modern warfare

178
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
and Iran is a powerful country.  It is

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,360
not that it is a small country.  It is a historical country.

180
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,479
So it's a question of credibility for Iran.

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
Nathan Fado Isan and I just took a lecture

182
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,199
that perhaps their nuclear

183
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,120
program hasn't even been destroyed.  Everything that was there had already been

184
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,360
shifted.  But

185
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,280
all the hard liners are demanding

186
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,960
that you have to

187
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
give a forceful response by doing anything.  This is what happened with Pakistan

188
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
in Operation Sindoor.  India

189
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,000
hit hard.  India was saying that we do

190
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
not want to escalate.  But all the

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
hardliners there said, no,

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
why are you not attacking India

193
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
?  They had to attack under pressure but

194
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,599
de-escalation happened after four days.  So, do

195
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,360
something similar here also so that you do not

196
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,039
appear weak.  If you look weak, people will respect you,

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,560
no one respects the weak.  Brother, if I am not

198
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,199
free without you then I will have to kill you, brother.  This

199
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,759
same leader had said yesterday that

200
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,120
power comes only when strength comes.  So now the

201
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
Parliament has also said that

202
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,960
they have approved the Majlis of Iran

203
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,440
which was created in the beginning of 20-21 century

204
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,800

205
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,199
so that the king of the 20th century should

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,599
not become so autocratic.  So this

207
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,199
is a question of credibility of Iran here and if this does

208
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,199
not happen then it will be a big problem, oh friend, this is the big

209
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,639
problem.  Ok?  So the problem can be

210
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
created.  I will open it again.

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,720

212
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,879
After that, friends, I will

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
tell you about China.  Look, this is true

214
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,919
but China is a big factor

215
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,000
because China will be the happiest.

216
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,240
Although China has directly come in support of Iran

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,599
and China has directly said

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,120
that brother, we are ready to give everything

219
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,760
for Iran.  Russia has also come in support.

220
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,680
Ok?  So these two countries, China,

221
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,040
supported Iran right from the beginning.

222
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,000
But now China knows that if

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,399
we talk then we will be defeated. It was

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,560
China that had facilitated friendship between Saudi Arabia and Iran.  So

225
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,120
they can emerge as heroes.  You should assume this.

226
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,040
Right?  So it is possible that you know China may

227
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,800
emerge as a hero in this and

228
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
strategically it will be a big win for it.

229
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,640
And he will also say that the leader of the Global South,

230
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,760
just like Iran said to India yesterday that

231
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,080
brother, you call yourself the leader of the Global South,

232
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,519
then now show where

233
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
you are the leader of the Global South.  But brother,

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,920
India is not going to get into all these things.

235
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,360
After that the IRGC is giving these threats all the time.  They are

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,519
threatening every hour.

237
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,279
He again threatened that he would attack in such a manner that the

238
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,279
whole area would be engulfed in smoke.

239
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,519
Not a single American will survive.  But this will

240
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,680
not achieve anything.  The IRGC has complete power and

241
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
comes under the Supreme Leader.  They

242
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,160
have an army and a navy.  It doesn't make any sense.

243
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
Army, Navy, nothing.  The army and navy are very

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,040
weak.  Their army, navy, air force.

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,440
Their main army is the IRGC and it is

246
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,480

247
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,120
not under the President.  The President doesn't have it.  It

248
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,080
is with the Supreme Leader.  So the IRGC is

249
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,240
saying that brother, until we make America

250
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,240
realize that until we

251
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,839
kill America, nothing is going to happen.

252
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,760
So there might be a cyber attack.

253
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,480
Proxy groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis might be

254
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,720
possible to attack whatever regional bases there are.

255
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,320
After that, the Majlis is

256
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,959
a pressure valve.  As I

257
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,800
told you, first of all, if I

258
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,800
were there, I would have immediately told you to withdraw from NPT.

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,519
Remove it.  Now if you withdraw NPDC

260
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,040
then what will happen is that now you can make bombs

261
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,279
and now you can make them in large numbers, so it

262
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,440
may also happen that brother, you should

263
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,399
leave diplomacy because

264
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,240
we have done diplomacy to a great extent.  Now the biggest thing is

265
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,000
what I told you yesterday also that there will be

266
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,560
tactical retaliation plus strategy

267
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,959
negotiations.  There will be retaliation.

268
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,120
Let us assume that Iran will attack but it will be

269
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,800
limited.  Maybe they won't hit America

270
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,279
and even if they do, there will be very limited

271
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
retaliation.  But if even one point of America is

272
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,160
attacked then it will react again.

273
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,480
After that he can also talk about this.

274
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,320
Why?  Let's talk about rebuilding nuclear capability.

275
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800

276
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Sorry for the fight.  Strength first, okay we

277
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,480
are weak.  Germany increased its power

278
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,640
during World War II when it was first established.

279
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
He didn't tell anyone until then.  He

280
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
remained weak and poor.  But deep inside, he kept

281
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,720
building his strength.  Then after that, in order to

282
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,079
eliminate the domestic and economic pressure and to

283
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,040

284
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,440
get back the sanctions relief that were going to be received, Iran

285
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,440
can do this.  Talking about broader implications,

286
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,000
friends, they are very big.  The

287
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,079
first thing is that let us

288
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,120
assume here that this is a nuclear

289
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,120
threshold state
