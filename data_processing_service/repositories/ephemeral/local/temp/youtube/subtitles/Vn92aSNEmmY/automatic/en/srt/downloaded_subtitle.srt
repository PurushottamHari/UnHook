00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello Friends.  Friends,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,799
speculations were being made about many things in the Israel-Iran war.  There were

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,280
many questions whether the

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,440
B2 bomber would be used?  Will

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,519
America jump into this war?  Because it was being

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,920
said that after two weeks,

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
America will decide whether to

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,359
attack Iran or not?  But some time ago

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,680
something happened due to which Iran's

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,920
entire nuclear program has gone back several years

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,080
because America

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,480
bombed Iran.  And you

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,399
can see that US strikes three Iranian

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,559
sites because the

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,880
three most important nuclear sites of Iran have been

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,960
attacked and in a way the

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
US has joined this entire war.

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,879
So let us understand this in a little detail as to

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,320
what exactly happened?  What was the B to Bumber

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,000
used for?  Why is the bomb

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
used in it so dangerous

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,160
?  What could happen next?

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,160
I will tell you all that in detail.  First let us

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,879
see what exactly happened?  Look,

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,280
just a short while ago, Donald Trump

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,760
posted on social media and confirmed that

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
America has taken military action

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,640
against Iran and attacked three Iranian nuclear

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,119
sites.

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,159
Can you see what is written here?  We have

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,240
completed our very successful attack on the

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,080
three nuclear sites in Iran.  And

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
which are these three nuclear sites?  Well,

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,640
if you look inside Iran, you will find many

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
nuclear sites.  There are some

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,280
research facilities, some nuclear power

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
plants, some uranium mines.  But the

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
three most important ones are Iran's entire

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,320
nuclear program, under which it

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,640
can make bombs, you can see that

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,600
if you look below Tehran, the most important one is

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,240
Fado.  Then the second one is Nathan and below that

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,079
you will see Isan.  These are the three most

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,799
important nuclear sites

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,360
of Iran.  And if there has been devastation here, then in a

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,439
way Iran's entire program has been set back by several years.  Apart from

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
this, you

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,560
can see here that Trump wrote, A full

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,200
payload of bombs was dropped on the

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
primary site.  That means the primary site

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,240
in all these is your Fardo.  So Donald

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,439
Trump is confirming that Fado has also been

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,600
attacked.  And remember,

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,479
conventional weapons cannot be used on the For the.

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,319
This capability is only with drones,

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
i.e. America.  I will

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,000
tell you that.  Why?  Because the

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,319
stealth bomber used here

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,879
and the bomb used were the only thing that could

60
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,959
destroy Fardo.  And

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,000
Israel wanted that America should

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,920
help and destroy the Fado site.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,599
And you can see this here

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,400
Donald Trump says that there is no

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,440
other military in the world that could have done this.

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Now is the time for peace.  Donald

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,080
Trump is saying this.  Well, the first

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,680
question that arises here is why is this Fordow

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
so important?  And let

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,519
me tell you about these three sites first.

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
Look, if you look at this,

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,879
you can see this Fordow plant and this is a

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,000
mountain.

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,319
This entire site, located approximately 80 to 90 meters below the mountain, has been

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,080
built so that no one can attack it.

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,160
And if you look at this entire site carefully, then

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,239
this security check point where there is a

78
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,319
way to go, the support building, which means that the

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,080
site is below but the

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,239
building that has been built outside to support it,

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
you will see it here, the

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,319

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,319
way to go to the underground complex is mentioned here, so

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,120
you will get to see this entire structure and

85
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,840
this is basically very close to Com City,

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,720
this Fordo site and it

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,440
is thought to be immune to conventional

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,440
bombing, which means that if it has to be destroyed then only the

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
B2

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,959
bombers that America has can destroy it

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,480
because through that bomber, the 3000

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,840
pound bomb GBU 57, which means 13000

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,640
kg B bomb, which is a complete bomb, GBU 57 is

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,400
called a bunker buster bomb, it

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
can penetrate and destroy it.

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,799
I will also tell you in detail how this

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,519
works.  But in a way you should

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,480
understand that the Fado nuclear site was

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,720
targeted because highly enriched

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,200
uranium was produced here.

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,920
Meaning, there was enrichment at other sites as well,

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,760
but it was not so high.  It is

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,599
said here that

104
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,920
more than 60% of the enrichment was

105
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,080
done with uranium.  Well apart from this, the second one

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,239
again which is very important is Nathan which

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
you will get to see in Isan Province.

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,280
This is Iran's largest uranium enrichment

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,000
plant.  Where thousands of advanced

110
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,000
centrifuges were kept.  And it has

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
been the primary side for expanding

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,320
enrichment capabilities.  And it has been

113
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,000
attacked before also through cyber attacks etc.

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,040
And the result here is that by

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,520
destroying this, Iran's ability to

116
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
refine uranium quickly gets

117
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,080
destroyed.  And the third one that

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,720
you will find in this great province itself,

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,880
that is home to research reactor and

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,280
uranium conversion plant, that too has been

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,759
destroyed in a way.  Meaning, in

122
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,840
a way you can understand that the

123
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,160
entire supply chain that was built in the rest of the facilities will get

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,800
interrupted because of this.  So these

125
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,120
were the three biggest sites in Iran's nuclear

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,759
program.  Well now the question here is

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,600
how was all this done?  See

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,320
here I want to tell you that the US has

129
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,360

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,400
used stealth B-2 Spirit bombers which directly

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,120
enter the enemy airspace without being

132
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,120
detected.  That means, if you see, this

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
entire stealth bomber B2 bomber that

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
we are talking about, such

135
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,560
material has been used in it that it has the capability to absorb the radar,

136
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,160
meaning it has the capability to absorb the radar.

137
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
What happens normally is that

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,400
suppose the radar

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
sends radio wave signals from here, then after

140
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,720
colliding with the aircraft, it comes to know

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,560
where it is and at what distance it is.

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
But the kind of materials

143
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,600
used in it are quite dangerous.

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,840
And it is said in the world that it is

145
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
almost impossible for you to detect it.

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,919
Almost impossible with the kind of

147
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,919
technology that exists right now.  Well here let me

148
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,479
tell you that if you see

149
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,880
in the Indian Ocean region, this is Diego Garcia and

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,520
if you look

151
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,240
here in the Philippines, in the Pacific region, near it, there is Guam

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,880
Island.  It is told from both these places

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,919
that the stealth bombers were sent

154
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,639
towards Iran and after

155
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,479
attacking these three sites of Iran, they

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,479
came back.  Such complete planning was done

157
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,720
and here you can see that the

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,919
bomb that was used, especially

159
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,600
in Fado, was GBU 57 Massive Ordnance

160
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,840
Penetration. I will tell you in the next slide

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,759
what this is. And here

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,199
Trump says that after carrying out the bombing

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,400
very comfortably, without Iran getting to know about it, these

164
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,639
bombers did their job and came back.

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,880
Well why is this important because

166
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,880
only late last night, the news came that the

167
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,720
US has deployed B-2 bombers

168
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
in Guwahati.  Well,

169
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
why is Guam important?  I was

170
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
telling you that you will get to see this in the Pacific region.

171
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,479

172
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,160
If you look just on the eastern side of the Philippines, there is

173
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,919
Australia.  Japan is here.

174
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,319
Well, this is very important historically also.

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,800
This Gua Island is the same one

176
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,199
from where the Allied Forces launched

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,759
heavy attacks on Japan during World War II.  And

178
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,160
when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,

179
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,240
Japan also, in a way, took over

180
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,479
Guam.  Then it

181
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,120
is obvious that Japan loses.  But the

182
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,360
situation today is that you will find major US

183
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,319
naval and air bases in Guam.

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,880
Approximately 1/3 of Guam's area is

185
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,360
currently occupied by the US Armed Forces.

186
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,440
So in a way the news had come last night itself.

187
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,080
But no one had thought

188
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,479
that there would be bombing here so early in the morning today.

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,160
So B2 bombers were deployed in Goa.

190
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,400
Well, what is special about these B2

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
bombers?   The

192
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,639
most important thing which I was telling you about is

193
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,720
its stealth capability that

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,880
it enters the enemy country and it

195
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
cannot even be detected because everything fails.  The

196
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440

197
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,840
range of the entire radar system is 11,000 km.  It is said to be around.

198
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,599
By refueling it, one can travel a very long distance.  There

199
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,080

200
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,960
is a facility for mid year refueling.  Its payload is 18 tonnes.   This

201
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,879
means you can carry bombs weighing up to 4000 pounds

202
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,039
inside it.  And as

203
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,360
I told you, it can carry GBU 57 and other

204
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,199
bombs including nuclear weapons.

205
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
It has two crew members

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,319
and just think about its cost, it is 2

207
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,120
billion dollars, which means if you see it in rupees, then

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,599
each bomber costs Rs 1718000 crore.

209
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,879
Well, the bomb that is

210
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
used here, which I

211
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,960
told you about, GBU 57, why is it so special?

212
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,520
You can see its weight is 13,600 kg and

213
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
it penetrates and blasts deep underground bunkers.

214
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,720
I will also show you a little with a

215
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
picture.  You will be

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,840
able to see that this is your B2 bomber.

217
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,719
What does Bee to Bumber do?  By considerable distance I mean

218
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,719
12 Km at very high altitude.

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,839
GBU 57 drops this bomb from a height of .

220
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,000
And what happens is that this bomb in this bomber does

221
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,839
not have any engine.  But so

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
what happens is that it is dropped from such a height.

223
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
Due to gravity

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,080
it generates very high speed.

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,800
It tries to attack the target at very high speed.

226
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,959
And

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,720
through the guidance here, it

228
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,040
slightly changes its direction

229
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,360
so that a precise attack can be made.  Like the

230
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,600
nuclear plant at Fordo,

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,760
it will attack exactly where it needs to be attacked.

232
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,320
And again you can see that its casing is

233
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,320
very strong and it is at such a speed that

234
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
it first penetrates

235
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,640
very deep.  For example, the nuclear

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,800
plant located at a much lower level.  So it does

237
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,720
n't blast first.  First, it penetrates

238
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,120
deep underground

239
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,440
and then it blasts there.

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,399
Because of which

241
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,080
you will get to see exactly what it wants as its target.  So this is how the

242
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
whole thing works.  Now the question is

243
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,920
that what effect will this bombing on Iran have

244
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,760

245
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,360
on Iran's nuclear program.  This is being told, I

246
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
mean what is the current situation from intelligence sources

247
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,279
?  Many things will be known in the future as to

248
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,080
how much loss has been incurred?  What has happened?  But

249
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,680
Iran's entire nuclear program was set back at least 2 to 5 years.

250
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,760
But still keep in mind that

251
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,399
Iran has the knowledge and

252
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,399
engineering capability.  So now it depends from here

253
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,040
which path Iran

254
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,880
takes.  Will Iran

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,200
expel IAEA inspectors?  That will

256
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,120
be something to watch.  Inspectors of the International Atomic

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Energy Agency

258
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,600
are there.  So apart from this, the second thing is

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
that Iran is a member of NPT.  Keep this in mind, will

260
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
it now leave the NPT, the Non

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,079
Proliferation Treaty and at the same time will it carry out

262
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
more rapid enrichment from here, is

263
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,079
Iran not going to stop now, now it

264
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,079
depends, if you assume it does so then the

265
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,839
US says that we will again bomb.

266
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,839
Well here I would like to tell you that a

267
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,920
statement from Benjamin Netanya has also come and

268
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,640
he has said to Donald Trump and I say

269
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,399
that peace comes from strength.

270
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,040
First strength is used and

271
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,440
then peace comes.  And tonight,

272
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
Donald Trump and the United States have

273
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,160
shown tremendous strength here.  And we

274
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,320
also reported previously that the US had given

275
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,320
Israel a heads up.  We came to know about it earlier.  In

276
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
fact, let me

277
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
tell you here that there is criticism against Donald Trump in the US

278
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,000
that Donald

279
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,079
Trump is in a way

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,519
violating the Constitution.  First he should have got it

281
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,920
approved from the Congress and the Parliament

282
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,519
before going to war.  But

283
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,519
he had already declared war.  But

284
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
Donald Trump said, no, look, this was

285
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,920
necessary right now.  We couldn't do things like this before.  In

286
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,160
fact, just a short

287
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,320
while ago Donald Trump

288
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,560
also gave a press briefing here.  Meaning, here he has also

289
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,120
given a speech and said that there will be peace either

290
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,959
and there will be tragedy for Iran.

291
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,040
Meaning, he is saying that now it

292
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,160
depends on Iran if Iran will retaliate from here.  If

293
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,320
Iran retaliates against us, then

294
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,800
more tragedy will happen to Iran or

295
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
else Iran will sit quiet and everything will end at this moment.

296
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,519
No one will attack Iran.

297
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,959
Remember there are many targets

298
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
left.  Donald Trump is saying that there are

299
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,600
still many targets left.  But

300
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,320
we have attacked the most important target.

301
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,279
But if peace doesn't come quickly we will go

302
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,760
to those other targets also.

303
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,839
Donald Trump has given this clear warning.  Apart from

304
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,920
this, Donald Trump

305
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,240
also congratulated Netan Yau

306
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,440
and said that we have worked as a team

307
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,680
so that the horrible threat of

308
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
nuclear weapon on Israel has in a way ended.

309
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,560
Donald Trump spoke here for about 4 minutes.

310
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,320
Well ultimately the question is what

311
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,360
next?  Now look, everything

312
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,200
again depends on Iran.  If

313
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Iran, meaning Iran, says so, then we will

314
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
retaliate against it.  Now the US has many

315
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,360
bases in the Middle East, in Iraq,

316
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,279
Syria, Bahrain, UAE, will there be an

317
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,200
attack there?  Will Iran's

318
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,440
proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas

319
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,839
also enter the fray now?  There may be disruption in the oil market.

320
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,279
What will Donald Trump

321
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
take next?  It is possible that he may get approval from Congress

322
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,600
so that he can carry out any further strikes on

323
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,200
Iran.  So let's see

324
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,440
what happens regarding this.  But I hope that

325
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,360
you would have got to know about the news till now.

326
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
And before leaving, a very

327
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,120
interesting question: can you tell which

328
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,360
of these four

329
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,360
bombers has the names written on it?  Which

330
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,320
of these is not a part of the US Flat.   I want to

331
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,000

332
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
tell you that one of them is a Russian bomber.  And you all know its right answer.  You

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800

334
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,079
will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.  You

335
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,160
