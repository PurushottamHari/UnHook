Hello Friends.  Friends, speculations were being made about many things in the Israel-Iran war.  There were many questions whether the B2 bomber would be used?  Will America jump into this war?  Because it was being said that after two weeks, America will decide whether to attack Iran or not?  But some time ago something happened due to which Iran's entire nuclear program has gone back several years because America bombed Iran.  And you can see that US strikes three Iranian sites because the three most important nuclear sites of Iran have been attacked and in a way the US has joined this entire war. So let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly happened?  What was the B to Bumber used for?  Why is the bomb used in it so dangerous ?  What could happen next? I will tell you all that in detail.  First let us see what exactly happened?  Look, just a short while ago, Donald Trump posted on social media and confirmed that America has taken military action against Iran and attacked three Iranian nuclear sites. Can you see what is written here?  We have completed our very successful attack on the three nuclear sites in Iran.  And which are these three nuclear sites?  Well, if you look inside Iran, you will find many nuclear sites.  There are some research facilities, some nuclear power plants, some uranium mines.  But the three most important ones are Iran's entire nuclear program, under which it can make bombs, you can see that if you look below Tehran, the most important one is Fado.  Then the second one is Nathan and below that you will see Isan.  These are the three most important nuclear sites of Iran.  And if there has been devastation here, then in a way Iran's entire program has been set back by several years.  Apart from this, you can see here that Trump wrote, A full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site.  That means the primary site in all these is your Fardo.  So Donald Trump is confirming that Fado has also been attacked.  And remember, conventional weapons cannot be used on the For the. This capability is only with drones, i.e. America.  I will tell you that.  Why?  Because the stealth bomber used here and the bomb used were the only thing that could destroy Fardo.  And Israel wanted that America should help and destroy the Fado site. And you can see this here Donald Trump says that there is no other military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace.  Donald Trump is saying this.  Well, the first question that arises here is why is this Fordow so important?  And let me tell you about these three sites first. Look, if you look at this, you can see this Fordow plant and this is a mountain. This entire site, located approximately 80 to 90 meters below the mountain, has been built so that no one can attack it. And if you look at this entire site carefully, then this security check point where there is a way to go, the support building, which means that the site is below but the building that has been built outside to support it, you will see it here, the way to go to the underground complex is mentioned here, so you will get to see this entire structure and this is basically very close to Com City, this Fordo site and it is thought to be immune to conventional bombing, which means that if it has to be destroyed then only the B2 bombers that America has can destroy it because through that bomber, the 3000 pound bomb GBU 57, which means 13000 kg B bomb, which is a complete bomb, GBU 57 is called a bunker buster bomb, it can penetrate and destroy it. I will also tell you in detail how this works.  But in a way you should understand that the Fado nuclear site was targeted because highly enriched uranium was produced here. Meaning, there was enrichment at other sites as well, but it was not so high.  It is said here that more than 60% of the enrichment was done with uranium.  Well apart from this, the second one again which is very important is Nathan which you will get to see in Isan Province. This is Iran's largest uranium enrichment plant.  Where thousands of advanced centrifuges were kept.  And it has been the primary side for expanding enrichment capabilities.  And it has been attacked before also through cyber attacks etc. And the result here is that by destroying this, Iran's ability to refine uranium quickly gets destroyed.  And the third one that you will find in this great province itself, that is home to research reactor and uranium conversion plant, that too has been destroyed in a way.  Meaning, in a way you can understand that the entire supply chain that was built in the rest of the facilities will get interrupted because of this.  So these were the three biggest sites in Iran's nuclear program.  Well now the question here is how was all this done?  See here I want to tell you that the US has used stealth B-2 Spirit bombers which directly enter the enemy airspace without being detected.  That means, if you see, this entire stealth bomber B2 bomber that we are talking about, such material has been used in it that it has the capability to absorb the radar, meaning it has the capability to absorb the radar. What happens normally is that suppose the radar sends radio wave signals from here, then after colliding with the aircraft, it comes to know where it is and at what distance it is. But the kind of materials used in it are quite dangerous. And it is said in the world that it is almost impossible for you to detect it. Almost impossible with the kind of technology that exists right now.  Well here let me tell you that if you see in the Indian Ocean region, this is Diego Garcia and if you look here in the Philippines, in the Pacific region, near it, there is Guam Island.  It is told from both these places that the stealth bombers were sent towards Iran and after attacking these three sites of Iran, they came back.  Such complete planning was done and here you can see that the bomb that was used, especially in Fado, was GBU 57 Massive Ordnance Penetration. I will tell you in the next slide what this is. And here Trump says that after carrying out the bombing very comfortably, without Iran getting to know about it, these bombers did their job and came back. Well why is this important because only late last night, the news came that the US has deployed B-2 bombers in Guwahati.  Well, why is Guam important?  I was telling you that you will get to see this in the Pacific region. If you look just on the eastern side of the Philippines, there is Australia.  Japan is here. Well, this is very important historically also. This Gua Island is the same one from where the Allied Forces launched heavy attacks on Japan during World War II.  And when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Japan also, in a way, took over Guam.  Then it is obvious that Japan loses.  But the situation today is that you will find major US naval and air bases in Guam. Approximately 1/3 of Guam's area is currently occupied by the US Armed Forces. So in a way the news had come last night itself. But no one had thought that there would be bombing here so early in the morning today. So B2 bombers were deployed in Goa. Well, what is special about these B2 bombers?   The most important thing which I was telling you about is its stealth capability that it enters the enemy country and it cannot even be detected because everything fails.  The range of the entire radar system is 11,000 km.  It is said to be around. By refueling it, one can travel a very long distance.  There is a facility for mid year refueling.  Its payload is 18 tonnes.   This means you can carry bombs weighing up to 4000 pounds inside it.  And as I told you, it can carry GBU 57 and other bombs including nuclear weapons. It has two crew members and just think about its cost, it is 2 billion dollars, which means if you see it in rupees, then each bomber costs Rs 1718000 crore. Well, the bomb that is used here, which I told you about, GBU 57, why is it so special? You can see its weight is 13,600 kg and it penetrates and blasts deep underground bunkers. I will also show you a little with a picture.  You will be able to see that this is your B2 bomber. What does Bee to Bumber do?  By considerable distance I mean 12 Km at very high altitude. GBU 57 drops this bomb from a height of . And what happens is that this bomb in this bomber does not have any engine.  But so what happens is that it is dropped from such a height. Due to gravity it generates very high speed. It tries to attack the target at very high speed. And through the guidance here, it slightly changes its direction so that a precise attack can be made.  Like the nuclear plant at Fordo, it will attack exactly where it needs to be attacked. And again you can see that its casing is very strong and it is at such a speed that it first penetrates very deep.  For example, the nuclear plant located at a much lower level.  So it does n't blast first.  First, it penetrates deep underground and then it blasts there. Because of which you will get to see exactly what it wants as its target.  So this is how the whole thing works.  Now the question is that what effect will this bombing on Iran have on Iran's nuclear program.  This is being told, I mean what is the current situation from intelligence sources ?  Many things will be known in the future as to how much loss has been incurred?  What has happened?  But Iran's entire nuclear program was set back at least 2 to 5 years. But still keep in mind that Iran has the knowledge and engineering capability.  So now it depends from here which path Iran takes.  Will Iran expel IAEA inspectors?  That will be something to watch.  Inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency are there.  So apart from this, the second thing is that Iran is a member of NPT.  Keep this in mind, will it now leave the NPT, the Non Proliferation Treaty and at the same time will it carry out more rapid enrichment from here, is Iran not going to stop now, now it depends, if you assume it does so then the US says that we will again bomb. Well here I would like to tell you that a statement from Benjamin Netanya has also come and he has said to Donald Trump and I say that peace comes from strength. First strength is used and then peace comes.  And tonight, Donald Trump and the United States have shown tremendous strength here.  And we also reported previously that the US had given Israel a heads up.  We came to know about it earlier.  In fact, let me tell you here that there is criticism against Donald Trump in the US that Donald Trump is in a way violating the Constitution.  First he should have got it approved from the Congress and the Parliament before going to war.  But he had already declared war.  But Donald Trump said, no, look, this was necessary right now.  We couldn't do things like this before.  In fact, just a short while ago Donald Trump also gave a press briefing here.  Meaning, here he has also given a speech and said that there will be peace either and there will be tragedy for Iran. Meaning, he is saying that now it depends on Iran if Iran will retaliate from here.  If Iran retaliates against us, then more tragedy will happen to Iran or else Iran will sit quiet and everything will end at this moment. No one will attack Iran. Remember there are many targets left.  Donald Trump is saying that there are still many targets left.  But we have attacked the most important target. But if peace doesn't come quickly we will go to those other targets also. Donald Trump has given this clear warning.  Apart from this, Donald Trump also congratulated Netan Yau and said that we have worked as a team so that the horrible threat of nuclear weapon on Israel has in a way ended. Donald Trump spoke here for about 4 minutes. Well ultimately the question is what next?  Now look, everything again depends on Iran.  If Iran, meaning Iran, says so, then we will retaliate against it.  Now the US has many bases in the Middle East, in Iraq, Syria, Bahrain, UAE, will there be an attack there?  Will Iran's proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas also enter the fray now?  There may be disruption in the oil market. What will Donald Trump take next?  It is possible that he may get approval from Congress so that he can carry out any further strikes on Iran.  So let's see what happens regarding this.  But I hope that you would have got to know about the news till now. And before leaving, a very interesting question: can you tell which of these four bombers has the names written on it?  Which of these is not a part of the US Flat.   I want to tell you that one of them is a Russian bomber.  And you all know its right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram.
