1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,200
Hello Friends.  Friends, do you know that

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,960

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,280
Pakistan was consistently ahead of India in terms of nuclear war heads since 2010.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
This is just the last time it happened that India

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,239
marginally went ahead

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,640
of Pakistan.  But this time we have gone much

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,120
further.  This means that

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,079
officially keep in mind that this is the

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
official figure in which India has

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,719
more nuclear war heads than Pakistan.  And it

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,440
should happen.  The reason for this is that

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,600
if I tell you the numbers of our another neighbouring country, China, they will be

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,000
quite surprising.  So

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,640
we will know all this in the video, how the

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
nuclear war game is going on in India and its surrounding areas.

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,159

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
What does SIPRI report say?

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,000
I will tell you in detail what the concern is.

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,240
Let's move on.  Look,

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,439
first of all let me tell you here that India has

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,759
officially surrendered Pakistan in the number of

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,560
nuclear war heads.  And this is basically

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,560
mentioned in the SIPRI Year Book 2025.

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,119
What is Cipri?  Basically, Stockholm

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,759
International Peace Research Institute was

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,920
formed in 1966 and its

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,320
headquarters is located in Stockholm, Sweden.

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,439
Their main work is to

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,600

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,840
issue data analysis recommendations related to armed conflict.

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,479
Military Expenditure of every country: Many times

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,560
you must have heard that India exports so much to these countries.

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,399
So

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000
all such data is

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
provided here by SIPRI.  Apart from this,

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,640
information related to nuclear etc. is also given by them.

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
So, in some way or the other, India has moved ahead

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
of Pakistan

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,600
in the matter of nuclear warheads. You will see a major strategic shift in the

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,680
nuclear balance of South Asia

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,920
and the

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,640
geopolitical tensions going on here in this entire

56
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,640
region and globally, you

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
may see this getting highlighted on a large scale.  Well, the first question is that

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,120

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,280

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,319
what has been said about India's nuclear arsenal in the report received by SIPRI?  The first thing is

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,879
that the total warheads of India, that is the

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,520
total nuclear weapons that India has at present, have

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,720
reached

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,160
180, which if you look at last year in 2024, was

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,800
172.  That means we have

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,879
added eight more war heads.  And

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,599
what is the status that all these war heads are

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,640
believed to be operationally

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,120
available.  Meaning we can fire him whenever we want.

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,599
So, it

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
is operationally available.  Well, the most important thing is

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,239
that you have the nuclear

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,640
capability, but how do you deliver that nuclear

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,640
bomb.

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,120
Suppose we have to fire at someone.

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,599
So, in that case, what

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,480
methods and things do we have through which we

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,040
can do it?  Do we have a Triyard?  This

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,840
means whether we have land

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
based, air based and sea based

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,480
systems and platforms through which

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,440
we can fire it.  Yes, India

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,200
means if you look around the world, there are very few

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,599
countries that have this TRID

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,760
capability.  In which India is included

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,000
and if we

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,879
want to fire through land-based, then we can deliver it through our Agni series,

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,440
Agni One, Agni 5, Agni P which has

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,000
become prime and the upcoming Agni 6.   Apart from

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,000

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,319
this, if we look through the air base then

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,799
Jaguar which is a fighter jet becomes Mirage.

94
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,319
So all of them here have the capability to

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,400
carry out nuclear delivery.

96
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,879
Meaning, in a way, nuclear

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
missiles can be fired and any country

98
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,959
can be harmed.

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,599
Along with this, look at sea base, it is very complex

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,680
and there are very few countries which have

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,239
this capability.  So

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,760
India has IAS Arihant class

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,000
nuclear submarines V-Case series.  So

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,720
what happens here is that through this nuclear submarine,

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,040
we can fire nuclear weapons.

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,199
So India has Triyard, which

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,120
means that we have the capability through all three to

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,600
deliver nuclear weapons.

109
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,840
So India is now expanding both in

110
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
quantity and technology.  I will

111
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,360
tell you about the technology because

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
we are constantly modernizing it.  At the

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,320
same time, our emphasis is

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,639
more on the survival nuclear forces.

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
So this is about India.  On the

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,680
other hand, if we talk about Pakistan,

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,840
even last year in 2024, they had

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,160
170 nuclear war heads.  It is the same this time too.  This

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,040
means that India will have

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,960
10 more nuclear war heads than Pakistan.

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
Well,

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,160
what are their delivery capabilities?

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,759
If we talk about land based here, then they can deliver it through the Shaheen

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,680
One and Shaheen Three missiles that they have.

125
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,680
Secondly,

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,320
if we talk about air based, they have nuclear capability through their

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,800
F16 and Mirage aircraft.

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,039

129
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
And as far as sea based is concerned,

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,000

131
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,800

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,720
Pakistan currently does not have any confirmed operational sea based deterrent.  That means if you

133
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,960
look at it through C, India is far

134
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,520
ahead in that.  Indian Navy

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,520
is far ahead of Pakistani Navy.  They currently do

136
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,240
not have any such platform from where they

137
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,039
can fire nuclear weapons at anyone through sea.

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,199
So this is actually missing

139
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,520
with Pakistan.  Aldo, let me tell you here that the

140
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,759
total war head count of Pakistan has

141
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,440
not increased.  But

142
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
here it has been said in the report, which is a

143
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,560
little concerning, that Pakistan is

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,720
continuously producing fissile material

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,800
actively and at the same time is

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,720

147
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
trying to upgrade its delivery platforms.   That

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,039
means tactical nuclear weapons are

149
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
also included in this.  Well,

150
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,440
now the question here arises that how is India

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,680
modernizing things and

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,840
what is Pakistan doing there.  If we

153
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,160
talk about India then the most important thing we have is

154
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,880
Agnipe and Agni-5, basically we are

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,039
developing canisterized missiles.

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,680
Canisterised missile means that

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,680
we can take it anywhere at

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,520
any time.  So in a way, there is the

159
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
advantage of mobility and the

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,400
advantage of survivability. And suppose the enemy

161
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,960
country knows that India has

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,280
installed missiles at this particular point in this particular place,

163
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
then it will try to fire at it and

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,680
destroy it.  But if the

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,000
missiles that we have are mobile,

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,639
meaning we can carry them from one place to another easily, and

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,880
if we

168
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,000
can deliver them in a canister, then in a way

169
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,240
Agni Prime and Agni-5

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,479
can be quickly launched from anywhere here.

171
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
So this will be a technology of India.

172
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,759
Second, development.  What

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,479
is peace?  Basically multiple independently

174
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,400
targetable reentry vehicles.  What happens in this,

175
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,560
right?  It is a very simple thing, suppose

176
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,800
we are firing a missile, a ballistic

177
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,800
missile, then this ballistic missile will

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,039
go to a particular point, target

179
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
it and destroy it.  But now

180
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,160
discussions have started that what happens in the Multiple

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
Independently Targetable Re-entry

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,560
Vehicle, that

183
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,800
when this missile goes upwards and suppose it

184
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,800
starts going towards Pakistan, then

185
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,240
what will it do there, it will convert into multiple war heads.  This

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,360
means that you can target

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,759
multiple locations in Pakistan with a single rocket.

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Suppose you have to

189
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,160
target 10 locations then

190
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
you can do it with just one missile.  You do

191
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,000
n't need to fire 10 missiles.  What happens due to this is

192
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
that the entire radar and

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,160
air defence system of the enemy country gets confused.

194
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,319
Suppose if

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,240
they destroy two out of 10, then here

196
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,360
we have the capability to

197
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,680
easily target them at other places.  So

198
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
this capability is not available even with Pakistan at present.

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,120
So this becomes very

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,080
important here.  Apart from this,

201
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,879
IAS became Arihant and

202
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,720
we are trying to make your future submarines more capable.  Apart from

203
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,120
this,

204
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
India's policy has always

205
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,319
been that India's official doctrine

206
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,560
remains no earlier used.  Meaning, we have always

207
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,199
said that we will not use it unless the other person fires at us.

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,599

209
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,759
Meaning, we don’t want to do it.

210
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,319
Now Pakistan will be forced to do something.   In

211
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,240
fact it is also said that if we come to

212
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,479
know that he is about to fire.  Even if

213
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,879
he does not fire, in that case also

214
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,720
we can use nuclear weapons here.

215
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,880
Well, on the other hand, if we

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,880
talk about Pakistan, look

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,039
what Pakistan is doing?  Very cleverly, there are

218
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,000
short range nuclear missiles, I

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,240
mean some such things, meaning you are

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000

221
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,160
not directly using big nuclear weapons but

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,399
you want to use it in the battlefield

223
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,880
so that more damage can be caused, so

224
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,040
they are continuously

225
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,880
developing such missiles and because of this, the

226
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,519
danger also increases to some extent.  Then

227
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,680
apart from this, what is Pakistan doing without adding war heads this

228
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,560
year?  It is continuously

229
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,959

230
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,040
producing highly enriched uranium and platinum.  Trying to stock that up.  It

231
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,200
means that his wish is to keep

232
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600

233
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
creating as many war heads as possible in the future.

234
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,480
Then apart from this, what is his doctrine

235
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,320
?  That is the first use posture.  See

236
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
what is happening now is that if

237
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
Pakistan fights a conventional war with India then it will

238
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,399
definitely lose in that case.  He does not have that

239
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,320
capability.  And that is why

240
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,480
he continuously threatens here with nuclear weapons.  All

241
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,800
he says is that look, if we suffer

242
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,839
this loss, suppose we were just talking about water,

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,000
we have broken the Indus Water Treaty,

244
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,000
so regarding that also, he is saying that we

245
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
can fire nuclear weapons.  So

246
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,240
you will see such things with Pakistan.

247
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,480
Well, what are its regional and global

248
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,399
implications?  Look, the

249
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
dynamics within South Asia are constantly changing.

250
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,720
India has taken the number lead

251
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,959
in terms of nuclear war heads.  It

252
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
represents a symbolic and psychological

253
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,120
age.  Look, it is not that we have 10

254
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,440
more weapons, nuclear weapons.  So this is a

255
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,880
very good thing and we have

256
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,519
more power.  Look, nuclear

257
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,440
weapons are such a thing that

258
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,160
they have not been used till now,

259
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,839
except in World War 2.  So if it is ever used here

260
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,839
then it will have to be seen that

261
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,560
things get destroyed with just one or two weapons.  Then it will

262
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,480
happen further.  So the numbers are here because

263
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
if you look at the US and Russia, Russia has

264
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,279
more.  So, more

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,440
important than the numbers is to understand that these are nuclear weapons.

266
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,640
And as I was telling you,

267
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,720
Pakistan has consistently had

268
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
more nuclear weapons than India since 2010.

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
So this does not mean that Pakistan has gone far

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
ahead.  This does not

271
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,880
happen in the case of nuclear weapons.

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,120
Well it supports India's ambition also to

273
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
create a credible minimum deterrence.

274
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,880
Especially from China's perspective, which I will

275
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
tell you later.  But what is here is

276
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,959
that Pakistan has an asymmetric

277
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,279
strategy which it can use first.

278
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
Because of this there is a greater risk of escalation.

279
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,399
Now here, if we

280
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,640
talk in the global context, this is where

281
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,760
things become important,

282
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,160
you will find that China currently has more than 600 war heads.  This

283
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,640
means that the

284
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,880
stock pile that China has is

285
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
three times more than that of India and Pakistan.  Leave aside the US and Russia.  This

286
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360
means that

287
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,079
90% of the nuclear weapons in the world are

288
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,560
possessed by these two countries.  Close to 11,000 war

289
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,160
heads.  So here SIPRI has written

290
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,640
that the new global nuclear

291
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,800
arms race is becoming more and more

292
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,519
dangerous and the disarmament

293
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,240
treaties, instead of ending it, are getting more and more

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,760
excited and the countries are

295
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680

296
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,720
developing more and more nuclear weapons.  Here you

297
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,120
can see that China had 410

298
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,760
war heads last year and if you see today,

299
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
it has become 600 in one year.  There has

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,519
been an increase of 190.  are you understand?  That means

301
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,079

302
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,480
India does not have that many total nuclear war heads.  So you will see this thing here

303
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,320
and USA currently has

304
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,560
378 and Russia has 4490, they have a

305
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,959
lot.  Well, the question is

306
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,279
what warning has Sipri given?  First of all

307
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,839
it has been said that the treaty systems that were in place,

308
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,920
such as the New Star Treaty, have become weak.

309
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
Basically, the US and Russia had made a

310
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,240
treaty here that a

311
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,560
limit should be imposed on this through nuclear warhead.  If

312
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
both the countries continue producing like this

313
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,920
, there will be no

314
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,440
limit to it.  So rather than that

315
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,320
they had made a treaty to stop this.

316
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,320
But in 2023, Vladimir Putin

317
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
decided to exclude Russia from it.

318
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
So Russia has withdrawn

319
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,600
from the New Star Treaty.  So it is

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
possible that Russia may

321
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
develop more nuclear weapons here.  Then

322
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,680
apart from this, the rise of technical nuclear, as I

323
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,839
told you, Pakistan is also trying to develop short range

324
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,920
nuclear weapons.

325
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,839
This again

326
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,240
increases the risk significantly.  Then apart from this,

327
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,680
these days you are

328
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
seeing how much discussion is going on about AI, hypersonic missiles and

329
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,320
cyber threat.  So what happens here is that all of this makes

330
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,480
things more complicated.  And there is always a

331
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,279
risk of some miscalculation.

332
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,760
Suppose the terrorists get

333
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,680
some

334
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
capability by doing some cyber hacking.  So this remains a big danger.

335
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,320
So in a way, you may see India-Pakistan

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,720
border tension, India-China stand-off,

337
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,800
a nuclear flash point

338
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,720
if diplomacy fails.  Well, the

339
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,360
conclusion is that India's

340
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,279
addition of eight nuclear warheads has

341
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,600
surpassed Pakistan.  It is not

342
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,600
just numeric.  It reflects that

343
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,760

344
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,000
India is trying to do strategic evolution and modernization here.

345
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,000
But again if you look at the regional balance here,

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you will

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
see weak and fragile somewhere.  So this

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,279
was the whole video friends.  I hope that you have

349
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
now understood in detail

350
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,040
what exactly happened here and

351
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,440
before leaving, I have an interesting question: can you

352
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,760
tell me that among the countries whose names are written here,

353
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,720
which are the countries that

354
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,399
possess the nuclear triad, which means

355
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,120
that as I told you,

356
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,279
you can launch nuclear weapons through any medium, land, sea or air.

357
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720

358
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,079
You all know that its right answer will be available on my Instagram,

359
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
if you are not there, no problem, you

360
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,519
can get its correct answer from Twitter

361
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,839
