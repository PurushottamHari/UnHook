Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then what is the use of reading them again and again? I would like to thank Study IQ.  I Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study IQ supported me till Mains. Even after that he did not leave me. And I have taken this mock I study IQ. And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, do you know that Pakistan was consistently ahead of India in terms of nuclear war heads since 2010. This is just the last time it happened that India marginally went ahead of Pakistan.  But this time we have gone much further.  This means that officially keep in mind that this is the official figure in which India has more nuclear war heads than Pakistan.  And it should happen.  The reason for this is that if I tell you the numbers of our another neighbouring country, China, they will be quite surprising.  So we will know all this in the video, how the nuclear war game is going on in India and its surrounding areas. What does SIPRI report say? I will tell you in detail what the concern is. Let's move on.  Look, first of all let me tell you here that India has officially surrendered Pakistan in the number of nuclear war heads.  And this is basically mentioned in the SIPRI Year Book 2025. What is Cipri?  Basically, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute was formed in 1966 and its headquarters is located in Stockholm, Sweden. Their main work is to issue data analysis recommendations related to armed conflict. Military Expenditure of every country: Many times you must have heard that India exports so much to these countries. So all such data is provided here by SIPRI.  Apart from this, information related to nuclear etc. is also given by them. So, in some way or the other, India has moved ahead of Pakistan in the matter of nuclear warheads. You will see a major strategic shift in the nuclear balance of South Asia and the geopolitical tensions going on here in this entire region and globally, you may see this getting highlighted on a large scale.  Well, the first question is that what has been said about India's nuclear arsenal in the report received by SIPRI?  The first thing is that the total warheads of India, that is the total nuclear weapons that India has at present, have reached 180, which if you look at last year in 2024, was 172.  That means we have added eight more war heads.  And what is the status that all these war heads are believed to be operationally available.  Meaning we can fire him whenever we want. So, it is operationally available.  Well, the most important thing is that you have the nuclear capability, but how do you deliver that nuclear bomb. Suppose we have to fire at someone. So, in that case, what methods and things do we have through which we can do it?  Do we have a Triyard?  This means whether we have land based, air based and sea based systems and platforms through which we can fire it.  Yes, India means if you look around the world, there are very few countries that have this TRID capability.  In which India is included and if we want to fire through land-based, then we can deliver it through our Agni series, Agni One, Agni 5, Agni P which has become prime and the upcoming Agni 6.   Apart from this, if we look through the air base then Jaguar which is a fighter jet becomes Mirage. So all of them here have the capability to carry out nuclear delivery. Meaning, in a way, nuclear missiles can be fired and any country can be harmed. Along with this, look at sea base, it is very complex and there are very few countries which have this capability.  So India has IAS Arihant class nuclear submarines V-Case series.  So what happens here is that through this nuclear submarine, we can fire nuclear weapons. So India has Triyard, which means that we have the capability through all three to deliver nuclear weapons. So India is now expanding both in quantity and technology.  I will tell you about the technology because we are constantly modernizing it.  At the same time, our emphasis is more on the survival nuclear forces. So this is about India.  On the other hand, if we talk about Pakistan, even last year in 2024, they had 170 nuclear war heads.  It is the same this time too.  This means that India will have 10 more nuclear war heads than Pakistan. Well, what are their delivery capabilities? If we talk about land based here, then they can deliver it through the Shaheen One and Shaheen Three missiles that they have. Secondly, if we talk about air based, they have nuclear capability through their F16 and Mirage aircraft. And as far as sea based is concerned, Pakistan currently does not have any confirmed operational sea based deterrent.  That means if you look at it through C, India is far ahead in that.  Indian Navy is far ahead of Pakistani Navy.  They currently do not have any such platform from where they can fire nuclear weapons at anyone through sea. So this is actually missing with Pakistan.  Aldo, let me tell you here that the total war head count of Pakistan has not increased.  But here it has been said in the report, which is a little concerning, that Pakistan is continuously producing fissile material actively and at the same time is trying to upgrade its delivery platforms.   That means tactical nuclear weapons are also included in this.  Well, now the question here arises that how is India modernizing things and what is Pakistan doing there.  If we talk about India then the most important thing we have is Agnipe and Agni-5, basically we are developing canisterized missiles. Canisterised missile means that we can take it anywhere at any time.  So in a way, there is the advantage of mobility and the advantage of survivability. And suppose the enemy country knows that India has installed missiles at this particular point in this particular place, then it will try to fire at it and destroy it.  But if the missiles that we have are mobile, meaning we can carry them from one place to another easily, and if we can deliver them in a canister, then in a way Agni Prime and Agni-5 can be quickly launched from anywhere here. So this will be a technology of India. Second, development.  What is peace?  Basically multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles.  What happens in this, right?  It is a very simple thing, suppose we are firing a missile, a ballistic missile, then this ballistic missile will go to a particular point, target it and destroy it.  But now discussions have started that what happens in the Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle, that when this missile goes upwards and suppose it starts going towards Pakistan, then what will it do there, it will convert into multiple war heads.  This means that you can target multiple locations in Pakistan with a single rocket. Suppose you have to target 10 locations then you can do it with just one missile.  You do n't need to fire 10 missiles.  What happens due to this is that the entire radar and air defence system of the enemy country gets confused. Suppose if they destroy two out of 10, then here we have the capability to easily target them at other places.  So this capability is not available even with Pakistan at present. So this becomes very important here.  Apart from this, IAS became Arihant and we are trying to make your future submarines more capable.  Apart from this, India's policy has always been that India's official doctrine remains no earlier used.  Meaning, we have always said that we will not use it unless the other person fires at us. Meaning, we don’t want to do it. Now Pakistan will be forced to do something.   In fact it is also said that if we come to know that he is about to fire.  Even if he does not fire, in that case also we can use nuclear weapons here. Well, on the other hand, if we talk about Pakistan, look what Pakistan is doing?  Very cleverly, there are short range nuclear missiles, I mean some such things, meaning you are not directly using big nuclear weapons but you want to use it in the battlefield so that more damage can be caused, so they are continuously developing such missiles and because of this, the danger also increases to some extent.  Then apart from this, what is Pakistan doing without adding war heads this year?  It is continuously producing highly enriched uranium and platinum.  Trying to stock that up.  It means that his wish is to keep creating as many war heads as possible in the future. Then apart from this, what is his doctrine ?  That is the first use posture.  See what is happening now is that if Pakistan fights a conventional war with India then it will definitely lose in that case.  He does not have that capability.  And that is why he continuously threatens here with nuclear weapons.  All he says is that look, if we suffer this loss, suppose we were just talking about water, we have broken the Indus Water Treaty, so regarding that also, he is saying that we can fire nuclear weapons.  So you will see such things with Pakistan. Well, what are its regional and global implications?  Look, the dynamics within South Asia are constantly changing. India has taken the number lead in terms of nuclear war heads.  It represents a symbolic and psychological age.  Look, it is not that we have 10 more weapons, nuclear weapons.  So this is a very good thing and we have more power.  Look, nuclear weapons are such a thing that they have not been used till now, except in World War 2.  So if it is ever used here then it will have to be seen that things get destroyed with just one or two weapons.  Then it will happen further.  So the numbers are here because if you look at the US and Russia, Russia has more.  So, more important than the numbers is to understand that these are nuclear weapons. And as I was telling you, Pakistan has consistently had more nuclear weapons than India since 2010. So this does not mean that Pakistan has gone far ahead.  This does not happen in the case of nuclear weapons. Well it supports India's ambition also to create a credible minimum deterrence. Especially from China's perspective, which I will tell you later.  But what is here is that Pakistan has an asymmetric strategy which it can use first. Because of this there is a greater risk of escalation. Now here, if we talk in the global context, this is where things become important, you will find that China currently has more than 600 war heads.  This means that the stock pile that China has is three times more than that of India and Pakistan.  Leave aside the US and Russia.  This means that 90% of the nuclear weapons in the world are possessed by these two countries.  Close to 11,000 war heads.  So here SIPRI has written that the new global nuclear arms race is becoming more and more dangerous and the disarmament treaties, instead of ending it, are getting more and more excited and the countries are developing more and more nuclear weapons.  Here you can see that China had 410 war heads last year and if you see today, it has become 600 in one year.  There has been an increase of 190.  are you understand?  That means India does not have that many total nuclear war heads.  So you will see this thing here and USA currently has 378 and Russia has 4490, they have a lot.  Well, the question is what warning has Sipri given?  First of all it has been said that the treaty systems that were in place, such as the New Star Treaty, have become weak. Basically, the US and Russia had made a treaty here that a limit should be imposed on this through nuclear warhead.  If both the countries continue producing like this , there will be no limit to it.  So rather than that they had made a treaty to stop this. But in 2023, Vladimir Putin decided to exclude Russia from it. So Russia has withdrawn from the New Star Treaty.  So it is possible that Russia may develop more nuclear weapons here.  Then apart from this, the rise of technical nuclear, as I told you, Pakistan is also trying to develop short range nuclear weapons. This again increases the risk significantly.  Then apart from this, these days you are seeing how much discussion is going on about AI, hypersonic missiles and cyber threat.  So what happens here is that all of this makes things more complicated.  And there is always a risk of some miscalculation. Suppose the terrorists get some capability by doing some cyber hacking.  So this remains a big danger. So in a way, you may see India-Pakistan border tension, India-China stand-off, a nuclear flash point if diplomacy fails.  Well, the conclusion is that India's addition of eight nuclear warheads has surpassed Pakistan.  It is not just numeric.  It reflects that India is trying to do strategic evolution and modernization here. But again if you look at the regional balance here, you will see weak and fragile somewhere.  So this was the whole video friends.  I hope that you have now understood in detail what exactly happened here and before leaving, I have an interesting question: can you tell me that among the countries whose names are written here, which are the countries that possess the nuclear triad, which means that as I told you, you can launch nuclear weapons through any medium, land, sea or air.
