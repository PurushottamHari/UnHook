Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ and I am Varun Choudhary.  Hail India.  Vijay Mallya, who is called the King of Good Times, is so poor and innocent.  On the contrary, we should give him the money.  Why would he give us money ?  Such things started to surface continuously on social media when after 9 years a 4 hour podcast of Vijay Mallya came out. Many people started raising questions against the government.  It is also justified.  Action should definitely be taken against both the governments that were in power at that time.  In fact Vijay Mallya took the loan when he ran away. Questions arise on both the governments.  Some people started talking about how innocent Vijay Mallya is. People also raised questions about the media. On the failure of the media where a big journalist could not reach.  Even big news channels could not reach there. A podcaster reached there, an Uber reached there.  All these things are legitimate.  Ok ?  But are the claims made by Vijay Mallya in his podcast true?  Or there was a carefully planned setup to clean up his image.   Was he doing this here?  Today we are going to tell you all this in this video. And friends, the first thing is that the people of India are not as naive as we think.  She is not so naive that she does not understand that an accused or an alleged culprit, sitting in front of a camera, sitting in front of a soft-spoken interviewer, in his comfortable environment, in his comfortable place, in a different country where he does not have any insecurity , where he has been roaming around fearlessly for a long time. At such a place, and that too without asking a single hard question, no hard counter questioning is done to him. Still he should confess his crime.  He should say that yes I am a thief or I have committed such a big crime. I have run away with thousands and crores of rupees of yours.  So the people of India are not so naive that they can understand and believe that Vijay Mallya is innocent.  Well today in this video you will see every claim made by Vijay Mallya in that podcast according to the court findings, legal proceedings, legal documents and things available in public records to see how much of it is true and how much is a lie.  Who are the people at fault?  Did Vijay Mallya really not pay salary to Kingfisher employees and just said sorry?  But why was this not told in that podcast by Vijayamala that the $40 million dollars that she had sent to the accounts of her three children was also from the government, that too was a violation of the court order, it was a disobedience.  Kingfisher employees are not paid salaries but $40 million is sent to their children's accounts. Today we will tell you about it.  Was it really Arun Jaitley who was the Finance Minister at that time? Did Arun Jaitley really help Mallya or what were Mallya's relations with which leaders in both the parties, Congress and BJP ?  Who all helped him or is it just an overall blame game of Mallya.  I will tell you this also.  We will also tell you how much truth is there in Mallya's claim that he did not take even a single rupee from the bank for himself.  Is it true? Second thing, regarding Mallya's entire escape case, the exact date of it, Mallya says that it was a pre-scheduled visit of mine.  It was already decided that I have to go on this day and I had informed them before going. Did you tell me that you were going to run away or did you know that you had to appear in the Supreme Court the next day? Banks is going to go to court.  A proper seizure of your passport or taking the application.  With an application to arrest you. Didn't you know all this? Your lawyers were continuously engaged in the Supreme Court. What is the truth behind this? You will know everything today.  This video has been brought for you today after investigating all the claims in this video. Please watch it completely and share it.  Please share it as much as possible so that this video reaches as many people as possible. Secondly, it is very important to know what your point of view is.   Please do tell us in the comment section of this video what you think about this entire podcast of Mallya.  Plus what is your view point after watching this video. We have a channel on Telegram. Please join that as well. Many notifications of new videos and important information are shared with you there.  Have any conversations, any queries, come on Instagram.  We will talk there. You can join there.   Let's start today's episode.  So let the claims begin.  Before that, you should understand an overview of this entire case of Malia.  Plus you will get to know many important factors here.  See, what Mallya is saying in the podcast that I had come here after meeting Finance Minister Jaitley ji. I offered to settle with the bank.  This is n't just said in this podcast.  If you assume that you are continuously following this case, this is a case of money laundering, this is a case of fraud, this entire case of taking fake loan , overall it is not just a case of him running away.  The case started from there.  The money that we have to recover is for the fake loans that he had taken.  This is his statement, he repeats it continuously. Not only in this podcast, but also in 2018, 2020, whenever he appeared in court in London , his statement is recorded after coming out of the court. I met the Finance Minister before I left repeated my offer to settle with the banks.  So he has consistently made this a statement of his which he says every time in front of the media.  Now the main thing to understand is, what exactly is this case ?  Look, the case is not that he ran away from here.  Before that he had taken fake loans.  In the case of India, there are three different factors which clearly explain Malia's dishonesty here.  Let us expose its fakeness.  The first is misrepresentation by various banks to acquire loans.  To take the loan, he formed a consortium of 17 different banks in which SBI AD was leading that consortium. He has misrepresented all his documents to the company.  Its profitability has been misrepresented and on that basis he has taken loans.  After that, after taking the loan, he got the amount of misuse of the loan, he said that I never took a single penny of the loan, whatever amount came from the bank, he has misused it.  We will tell you its proofs further here.  The third thing is that after taking the loan and misusing it, when it comes to repaying the loan, the banks ask you to repay the loan. So his conduct till now, for years, means that he ran away from here, in a way he dodged the entire legal proceedings and ran away from here to India, so these are three different cases filed against him by India, but Mallya never talks about these, you must have always noticed that there are only two- three things that he keeps on telling and after that, the claims that he has made, those too are going to be broken out here today, we are going to expose them. Well it is true that whenever Mallya's case comes up, whether it is Congress or BJP, both the parties keep blaming each other.  One says that he should get the loan on your time.  The other one says that he ran away during your time.  But it is a fact and it is true that both the parties have helped Malia at various stages of her success or crisis. These things are visible from somewhere or the other. You can see it from his entry into Rajya Sabha. He became a Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka in 2002. At that time, he was made an MP with the support of Congress and JDS. After that, when he became MP again in 2010, he had the support of BJP and JDS and became MP.  The way he explained in the podcast why he was kept in politics and that he used to think that whenever the time of elections comes, I should go somewhere out of India.  This is because from what he told me I was basically used for funds.  Look, here are three things he said.  First, liquor means liquor , funds means money and vehicles, cars, vehicles.  We all know to what extent money, liquor and vehicles are used in the Indian elections in our country.  To what extent are they needed? So, it's no big deal.  And this is not something that no one would know about and perhaps Mallya is being used for this reason. Constantly utilizing its resources. Well, the second thing will be discussed here today in a very uncensored manner. You will be informed about what is happening.  What things have happened.  It will be told the way it happened.  Well, know a little about Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines. Started in 2005.  Ok ?  After starting in 2005, there was a hurry to expand as quickly as possible. Due to that expansion, within just 4 years from 2009, this Kingfisher Airlines was running in losses. Its whole structure was ruined.  Things were going badly in Los Angeles. Despite this, a loan of Rs 7000 crore has been given to the consortium of 17 banks in which SBI was at the top. SBI was leading that consortium at that time and it was given loans worth more than Rs. 7,000 crore from 17 banks. You gave such a huge loan to a loss making company. Is this possible without any political pressure or support from any political collusion?  You can tell it yourself in the comment section.  Ok? Because most of the banks were government owned.  Let me also tell you that out of all the 17 banks, many were government banks.  Well the second thing in this is that he is in a kind of political collusion with Mallya and who are those specific people who have been continuously supporting him.  Proper investigation will be possible only when he is brought here. Explanation will be given.  And who knows, maybe the acceleration is being continuously postponed because there are many well-known people involved in this entire scam whose names, if revealed, would create problems for them. Well another very strange thing was that on the same day when the banks talked about seizing Mallya's passport for his arrest in the Depth Recovery Tribunal in DRT, he left the country.  That means, you see, a notice has been issued by the Supreme Court that the next hearing is on this day.  Banks is going to seize his passport.  But he flees the country. Where did this prescheduled visit come from? This was a properly planned visit, such that you are thinking of fleeing the country on this day.  I am thinking of doing the entire legal proceedings and all the legal matters. Well, Vijay Mallya got his first loan in 2004.  After this it was received in 2008.  Despite declaring all the assets of his companies as non-performing assets, the entire loan structure was restructured in 2010.  The entire loan was restructured. This is a big thing even though it was declared an NPA in 2010.  From here also, political connections come to the fore. Now both the parties have been continuously blaming each other. But a very big allegation has been made by Sambit Patra, who is the spokesperson of BJP. He had imposed it.  He said that during the time of Congress he had applied it by name.  So it becomes more important to mention it here because you are making allegations on someone by name and if the opposite party is countering it then what is it saying and if it is not countering it because here the counter was not done in that manner, then why does it become necessary to tell this statement. Samit Patra had said that during the Congress regime from 2004 to 2014, the finance minister got the No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Malia by putting pressure on the State Bank of India and the bank officials got the United Breweries which was Malia's company, Malia's father had started it with soil Himalaya. United Bureau had asked the officials of the bank to meet him.  He was ordered that he has to go and meet him. According to Samit Patra, bailout package was given to Kingfisher Reliance on the advice of Manmohan Singh.  In fact, at that time the Income Tax Department was also pressured to unfreeze Mallya's accounts. Therefore the Income Tax Department also showed leniency there.  All these things have been said.  All these things come to light.  So you see that political collusion is definitely there in this case. Well, both the parties were involved. No doubt about it.  Both parties were involved.  But Mallya's defence is probably continuing till now because a very big political nexus is involved in it.  Well overall, the process of expressing Mallya's case is continuously going on in London. One of his dramas happened suddenly.  This is from 2020. An extra drama took place in a UK court at the Westminister Magistrates Court. Basically the point there was that you can talk about anything on the podcast. Give any statement to the media outside. Speaking of Malia.  But in the court, your lawyers are representing you. If they have nothing left to say then it means you are a puppet.  You have done those things.  The lawyer in front of you is completely accusing you of doing wrong things.  What happened here was that the hearing of Mallya's exemption appeal was going on in the West Indies Magistrate Court in London. The lawyer representing India was Mark Summers and the lawyer representing Mallya was Claire Mattcom. There was a continuous heated debate. Officers of CBI, ED, Indian High Commission were also present there. Everyone had gone to say something on behalf of Mallya. The Indian lawyer Mark Summers said that the loan that Mallya and Kingfisher had taken from IDBI Bank and SBI in 2009 was taken through false profitable projections.  Misrepresented his company's profitable projections. Showed fake profitable projections. Secondly, the company's profits and losses were not disclosed to the banks.  Neither IDB nor SBI, which was a consortium of 17 banks, was informed. Here it has been completely proved dishonest. But on the other hand when it was Mallya's lawyer's turn, no statement came on what he said. What was his statement on that Mallya could not repay the loan my lord because at that time it was a genuine business failure, he really suffered losses, his company's aviation industry was facing a lot of challenges in India at that time, that's why he could not repay the loan brother what is the case, the case is that you presented fake documents, your fake company 's projection in front of the banks and the main point that comes up here is that if a fake projection has been made in front of the bank and if the bank has checked and verified it properly, then what question arises here that was it because of pressure from one very big minister or several very big ministers and there was pressure from both the parties, there was pressure, that's why the banks acted in this manner.  Well, this case was completely about a fake loan. Meaning that Mallya has taken fake loans. Well, now we have discussed all these factors directly.  Now let us come to the claims made by Mallya in this podcast.  These claims that he has made, at least seven to eight claims, will now be exposed.

The loans were for King Fisher. This is the first claim.  Mallya is saying that he never took a single penny, a single rupee from the bank.  I did not take any such loan for myself.  He took a loan.  Kfisher Airlines has taken a loan. He says he was just a guarantor.  Ok ?  He also said that the depth figure of ₹9000 crores is clearly written in the certificate of the Depth Recovery Tribunal (DRT) that the depth figure is 6203 crores, so where did this figure of ₹9000 crores come from, this is basically what the Himalayas are saying.  He has said that this depth figure of Rs 6203 crore is written in DRT.  Plus including 11.5% interest on that. Basically he is saying how responsible I am.  They have even shown my depth figure incorrectly and secondly, I have not taken a single penny.  Now technically yes, the loan was taken for Kingfisher Airlines. But who was the guarantor? Who is Vijay Mallya legally responsible?  Vijay Mallya.  Is it too difficult to understand the meaning of such a small thing?  The guarantor is Vijay Mallya.  Vijay Mallya is legally bound. Who will repay if the airline defaults ?  Vijay Mallya.  Which is in writing, which is the documentation, still if such a thing comes to light, in order to show yourself as innocent, in order to show yourself as innocent, you are becoming an object of ridicule. Well, the Supreme Court of India, the CBI, the ED have clearly said that Mallya is accountable for the entire depth because he was the guarantor and this figure of Rs 9,000 crores is basically the total of the overall principal and the interest, which has continuously increased with time.  You have been continuously conducting this event for so long, in a way, you have been a fugitive for years. You have run away from here.  So this constant figure is bigger.  The DRT figure of ₹6203 crores is just a base amount. But as the interest of penalties has been continuously imposed on you over time, this figure has reached this level.  Well, other than that, leave this figure alone.  I say, if you are saying that you did not take a single penny, then what about that ₹900 crore loan that you got from IDBI Bank? You used that money to buy properties and to rent your properties abroad and to acquire different assets. Meaning if the money had to be paid, it was taken by Kingfer Airlines.  If I want to blow money then I will blow it.  Vijay Mallya will fly him.   It is ridiculous but equally serious because such claims are being made. So anyway, ₹900 crores, it's official. CBI is an alliance of ED.  It has been clearly established that Mallya diverted ₹900 crore from the loan taken from IDBI Bank which was used to buy properties abroad. Properties used for renting. And this show happened, it came to light here that it has spun off all the funds; our Indian authorities have evidence of this, so this narrative that I was just a guarantor, I did not do anything, this will not work here and is not going to work here, being a guarantor means that it is your legal responsibility, you will have to own that responsibility and plus the proofs of diversion of funds that are coming out, your personal involvement is clearly visible here.  Second claim of Vijay Mallya is that I had told Arun Jaitley before leaving India in 2016, I had informed him about this and it was already my trip, it was a pre-scheduled trip. Mallya basically said that he had told the then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley inside the Parliament about his London Geneva trip. 1 minute.  But did you say that I am going to run away.  I am about to be declared a fugitive.  If I leave from here now, I will not come back. Now dispose of all the money you have because I am about to leave.  Did you come out saying this ?  Here you told him about the London Geneva trip, the official statements are out. You said that Vijay Mallya said that he had also requested that I had requested here to do the settlement with the bank.  On which figures did you ever tell that on which figures you were not willing to give even half of your total amount of ₹9000 crore, how will the banks agree, most of them are public sector banks, whom are you making mad, whom are you fooling continuously, well Vijay Mallya said this very clearly in the podcast that I had gone to meet Arun Jaitley, at first he refused to accept it but later when a Congress MP saw it there, he countered that yes, I had seen Arun Jaitley meeting Vijay Mallya.  Later Arun Jaitley said that yes a fleeting meeting had taken place.  Meaning, a meeting took place suddenly in the morning. Where Mallya had said that yes he is going.  He is going somewhere.  Mallya is basically saying that I had openly said that I am leaving.  And secondly, there is nothing to hide in this. This was my prescheduled visit. I had to go through this.  Everyone already knew about this.  The first thing you did n't tell anyone was that you were going to run away.  Secondly, Arun Jaitley had clarified this in 2018. He said this when it came to light that it was a member of the Parliament who had seen Mallya meeting Jaitley.  After he spoke, Arun Jaitley's statement came out in which he said that yes a brief meeting was held.  There was a small meeting with Malia in the Parliament.  Where Malia said that he wants to settle something with the banks.  But continuously, because this is a process, a detailed meeting should have been held on this.  Did Mallya properly go for a proper appointment to have a meeting with Jaitley and other bank authorities before fleeing India? Later, the claims that are coming out are that I told the chief of SBI, even the head in Hyderabad that let's have a meeting, I am ready to pay the money. What did you do during your time in India?  Well, this political nexus is clearly visible here.  There is no denying that no politician or many politicians did not help Mallya to escape.  Because Mallya left India on 2 March 2016.  He has run away from here.  Just a day later, Banks pleaded in the Supreme Court for his arrest and seizure of his passport.  A plea was filed.  Plus CBI arrested him in October 2015, see this he ran away in 2016.  In October 2015, that is almost 6-seven months ago, a lookout notice was issued against Mallya saying that this person will not be allowed to escape from India. He did not run away from India.  Because of this, a lookout notice would be issued on it which was a block notice.  That means it will be completely blocked.  Will be stopped from fleeing from India.  But just after a month, in November 2015, this lookout notice was changed to report notice.  The CBI said at that time that there was a technical mistake.  This is visible due to a technical glitch. Sometimes typing errors occur in what is written.  But there is no second opinion on this or in one way you can look at it that no second thought ever comes to mind that this would not have been done intentionally or it would not have been done under someone's pressure. Because Subramaniam Swamy, who himself is a great leader, is a politician.  He himself said this along with many senior Congress leaders who alleged here that all these things were done deliberately.  It is a fact that both parties continuously accuse each other in the Mallya case. Malia's diplomatic passport was not confiscated.  While the person had committed such a huge fraud, he still had his diplomatic passport with him inside the country. His sudden departure does not indicate that his visit was a pre-scheduled one. This was just a proper planning by Mallya to flee from India. He will run away on this day and at this time.  He was also aware about the notice.  Was aware of everything. He was also aware of the changes made by the CBI.  And there were all these things.  Basically that's why Malia ran away from here.  Well, there is a political nexus behind this.  No one can deny this. Malia also says the same thing over and over again, so he's just making this thing his issue. A power is creating its own.  He is making a statement power statement so that he can prove himself innocent. But he never talks about how wrong he had shown his company's profit projections to the banks while taking loans.  This is his next statement.  Third statement is that I am not a thief.  Went on a prescheduled visit and did not return.  Because of some valid reasons. Malia says basically he is not a thief.  He has not fled from India. He says that he is just left.  I just left.  I had a visit already scheduled in March 2016, I went here as per that and I am not coming back because unfair trials will be conducted against me.   The bad detention conditions in India are not hidden from anyone.  A UK court sides with the UK court here. So its statement of the UK court shows that the conditions of Indian detention valorize the European Convention of Human Rights, ECHR, that is, it even brings the ECHR to the fore.  He said that the UK court believes that the detention conditions in India are worst and useless.  Do you know who used the same thing ?  This same statement, the person whom we have dragged and brought recently, Tabur Rana, who will be called a terrorist of 261, had helped David Comman Haley, had killed 177 innocent people, here in India, these 10 terrorists of Lashkar-e-Taba had helped him, that Rana, whom we have dragged from UK, had given the same statement here, for not being explored in India, he had also said the same thing in the court in UK that the detention conditions there are very bad, I will be tortured even more there.  I cannot go to India. Under the UARC United, this European EHRC European Convention on Human Rights, the UK court should deny sending me to India.  They repeat the same things continuously.  Will commit crime from India. Will commit crime in India.  They will go out and argue as if they are completely innocent.  Well, the Himalayas did the same thing here also.  But now look at this argument of AHRC, the US court had approved the extradition in 2020 itself.  It is almost approved.  Just telling here that this is a confidential matter.  It is a confidential legal matter due to which it is being delayed. Now what is this legal confidential matter ?  Who knows, the issue may not arise against governments or any specific individuals. Because of this, this legal matter is coming to the fore.  The UK court did not mention any such detention conditions in Malia's case.  What Malia is saying, here he is giving a statement of ECHR, he is giving his argument, he is giving this after looking at other cases, his lawyer has told him that such things are said in other cases, before sending him to India, you have to say this in the expulsion in front of everyone, this is what he is doing.  The next claim of Manaliya is that I have apologised to the Kingfisher employees but could not pay their salaries because the court and the bank have put a lot of restrictions on me and that is why I only apologised to them and could not pay their salaries.  Let us expose this once and for all in depth.  Let me tell you. Mallya says that I was not able to pay the salaries to the Kingfisher employees. Why couldn't you give it?  Because there are restrictions imposed by the court and the bank regarding the transfer of assets to the transferors of assets.  He can't make much money selling things from here to there. Basically, these are Vijay Mallya 's employees who have not been paid their salaries. He made the excuse that Karnataka High Court and banks have imposed a ban.  He is prohibited from transferring or disposing of his movable and immovable properties and assets.  Has been done If you do this, it will be a violation of the court. But then why did Mallya secretly transfer $40 million to the accounts of his three children in 2016? Why did you send them to the three children by creating one trust for all three?  This 40 million dollars was in 2016 from a company named Diag Dugue PLC which is a British alcoholic company.  A payment came from there.  There might be some old payment.  The 40 million dollars that came into Mallia's accounts in 2016, just convert it and see how much it is in Indian rupees, not once but many times, the salaries of all the employees are paid, what did Mallia do with the 40 million in this? Malia secretly sent it to her Edmund D Rawchild Swiss Bank, Switzerland. This account of hers was not told to the authorities, Mallia sent it to an account in Edmund D Rawchild Swiss Bank, Switzerland.  This $million was never told this. What did he do with this money?  His three children are Siddharth and Siddharth Mallya from his first wife and Tina and Leena Mallya from his second wife.  It was transferred as a gift deeds to the accounts of both of them. If you calculate 40 million, look at the current price of dollar or even see by the price at that time, how much it would be by applying an average.  This entire money was transferred into the three trusts. When the Supreme Court came to know about this during investigation, the Supreme Court asked Mallya to return the entire money within four weeks. He didn't.  This money was given by Mallya to his unpaid employees, from whom he made them work, from whom he took hard work, and on whose hard work and sweat, this extravagance, this lavish lifestyle of Mallya was being run; this money was not given to those employees in India because it is not on priority.  The priority is family, children and especially one's own money.  No matter how much fraud you commit, at the end it is the same thing that if it has to fly then Mallya will fly it and if it has to be repaid then Kingfisher Airlines had taken the loan, brother.  Yes, Mallya's next claim is that the collapse of Kingfisher has happened due to political pressure and bureaucracy.  Look, the first thing is that the political pressure which you are saying is the reason behind the collapse of Kingfisher. Whatever your rise has been, these politicians and this political system have had a major role in it.  It belonged to these bureaucrats.  The way you have risen consistently, the things that you have done with RCB, the F1 race team, all this was due to them somewhere or the other.  The facilities that you got, the loan of Rs. 7000 crore that you got from 17 consortium banks, all this was because of this bureaucracy and these politicians. He had a hand in it somewhere at that time also.  What you said, the collapse of Kingfisher happened because of these people. He also had a hand in lifting it. Don't forget this. Mallya directly blamed the UPA government.  Especially to the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee.  He said that Pranab Mukherjee displeased me when I told him that I wanted to downsize Kingfisher.  Kingfisher is running in loss.  There are many things. He had refused at that time.  The second thing he said was that the delay happened because of the FDI rules. One of my very good dealings was the Etihad Airways deal, which was a potential deal, which got delayed because of the FDI rules because of which my airline collapsed.   The reality is that 2008 was no doubt a tough time not just for Kingfisher but for the overall Indian aviation industry.   There was a financial crisis.  Regulatory hurdles were being seen in the aviation industry.  It is not just Kingfisher that is being seen at that time, other airlines which are working well today were also there at that time.  If we talk about the case of Kingfisher and Mallya, Kingfisher was hurt. We can understand from this, no doubt, but Mallya's own decisions, which included an aggressive expansion of about 5 years to fly internationally. After forming Kingfisher Airlines, he acquired Air Deccan, merged it, and bought it within himself. In a way, it takes 5 years. You have to run it for 5 years until you cannot travel abroad, cannot do foreign operations, cannot send your flights out of India. But Air Deccan was merged, it was a heavy debt company at that time. Air Deccan was also merged at that time. The lavish lifestyle was continued. All these were also the reasons for the sinking of Kingfisher. Why are these being hidden? What Mallya said in a podcast was that he invited Enri Keglesias on his birthday. No problem. He bought the team. No problem. He bought the racing team. No problem. This doesn't matter to me.  If it did not cost money, then it could have been invested in the company there too, I could have created a separate fund for the salaries of the employees, so that if there is ever a crisis or any problem in the company, at least my employees get their salaries on time, I could have created such a fund or not, so these are many things.  Look, it's a matter of destiny.  The intentions are bad.  Isn't it?  Second thing, let us talk about the Etihad deal.  Mallya is saying that the failure of the Etihad deal happened because of FDI rules.  But basically it comes to light that Kingfisher was in such a big financial mess at that time.  There was such a huge financial mess that no investor or any big company could even think of merging it.  Did not want to touch Kingfisher without a major restructuring.  Unless they restructure their entire structure.  The old people, who have become useless in a way, were removed and a separate structure was created according to the other investors. Until that time, the Etihad deal was not because of FDI rules, it was the structure for Mallya's own Kingfisher, it was spoiled due to mismanagement. The next claim of Mallya is that I had given settlement offers to the banks but they refused and did not accept it. Mallya says that he gave four settlement offers between 2012 and 2015 and in fact, one of them was such that this offer was given to the chairperson of SBI in Hyderabad. But he demanded Rs 14,000 crore instead of the principal amount.   The first thing in this is that whatever offers were made by Mallya, it has been clearly stated here officially that he was offering the principal amount only for the principal amount.  Any penalties that are imposed on him, any interest that is charged, he does not have to pay it. These offers were given by Mallya after cutting a huge amount and according to his own conditions. All the offers were condition based.  I wanted to get the work done on my conditions.  I did not want to take full liability for anything.  Therefore these offers were not accepted. This is such a huge massive cut, public funds are involved in it.  The 17 consortium banks were mostly government banks.  First thing is that there are many public sector banks.  Second thing is that public funds are involved in this.  Any bank taking such a big cut assumed all the liabilities including interest on itself, so why would it pay for all the extravagances that the bank indulged in ?  They would want that they should get the full amount which is due.   By imposing penalties and interest.  This is not what Malia was wanting.  Every offer he gave to Kandi was conditional. He never took full liability.  The court documents even say that the offers were inadequate.  For this reason it was not taken.  And after this tell me that you have given this offer continuously for years after a long time.  For years you did not cooperate with the Indian authorities , with the Indian judicial system, in fact, you invited the judicial system and ran away.  Why are you called a fugitive ?  This is the reason why it is called so.  You ran away from here.  You are not willing to take the legal procedure at that time, it is a good option that was given to you.  But when you ran away from here and got arrested, you were declared a fugitive, that this person is a fugitive.  He has fled from India, he is a fugitive.  Once this tag has been applied, you will be dealt with only through proper legal procedure. Extradition will be done for you.  After that there will be a proper legal trial.  Only then will you be dealt with. Why would India deal with a thief or a fugitive ?   It is a very big thing.  It does not depend on you like this, India never did.   The next claim is I want to come back to India if there is a fair trial.  Mallya says he is willing to return to India if fair trial is assured.  He has said that detention conditions are the same thing. Nonsense over and over again.  My detention conditions should not be political targeting.  I have been made a football. This is his statement.  You can think about it.  I mean, how can any person give so much to himself?  And that too when at one time it is true that politicians had supported him. Helped him to escape.  So at one time it is also true that the same politicians and the same bureaucrats were behind the entire success that Kingfisher got.  It was because of him that so much resourcefulness was coming into this whole organization, this whole company.  Well the point is that if Mallya was serious about coming back to India, he would have engaged with the Indian authorities , with the ministries, there are so many agencies like ED, CBI, Finance Ministry and their officials.  I would approach him. After 9 years I wouldn't suddenly appear on a 4 hour podcast and sit down for a soft spoken interview. There, one does not give his explanation by declaring himself innocent.  If I want to come to India completely. But the reality is that the CBI, ED, Supreme Court of India, Supreme Court rulings, contempt charges have been continuously imposed on him for so many years.   This clearly shows that there are cases of serious fraud and money laundering against him.  There are serious charges.  And this is clear evidence that because of this, he doesn't want to come here. We have told you the argument regarding the detention conditions; the UK court has said similar things in other cases.  Nothing like this has ever been said in this specific case of Mallya.  And what Mallya has said overall is that I want to come to India if I am given a fair trial. This is just a publicity stunt to clean up one's image. Basically a maximum picture, if you look at it in the big picture, if you look at it in the big picture, then the overall picture of Malia, many people are seeing it this way on Twitter, on social media, that it was a PR game.  One such PR game where a podcast of Mallya was aired.  It was a planned move by Mallya to reshape his own image.  And people on Twitter are also saying that a tough podcaster was chosen over a tough journalist.  Meaning that if a tough journalist had been there in front of him, Mallya would not have been able to last even for 5 minutes. This entire podcast was aired in a controlled environment without any hard questions and it was clear that Mallya had done all these things intentionally.  The court, the Supreme Court of India, has repeatedly said that Mallya diverted the funds. Left his employees alone.  Left them unpaid. Salary was not paid and the creditors were continuously avoided. Sirius, there are charges against him.  There are cases of money laundering. Blaming it on political pressure and bureaucracy.  No doubt these people would have been involved with Mallya till the time he was here and he ran away from here.  There is nothing big in this. It can be possible.  Who knows, these things may also come out in further investigation. But this blame game of Mallya is a perfect way to divert attention from her mismanagement. Proven.  So this was today 's video.  You all must have seen the podcast of Vijay Mala.  It is very viral all over India.  Many things are being said about him in it.  Some people are calling him innocent.
