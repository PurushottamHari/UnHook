00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,760
Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,840
and I am Varun Choudhary.  Hail

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,759
India.  Vijay Mallya, who is called the King of Good Times, is

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,000
so poor and innocent.  On the contrary,

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,240
we should give him the money.  Why would he give us money

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,960
?  Such things started to surface continuously

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,160
on social media when after 9 years

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,880
a 4 hour podcast of Vijay Mallya came out.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,039
Many people started raising questions

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,880
against the government.  It is also justified.  Action should definitely be taken

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,480
against both the governments that were in power at that time.  In

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,559
fact Vijay Mallya

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,960
took the loan when he ran away.

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,800
Questions arise on both the governments.  Some people

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,960
started talking about how innocent Vijay Mallya is.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,200
People also raised questions about the media.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
On the failure of the media where a big

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
journalist could not reach.  Even

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,600
big news channels could not reach there.

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
A podcaster reached there, an Uber

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,559
reached there.  All these things are legitimate.  Ok

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,960
?  But are the claims made by Vijay Mallya

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,399
in his podcast

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,120
true?  Or there was a carefully planned

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,680
setup to clean up his image.   Was

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,439
he doing this here?  Today we are going to

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
tell you all this in this video.

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,119
And friends, the first thing is that the

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,200
people of India are not as naive as we

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
think.  She is not so naive

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,960
that she does not understand that an accused or an

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,119
alleged culprit, sitting in front of a camera,

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
sitting in front of a soft-spoken interviewer,

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,640
in his comfortable environment,

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,560
in his comfortable place, in a different country

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,759
where he does not have any insecurity

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,400
, where he has been roaming around fearlessly for a long time.

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,200
At such a place, and that too without asking a single

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,040
hard question, no

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
hard counter questioning is done to him.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,079
Still he should

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,640
confess his crime.  He should say that yes

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,880
I am a thief or I have committed such a big crime.

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,360
I have run away with thousands and crores of rupees of

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,000
yours.  So the

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,000
people of India are not so naive that they can understand and

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,640
believe that Vijay Mallya is innocent.  Well today

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,240
in this video you will see every claim made by Vijay Mallya

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,119
in that podcast according to the

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,479
court findings, legal proceedings,

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,319
legal documents and

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
things available in public records to see

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,440

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,000
how much of it is true and how much is a lie.  Who are the

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000
people at fault?  Did

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
Vijay Mallya really not pay salary to Kingfisher employees

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,440
and just said sorry?  But

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,920
why was this not told in that podcast

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,760
by Vijayamala that the $40 million

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
dollars that she had sent to the accounts of her three children was

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,720
also from the government, that too was a

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,840
violation of the court order, it was a

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,000
disobedience.  Kingfisher employees are

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
not paid salaries but $40 million is

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,239
sent to their children's accounts.

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,360
Today we will tell you about it.  Was it really

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,760
Arun Jaitley who was the Finance Minister at that time?

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,920
Did Arun Jaitley really help

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,680
Mallya or what were Mallya's relations with which leaders

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
in both the parties, Congress and BJP

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
?  Who all

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,400
helped him or is it just an overall

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
blame game of Mallya.  I will tell you this also.  We will

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,959
also tell you how much

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,440
truth is there in Mallya's claim that he did

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,280
not take even a single rupee from the bank for himself.  Is

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,400
it true?

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,680
Second thing, regarding Mallya's entire escape case, the

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,440
exact date of it, Mallya

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,440
says that it was a pre-scheduled

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,239
visit of mine.  It was already decided that I have to

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,959
go on this day and I had informed them before going.

85
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,000
Did you tell me that you were going to run away

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,640
or did you know that you had to appear in the Supreme Court the next day?

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,120
Banks is going to go to

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,360
court.  A proper

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,080
seizure of your passport or

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
taking the application.  With an application to arrest you.

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
Didn't you know all this?

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
Your lawyers were continuously engaged in the Supreme Court.

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,560
What is the truth behind this?

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
You will know everything today.  This

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,720

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,680

113
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,280
start today's episode.  So let the

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,360
claims begin.  Before that,

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
you should understand an overview of this entire

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
case of Malia.  Plus

117
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
you will get to know many important factors here.  See, what

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
Mallya is saying in the podcast

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
that I had come here after meeting Finance Minister Jaitley ji.

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
I offered to

121
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
settle with the bank.  This is

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
n't just said in this podcast.  If

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
you assume that you are continuously following this case, this is a

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
case of money laundering, this

125
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,479
is a case of fraud, this entire case of taking fake loan

126
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,560
, overall it is

127
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,160
not just a case of him running away.  The case started from there.  The

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
money that we have to recover is for the

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,040
fake loans that he had taken.  This

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,840
is his statement, he repeats it continuously.

131
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,560
Not only in this podcast, but also in

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,479
2018, 2020, whenever he appeared in court in London

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
, his statement is recorded after coming out of the court.

134
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,000
I met the Finance

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,880
Minister before I left repeated my offer

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,880
to settle with the banks.  So he has consistently

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,680
made this a statement of his which

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,600
he says every time in front of the media.  Now the main

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
thing to understand is, what exactly is this case

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,400
?  Look, the case is not that he ran away

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,199
from here.  Before that he had taken fake loans.  In the

142
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,039
case of India, there are three

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
different factors which

144
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,520
clearly explain Malia's dishonesty here.  Let us

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,800
expose its fakeness.  The first is

146
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,680
misrepresentation by various banks to

147
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,680
acquire loans.  To take the loan, he formed a

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,880
consortium of 17 different banks in which

149
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,600
SBI AD was leading that consortium.

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,919
He has misrepresented

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,080
all his documents to the company.  Its

152
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,880
profitability has been misrepresented and

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,240
on that basis he has taken loans.  After that,

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,479
after taking the loan, he

155
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,199
got the amount of misuse of the loan, he said that I

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,080
never took a single penny of the loan, whatever

157
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,759
amount came from the bank, he has misused it.  We will

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,639
tell you its proofs further

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,520
here.  The third thing is that after taking the loan and

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,440
misusing it, when it

161
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,520
comes to repaying the loan, the banks ask you to repay the loan.

162
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,319
So his conduct till

163
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,360
now, for years, means that he ran away

164
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,759
from here, in a way he dodged the entire legal proceedings and ran away from

165
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,160
here to

166
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,400
India, so these are three different cases

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
filed against him by India,

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
but Mallya never talks about these,

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
you must have always noticed that there are only two-

170
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,919
three things that he keeps on telling and

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
after that, the claims that he has made, those too are going to be

172
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,240
broken out here today, we are going to expose them.

173
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,479
Well it is true that

174
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,840
whenever Mallya's case comes up, whether it is Congress or BJP, both the parties

176
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,720

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,120
keep blaming each other.  One says that

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,680
he should get the loan on your time.  The other one says

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,599
that he ran away during your time.  But it

180
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,520
is a fact and it is true that both the

181
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
parties have helped Malia at various stages of

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,840
her success or crisis.

183
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,759
These things are visible from somewhere or the other.

184
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,440
You can

185
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,360
see it from his entry into Rajya Sabha.

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,280
He became a Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka in 2002.

187
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,520
At that time,

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,360
he was made an MP with the support of Congress and JDS.

189
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,840
After that, when he

190
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,120
became MP again in 2010, he had the support of BJP and JDS and

191
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,639
became MP.  The way he

192
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,720
explained in the podcast why he was

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,720
kept in politics and that he used to think

194
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,120
that whenever the time of elections comes, I should

195
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,639
go somewhere out of India.  This is because from

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,800
what he told me I was basically

197
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,199
used for funds.  Look, here are

198
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,720
three things he said.  First, liquor means liquor

199
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,759
, funds means money and

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,919
vehicles, cars, vehicles.  We all know to

201
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,639

202
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,400
what extent money, liquor and vehicles are

203
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
used in the Indian elections in our country.  To what extent are they needed?

204
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
So, it's no big deal.  And

205
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
this is not something that

206
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,840
no one would know about and perhaps Mallya is being used for this reason.

207
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,000
Constantly utilizing its resources.

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,680
Well, the second thing will be

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,280
discussed here today in a very uncensored manner.

210
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
You will be informed about what is

211
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,919
happening.  What things have happened.  It will be

212
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,080
told the way it happened.  Well, know a little

213
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,000
about Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines.

214
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,919
Started in 2005.  Ok

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,440
?  After starting in 2005, there was

216
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,840
a hurry to expand as quickly as possible.

217
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,720

218
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,360
Due to that expansion, within just 4 years from 2009,

219
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,000
this Kingfisher Airlines was running in losses.

220
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,399
Its whole structure was

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
ruined.  Things were going badly in Los Angeles.

222
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,760
Despite this, a

223
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,599
loan of Rs 7000 crore has been

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
given to the consortium of 17 banks in which SBI was at the top.

225
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,000
SBI was leading

226
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,839
that consortium at that time and

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,200
it was given loans worth more than Rs. 7,000 crore from 17 banks.

228
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,080
You gave such a huge loan to a loss making company.

229
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Is this possible without any

230
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,839
political pressure or support from any political

231
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,600
collusion?  You can tell it yourself

232
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,320
in the comment section.  Ok?

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,880
Because most of the banks were government owned.  Let me

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,040
also tell you that out of all the 17 banks,

235
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,279
many were government banks.  Well the

236
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,959
second thing in this is that he is in a kind

237
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,720
of political collusion with Mallya and

238
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,720
who are those

239
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
specific people who have been continuously supporting him.  Proper investigation will be

240
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,560
possible only when he is brought here.

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,640
Explanation will be given.  And who knows, maybe the

242
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,279
acceleration is being continuously postponed because there are

243
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,680
many well-known people involved

244
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,240
in this entire scam whose names,

245
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,560
if revealed, would create problems for them.

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,920
Well another very strange thing was that on the

247
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,360

248
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,360

249
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,000

250
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,279
same day when the banks talked about seizing Mallya's passport for his arrest in the Depth Recovery Tribunal in DRT, he

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,200
left the country.  That means, you see, a

252
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,240
notice has been issued by the Supreme Court

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
that the next hearing is on this day.  Banks is

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,519
going to seize his passport.  But he flees the country.

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
Where did this prescheduled visit come from?

257
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,959
This was a properly planned visit, such that

258
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,720
you are thinking of fleeing the country on this day.  I am

259
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,120
thinking of doing the entire

260
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,000
legal proceedings and all the legal matters.

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,560
Well, Vijay Mallya got his first loan

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,640
in 2004.  After this it was

263
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,480
received in 2008.  Despite declaring all the assets of his companies as

264
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
non-performing assets,

265
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,680
the entire loan structure was restructured in 2010.  The

266
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,120

267
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,640
entire loan was restructured.

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,720

269
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,320
This is a big thing even though it was declared an NPA in 2010.  From here also, political

270
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
connections come to the fore.

271
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Now

272
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
both the parties have been continuously blaming each other.

273
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,600
But a very big

274
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,519
allegation has been made by Sambit Patra, who is the spokesperson of BJP.

275
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,440
He had imposed it.  He said that

276
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,200
during the time of Congress he had applied it by name.  So it becomes

277
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
more important to mention it here

278
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
because you are making allegations on someone by name

279
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,480
and if the opposite party is

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
countering it then what is it saying

281
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,279
and if it is not countering it

282
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,519
because here the counter was not done in that manner, then

283
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,920
why does it become necessary to tell this statement.

284
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,720
Samit Patra had said that during the

285
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,040
Congress regime from 2004 to 2014, the

286
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,760
finance minister got the

287
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,160
No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Malia by putting pressure on the State Bank of India

288
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,880
and the

289
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,720
bank officials got the United Breweries which was

290
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,959
Malia's company, Malia's father had

291
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,519
started it with soil Himalaya.

292
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,760
United Bureau had

293
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
asked the officials of the bank to meet him.  He was

294
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,560
ordered that he has to go and meet him.

295
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,200
According to Samit Patra,

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,839
bailout package was given to Kingfisher Reliance on the advice of Manmohan Singh.  In

297
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,399
fact, at that time the

298
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,120
Income Tax Department was also pressured to unfreeze Mallya's

299
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,120
accounts.

300
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,959
Therefore the Income Tax

301
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
Department also showed leniency there.  All these

302
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,680
things have been said.  All these things

303
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
come to light.  So you see that

304
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,360
political collusion is definitely there in this case.

305
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,279
Well, both the parties were involved.

306
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,959
No doubt about it.  Both parties were

307
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,880
involved.  But Mallya's defence is

308
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,120
probably continuing till now

309
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,839
because a very big political nexus is

310
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,760
involved in it.  Well overall, the process of expressing Mallya's

311
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
case is

312
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,120
continuously going on in London.

313
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,600
One of his dramas happened suddenly.  This is from 2020.

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,600
An extra drama took place in a UK court at the

315
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,079
Westminister Magistrates Court.

316
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,000
Basically the point there was that

317
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,600
you can talk about anything on the podcast.

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,079
Give any statement to the media outside.

319
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,760
Speaking of Malia.  But

320
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,920
in the court, your lawyers are representing you.

321
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,680

322
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
If they have nothing left to say then it means you

323
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,800
are a puppet.  You have done those things.  The

324
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,560
lawyer in front of you is completely accusing you of doing

325
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,360

326
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,760
wrong things.  What happened here was that the hearing of Mallya's

327
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
exemption appeal was

328
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,160
going on in the West Indies Magistrate Court

329
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,920
in London. The lawyer representing India

330
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,880
was Mark Summers and the lawyer representing Mallya was

331
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,120
Claire Mattcom. There was a

332
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,279
continuous heated debate.

333
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
Officers of CBI, ED, Indian High Commission were

334
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,200
also present there. Everyone had gone to

335
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,760
say something on behalf of Mallya. The

336
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,399
Indian lawyer Mark Summers

337
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,800
said that the

338
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,600
loan that Mallya and Kingfisher had taken from IDBI Bank and SBI in 2009 was

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,000

340
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,160
taken through false profitable projections.  Misrepresented his company's

341
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
profitable projections.

342
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,560
Showed fake profitable projections.

343
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,639
Secondly, the company's profits and losses were

344
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
not disclosed to the banks.  Neither

345
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,040
IDB nor SBI, which

346
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
was a consortium of 17 banks, was informed.

347
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,600
Here it has been completely proved dishonest.

348
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,320
But on the other hand when it was

349
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,560
Mallya's lawyer's turn, no

350
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,959

351
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,839
statement came on what he said. What was his statement on that

352
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,320
Mallya could not repay the loan my

353
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,680
lord because at that time it was a genuine

354
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,160
business failure, he really suffered losses, his

355
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,920
company's aviation industry was facing

356
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,720
a lot of challenges in India at that time,

357
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,360
that's why he could not repay the loan brother

358
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
what is the case, the case is that you presented

359
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,880
fake documents, your fake company

360
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,560
's projection in front of the banks and the main

361
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
point that comes up here is that

362
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,720
if a fake projection has been made in

363
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,120
front of the bank and if the bank has

364
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,680
checked and verified it properly,

365
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,240
then what question arises here that was

366
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,480
it because of pressure from one very big

367
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,440
minister or several very big ministers

368
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,839
and there was pressure from both the parties, there was

369
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,720
pressure, that's why the

370
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,240
banks acted in this manner.  Well, this

371
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,560
case was completely about a fake loan.

372
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,199
Meaning that Mallya has taken fake loans.

373
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,959
Well, now we have discussed all these

374
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,120
factors directly.  Now let us come to the claims made by Mallya in this

375
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,800
podcast.  These claims that he has

376
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
made, at least seven to eight claims, will

377
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,399
now be exposed.

378
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600

Best wishes.  So now let's start our

397
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,480
episode.  So let's move ahead with our episode.

398
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,440
First claim of Mallya, I personally did

399
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,320
not take a single penny.  The loans were for King Fisher.

400
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,680
This is the first claim.  Mallya is saying

401
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,000
that he never took a single penny, a single

402
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,680
rupee from the bank.  I did

403
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,320
not take any such loan for myself.  He

404
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,360
took a loan.  Kfisher Airlines has taken a loan.

405
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,800
He says he was just a guarantor.  Ok

406
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,320
?  He also said that the depth figure of ₹9000 crores is

407
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,639

408
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,759
clearly written in the certificate of the Depth Recovery Tribunal (DRT)

409
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,680
that the depth figure is 6203

410
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
crores, so where did this figure of ₹9000 crores

411
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,800
come from, this is basically what the Himalayas are

412
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,880
saying.  He has said that this

413
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,600
depth figure of Rs 6203 crore is written in DRT.  Plus

414
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,600
including 11.5% interest on that.

415
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,279
Basically he is saying how

416
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,680
responsible I am.  They have

417
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,720
even shown my depth figure incorrectly and secondly, I have

418
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,639
not taken a single penny.  Now technically

419
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,920
yes, the loan was taken for Kingfisher Airlines.

420
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,399
But who was the guarantor?

421
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,360
Who is Vijay Mallya legally responsible?  Vijay

422
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,000
Mallya.  Is it too difficult to understand the meaning of such a small thing?  The

423
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,240
guarantor is Vijay

424
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,560
Mallya.  Vijay Mallya is legally bound.

425
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,120
Who will repay if the airline defaults

426
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,240
?  Vijay Mallya.  Which is in writing,

427
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,320
which is the documentation, still if such a thing

428
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,839
comes to light, in order to show yourself as innocent, in order to

429
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,519
show yourself as innocent,

430
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,399
you are becoming an object of ridicule. Well, the

431
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,880
Supreme Court of India, the

432
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,680
CBI, the ED have clearly said

433
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,519
that Mallya is accountable for the entire depth

434
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,839
because he was the guarantor and this figure of Rs 9,000 crores is

435
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,520
basically the

436
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,079
total of the overall principal and the interest, which has

437
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,919
continuously increased with time.  You have been

438
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,480
continuously conducting this event for so long, in a way,

439
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,559
you have been a fugitive for years.

440
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,880
You have run away from here.  So this constant

441
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:25,039
figure is bigger.  The DRT figure of

442
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,120
₹6203 crores is just a base amount.

443
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,600
But as the interest

444
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,400
of penalties has been continuously imposed on you over time,

445
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,760
this figure has reached this level.  Well,

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,559
other than that, leave this figure alone.  I say,

447
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,760
if you are saying that you did

448
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:45,679
not take a single penny, then what about that ₹900 crore

449
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,240
loan that you got from IDBI Bank?

450
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,080
You used that money to buy properties and to rent your properties abroad and to

451
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,760

452
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,160
acquire different assets.

453
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,880
Meaning if the money had to be paid, it was

454
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,280
taken by Kingfer Airlines.  If I want to blow money then

455
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,840
I will blow it.  Vijay Mallya will fly him.   It is

456
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,720
ridiculous but equally

457
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,360
serious because such claims are being made.

458
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,480
So anyway, ₹900 crores, it's official.

459
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,320
CBI is an alliance of ED.  It has been clearly

460
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,120
established that Mallya diverted

461
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,000
₹900 crore from the loan taken from IDBI Bank

462
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,080
which was

463
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,240
used to buy properties abroad.

464
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Properties used for renting.

465
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,160
And this show happened, it came to light here

466
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,720
that it has spun off

467
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,120
all the funds; our Indian

468
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,280
authorities have evidence of this, so this narrative that I was just a

469
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,520
guarantor, I did not do anything,

470
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,360
this will not work here and is not going to work

471
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,440
here, being a guarantor

472
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,200
means that it is your legal responsibility,

473
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,200
you will have to own that

474
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,520
responsibility and plus the proofs of diversion of

475
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,600
funds that are coming out,

476
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,440
your personal involvement is

477
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,200
clearly visible here.  Second claim of

478
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,240
Vijay Mallya is that I had told Arun Jaitley

479
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,760
before leaving India in 2016, I had

480
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,679
informed him about this and it was

481
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,440
already my trip, it was a pre-scheduled trip.

482
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,120
Mallya basically said that

483
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,799

484
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,200
he had

485
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,160
told the then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley inside the Parliament about his London Geneva trip.

486
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,640
1 minute.  But did you say

487
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
that I am going to run away.  I am

488
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,480
about to be declared a fugitive.  If I leave from here now, I will

489
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,520
not come back.

490
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,760
Now dispose of all the money you have because I am about to

491
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,720
leave.  Did you come out saying this

492
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,960
?  Here you told him about the London Geneva

493
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,520
trip, the official

494
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,840
statements are out.

495
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
You said that Vijay Mallya said that

496
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,600
he had also requested that I had

497
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,320

498
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,200
requested here to do the settlement with the bank.  On which figures did

499
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,080
you ever tell that on which figures

500
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,360

501
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,000
you were

502
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,240
not willing to give even half of your total amount of ₹9000 crore, how will the banks agree,

503
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,559
most of them are public sector banks, whom are you making

504
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,760
mad, whom are

505
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,520
you fooling continuously, well Vijay Mallya

506
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,919
said this very clearly in the podcast

507
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,440
that I had gone to meet Arun Jaitley, at first

508
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,960
he refused to accept it but later when

509
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,799
a Congress MP

510
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,360
saw it there, he countered

511
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,240
that yes, I had seen Arun Jaitley

512
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,799
meeting Vijay Mallya.  Later

513
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,120
Arun Jaitley said that yes a fleeting

514
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,679
meeting had taken place.  Meaning, a meeting took place suddenly in the morning.

515
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,240
Where Mallya had said

516
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,440
that yes he is going.  He is going

517
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,799
somewhere.  Mallya is basically saying that

518
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,559
I had openly said that I am leaving.  And

519
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
secondly, there is nothing to hide in this.

520
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,880
This was my prescheduled visit.

521
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,200
I had to go through this.  Everyone already knew

522
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,880
about this.  The first thing you did

523
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
n't tell anyone was that you were going to run away.  Secondly,

524
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,080
Arun Jaitley had clarified this in 2018.

525
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,880
He said this when it

526
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,880
came to light that it was a member of the Parliament

527
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,120
who had seen Mallya

528
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,720
meeting Jaitley.  After he spoke, Arun

529
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,240
Jaitley's statement came out in which he

530
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,440
said that yes a brief meeting was held.  There was a small

531
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,360
meeting with Malia

532
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,360
in the Parliament.  Where Malia said

533
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,200
that he wants to settle something

534
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,440
with the banks.  But continuously, because this is a

535
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,159
process, a detailed meeting should have been held

536
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,559
on this.  Did Mallya properly go for

537
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,400
a proper appointment to have

538
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,240
a meeting with Jaitley

539
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,799
and other bank authorities

540
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
before fleeing India?

541
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,880
Later, the claims that are coming out are that I

542
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,120
told the chief of SBI, even the head

543
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
in Hyderabad that let's have a meeting, I am

544
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,120
ready to pay the money.

545
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,120
What did you do during your time in India?  Well,

546
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,640
this political nexus is clearly

547
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,480
visible here.  There is no denying that

548
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
no politician

549
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,799
or many politicians did

550
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,799
not help Mallya to escape.  Because Mallya left India on 2 March 2016.  He has

551
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,280
run away from here.  Just

552
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,919
a day later, Banks pleaded

553
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,120
in the Supreme Court for his arrest and seizure of his passport.  A

554
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,400
plea was filed.  Plus

555
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,919
CBI arrested him in October 2015, see this he

556
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,360
ran away in 2016.  In October 2015, that is

557
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,919
almost 6-seven months ago, a lookout

558
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,240
notice was issued against Mallya saying that this person will

559
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,600
not be allowed to escape from India.

560
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,640
He did not run away from India.  Because of this,

561
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,720
a lookout notice would be issued on it which was a

562
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
block notice.  That means it will be completely

563
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,880
blocked.  Will be stopped

564
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,559
from fleeing from India.  But just after a month,

565
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,400
in November 2015, this lookout notice was

566
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,320
changed to report notice.  The

567
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,880
CBI said at that time that there was a

568
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,480
technical mistake.  This is visible due to a technical glitch.

569
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,919

570
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:38,559
Sometimes typing errors occur in what is written.  But there

571
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:41,120
is no second opinion on this or in one way

572
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,880
you can look at it that no second thought

573
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,960
ever comes to mind that this would

574
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
not have been done intentionally or it would not have been done under someone's pressure.

575
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,520
Because

576
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,919
Subramaniam Swamy, who himself is a great

577
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,520
leader, is a politician.  He himself

578
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
said this along with many senior Congress leaders who

579
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,200
alleged here that

580
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,559
all these things were done deliberately.  It is a fact

581
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,640
that both parties

582
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,919
continuously accuse each other in the Mallya case.

583
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,240
Malia's diplomatic passport was

584
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,799
not confiscated.  While

585
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,640
the person had committed such a huge fraud, he

586
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,200
still had his diplomatic passport with him inside the country.

587
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,679
His sudden departure does

588
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,400
not indicate that his visit was a pre-scheduled one.

589
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,280
This was just a proper

590
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,159
planning by Mallya to flee from India.

591
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,840
He will run away on this day and at this time.  He was

592
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,400
also aware about the notice.  Was aware of everything.

593
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,080

594
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,080
He was also aware of the changes made by the CBI.  And there were all these

595
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,520
things.  Basically that's why Malia

596
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,760
ran away from here.  Well, there is a political nexus

597
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,280
behind this.  No one can deny this.

598
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,039
Malia also says the same thing over and over again, so

599
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,320
he's just making this thing his issue.

600
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,919
A power is creating its own.  He is

601
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,320
making a statement power statement

602
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,400
so that he can prove himself innocent.

603
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,919
But he never talks about

604
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,880
how

605
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,320
wrong he had shown his company's profit projections to the

606
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,240
banks while taking loans.  This

607
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,360
is his next statement.  Third statement is that

608
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,600
I am not a thief.  Went on a prescheduled visit

609
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,240
and did not return.  Because of some valid reasons.

610
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,880
Malia says basically

611
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,320
he is not a thief.  He has not fled from India.

612
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,720
He says that he is just left.  I just

613
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,520
left.  I had a visit already

614
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,279
scheduled in March 2016, I went here as per that

615
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,840
and I am not coming back

616
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,159
because unfair trials will be conducted against me.   The

617
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,600
bad detention conditions

618
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,840
in India are not hidden from anyone.  A UK

619
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,279
court sides with the UK court here.

620
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
So its statement of the UK

621
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,679
court shows that the conditions of Indian detention

622
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,200
valorize the European Convention of

623
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,360
Human Rights, ECHR, that is,

624
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,159
it even brings the ECHR to the fore.  He

625
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,720
said that the UK court believes

626
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,120
that the detention conditions in India are worst and

627
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,440
useless.  Do you know who used the same thing

628
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,200
?  This same statement, the person

629
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,159
whom we have dragged and brought recently, Tabur Rana, who will be

630
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,080
called a terrorist of 261, had

631
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,720
helped David Comman Haley, had killed 177 innocent people,

632
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,279
here in India,

633
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,679
these 10 terrorists of Lashkar-e-Taba had helped him, that

634
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,440
Rana, whom we have dragged from UK, had

635
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,120
given the same statement here,

636
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,919

637
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,600
for not being explored in India, he had also said the same thing in the court in UK that the

638
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,360
detention conditions there are very bad,

639
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,080
I will be tortured even more there.  I

640
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,159
cannot go to India.

641
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,480

642
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,880

643
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,880
Under the UARC United, this European EHRC European Convention on Human Rights, the UK court should deny

644
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,400
sending me to India.  They repeat the same things

645
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,840
continuously.  Will commit crime from India.

646
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
Will commit crime in India.  They will

647
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,760
go out and argue as if they are

648
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,919
completely innocent.  Well, the Himalayas did the same thing here

649
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,840
also.  But now

650
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,159
look at this argument of AHRC, the US

651
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,400
court had approved the extradition in 2020 itself.  It

652
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,559

653
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
is almost approved.  Just telling here that this is

654
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,720
a confidential matter.  It is a confidential legal matter

655
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,640
due to which it is being delayed.

656
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,919
Now what is this legal confidential matter

657
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,760
?  Who knows, the issue may not arise against governments

658
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,600
or any specific individuals.

659
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,159
Because of this,

660
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,000
this legal matter is coming to the fore.  The

661
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,679
UK

662
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,600
court did not mention any such detention conditions in Malia's case.  What

663
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,679
Malia is saying, here he is

664
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,320
giving a statement of ECHR, he is

665
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,559
giving his argument, he is giving this after looking at other cases,

666
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,480
his lawyer has told him

667
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,559
that such things are said in other cases,

668
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,440
before sending him to India,

669
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,679
you have to say this in the expulsion in front of everyone, this is what he is

670
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,919
doing.  The next claim of Manaliya is that

671
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,039
I have apologised to the Kingfisher employees

672
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,600
but could not pay their salaries because the court

673
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,919
and the bank have put

674
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,520
a lot of restrictions on me and that is why I

675
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:52,159
only apologised to them and

676
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,320
could not pay their salaries.  Let us expose this once and for all in depth.  Let me

677
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,240
tell you.

678
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,640
Mallya says that

679
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,400
I was not able to pay the salaries to the Kingfisher employees.

680
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,159
Why couldn't you give it?  Because there are

681
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,640
restrictions imposed by the court and the bank

682
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,400

683
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,360
regarding the transfer of assets to the transferors of assets.  He can't make much money selling things from here to there.

684
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,960
Basically, these are Vijay Mallya

685
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,679
's employees

686
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,320
who have not been paid their salaries.

687
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,559
He made the excuse that Karnataka High Court and

688
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,039
banks have imposed a ban.  He is prohibited from transferring or disposing of his

689
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,799
movable and immovable properties and assets.  Has been

690
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,760

691
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,159
done

692
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,080
If you do this, it will be a violation of the court.

693
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:36,240
But then why did

694
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,840
Mallya secretly transfer $40 million

695
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,159
to the accounts of his three children in 2016?

696
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,480

697
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,240
Why did you send them to the three children by creating one trust for all three?  This 40

698
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,240
million dollars was in 2016 from

699
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,880
a company named Diag Dugue PLC which is a British

700
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,520
alcoholic company.  A payment came from there.  There might be

701
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
some old payment.  The

702
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,559
40 million dollars that came into Mallia's accounts in 2016,

703
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,240
just convert it and see

704
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,720
how much it is in Indian rupees, not once but many

705
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,919
times, the salaries of all the employees are

706
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,480
paid, what did Mallia do with the 40 million in this?

707
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,440
Malia secretly sent it to her

708
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,760
Edmund D Rawchild Swiss Bank,

709
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,279
Switzerland. This account of hers was

710
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,520
not told

711
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,679
to the authorities, Mallia

712
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,760

713
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,200

714
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,760
sent it to an account in Edmund D Rawchild Swiss Bank, Switzerland.  This $million was

715
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,919
never told this.

716
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,919
What did he do with this money?  His three

717
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,159
children are Siddharth and Siddharth Mallya from his first wife

718
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,640
and Tina

719
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,159
and Leena Mallya from his second wife.  It was transferred as a gift deeds to the accounts of both of them.

720
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,320

721
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,399
 

722
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,000
If you calculate 40 million, look at the current price of dollar

723
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,520
or even see by the price at that time,

724
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,640
how much it would be by applying an average.  This

725
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,559
entire money was transferred into the three trusts.

726
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,320
When the Supreme Court came to know about

727
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,559
this during investigation, the

728
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,159
Supreme Court asked Mallya to

729
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,039
return the entire money within four weeks.

730
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,720
He didn't.  This money was given by

731
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,320
Mallya to his unpaid employees, from whom he made them work, from whom he took hard work, and on whose

732
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,960
hard work and

733
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,799
sweat, this extravagance, this

734
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,679
lavish lifestyle of Mallya was being run;

735
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,279
this money was not given to those employees in India

736
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,360
because it is not on priority.  The

737
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,360
priority is family,

738
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,679
children and especially one's own money.  No matter how

739
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,960
much fraud you commit, at the end it is the same thing

740
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,840
that if it has to fly then Mallya will fly it and

741
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,120
if it has to be repaid then Kingfisher Airlines had

742
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,760
taken the loan, brother.  Yes, Mallya's next

743
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,919
claim is that the collapse of Kingfisher has

744
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,399

745
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,880
happened due to political pressure and bureaucracy.  Look, the first thing is

746
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,039
that the political pressure which you are saying is the

747
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,840
reason behind the collapse of Kingfisher.

748
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,600
Whatever your rise has been,

749
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,679
these politicians and

750
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,240
this political system have had a major role in it.  It belonged to these

751
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:04,080
bureaucrats.  The way you have risen consistently, the

752
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,360

753
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,640
things that you have done with RCB, the F1 race team, all this was

754
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,039
due to them somewhere or the other.  The

755
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,159
facilities that you got, the loan of Rs. 7000 crore that you got

756
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,000
from 17 consortium banks, all this was because of this

757
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,159
bureaucracy and these politicians.

758
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,080
He had a hand in it somewhere at that

759
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,600
time also.  What you said, the

760
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,520
collapse of Kingfisher happened because of these people.

761
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,279
He also had a hand in lifting it.

762
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,600
Don't forget this.

763
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,360
Mallya directly blamed the UPA

764
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,320
government.  Especially to the then Finance

765
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,559
Minister Pranab Mukherjee.  He said that

766
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,480
Pranab Mukherjee displeased me when

767
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,440
I told him that I

768
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,520
wanted to downsize Kingfisher.  Kingfisher

769
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,440
is running in loss.  There are many things.

770
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,760
He had refused at that time.  The second thing he

771
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,200
said was that the delay happened because of the FDI rules.

772
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,720
One of my very good dealings was the

773
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,520
Etihad Airways deal, which was a

774
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,840
potential deal, which got delayed because of the

775
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,880
FDI rules because of which my

776
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,159
airline collapsed.   The

777
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,799
reality is that 2008 was no doubt a tough time not just

778
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,520
for Kingfisher but for the overall Indian

779
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,840
aviation industry.   There

780
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,320
was a financial crisis.  Regulatory

781
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,840
hurdles were being seen in the aviation industry.  It is not

782
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,520
just Kingfisher that is being

783
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
seen at that time, other

784
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,440
airlines which are working well today were

785
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,440
also there at that time.  If we

786
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,080
talk about the case of Kingfisher and Mallya, Kingfisher was

787
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,919
hurt. We can understand from this, no

788
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:36,080
doubt, but Mallya's own decisions,

789
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:39,279
which included an aggressive expansion of

790
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,679
about 5 years to fly internationally.

791
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,080
After forming Kingfisher Airlines,

792
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,559
he

793
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,279
acquired Air Deccan, merged it, and

794
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,840
bought it within himself. In a way, it takes 5 years. You have to

795
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,880
run it for 5 years until

796
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,519
you cannot travel abroad, cannot do foreign operations,

797
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,679

798
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,000
cannot send your flights out of India. But Air Deccan was

799
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,240
merged, it was a heavy debt company at that

800
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,480
time. Air Deccan was

801
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,880
also merged at that time. The

802
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,480
lavish lifestyle was

803
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:18,000
continued. All these were also the reasons for the

804
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,080
sinking of Kingfisher. Why are these being hidden? What

805
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,039
Mallya said in a podcast was that he

806
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,640
invited Enri Keglesias on his birthday. No

807
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,720
problem. He bought the team. No problem.

808
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,360
He bought the racing team. No problem.

809
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,000
This doesn't matter to me.  If it did not cost money, then it could have been

810
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,640
invested in the company there too, I could have

811
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,640

812
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,240
created a separate fund for the salaries of the employees, so that if there is ever a crisis or any

813
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,720
problem in the company, at

814
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,039
least my employees get their

815
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,200
salaries on time, I could have created such a fund or

816
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,120
not, so these are many

817
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,799
things.  Look, it's a matter of destiny.  The intentions

818
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,799
are bad.  Isn't it?  Second thing, let us

819
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,640
talk about the Etihad deal.  Mallya is saying that the failure of the Etihad deal

820
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,840

821
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,000
happened because of FDI rules.  But basically

822
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,320
it comes to light that Kingfisher was in such a big financial mess

823
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,480
at that time.  There was such a huge financial

824
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,039
mess that no investor or any

825
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,519
big company could even think of merging it.  Did

826
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,080
not want to touch Kingfisher without a major

827
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,679
restructuring.  Unless they

828
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,600
restructure their entire structure.  The

829
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,039
old people, who have become

830
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,679
useless in a way, were

831
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,159
removed and a separate structure was created according to the other

832
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,679
investors. Until

833
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,440
that time, the

834
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,880
Etihad deal was

835
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,159
not because of FDI rules, it was the

836
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,039
structure for Mallya's own Kingfisher, it was

837
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,679
spoiled due to mismanagement. The

838
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,519
next claim of Mallya is that I had

839
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,600
given settlement offers to the banks but they

840
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,600
refused and did not accept it.

841
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,080
Mallya says that he

842
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,679
gave four settlement offers between 2012 and 2015

843
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,440
and in fact, one of them was such that

844
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,799

845
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,120
this offer was given to the chairperson of SBI in Hyderabad.

846
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,919
But he demanded Rs 14,000 crore

847
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,600
instead of the principal amount.   The

848
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,440
first thing in this is that whatever

849
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,960
offers were made by Mallya, it has been clearly

850
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,360
stated here officially that

851
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,960
he was offering the principal amount only

852
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,560
for the principal amount.  Any

853
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,520
penalties that are imposed on him, any interest that is

854
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,079
charged, he does not have to pay it.

855
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,079

856
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,159
These offers were given by Mallya after cutting a huge amount and according to his own conditions.

857
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,720
All the offers were

858
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,879
condition based.  I wanted to get the work done on my conditions.  I did

859
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,040

860
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,720
not want to take full liability for anything.  Therefore these

861
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,440
offers were not accepted.

862
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,599
This is such a huge massive cut, public funds are

863
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,599
involved in it.  The 17 consortium banks were

864
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,679
mostly government banks.  First thing is that there are

865
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,679

866
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,599
many public sector banks.  Second thing is that

867
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,839
public funds are involved in this.  Any

868
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,839
bank taking such a big cut

869
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,119
assumed all the liabilities including interest on itself, so

870
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,760
why would it pay for all the extravagances that the bank indulged in

871
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,679
?  They would want that they should

872
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,640
get the full amount which is due.   By imposing

873
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,640
penalties and interest.  This is

874
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,280
not what Malia was wanting.  Every

875
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,200
offer he gave to Kandi was conditional.

876
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,720
He never took full liability.  The court

877
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,800
documents even say that the

878
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,880
offers were inadequate.  For this reason it was

879
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,040
not taken.  And after this tell me that

880
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,280
you have given this offer continuously for years

881
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,280
after a long time.  For years you did

882
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,680
not cooperate with the Indian authorities

883
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,680
, with the Indian judicial system, in fact,

884
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,000

885
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,320
you invited the judicial system and ran away.  Why are you called a fugitive

886
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,560
?  This is the reason why it is called so.  You

887
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,079
ran away from here.  You are not willing to take the legal procedure at that time, it is

888
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,480
a good option that was

889
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,880
given to you.  But when you ran away from here and got

890
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,040
arrested, you were declared a fugitive, that

891
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,200
this person is a fugitive.  He has fled from India, he

892
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,960
is a fugitive.  Once this tag has been applied,

893
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,720
you will be

894
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,200
dealt with only through proper legal procedure.

895
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,480
Extradition will be done for you.  After that there

896
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,480
will be a proper legal trial.  Only then will you be dealt with.

897
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,200
Why would India deal with a thief or a fugitive

898
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,720
?   It

899
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,240
is a very big thing.  It does not depend on you like this,

900
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,119
India never did.   The

901
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,240
next claim is I want to come back to India

902
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,480
if there is a fair trial.  Mallya

903
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,240
says he is willing to return to

904
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,400
India if fair trial is assured.  He has

905
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,240
said that detention conditions are the same thing.

906
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,640
Nonsense over and over again.  My detention conditions should

907
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,119
not be political targeting.  I have been made a football.

908
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,680
This is his statement.  You

909
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,400
can think about it.  I mean,

910
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,280
how can any person give so much to himself?  And that too when at

911
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,839
one time it is true that

912
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,599
politicians had supported him.

913
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,079
Helped him to escape.  So at one time it is also

914
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,599
true that the

915
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,119
same

916
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,440
politicians and the same bureaucrats were behind the entire success that Kingfisher got.  It was

917
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,440
because of him that so much

918
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,000
resourcefulness was coming into this whole organization,

919
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,079
this whole company.  Well the point is

920
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,200
that if Mallya was serious about

921
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,520
coming back to India, he would have engaged with the Indian authorities

922
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,560
, with the ministries, there are so many

923
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,720
agencies like ED, CBI,

924
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,920
Finance Ministry and their officials.  I

925
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,040
would approach him.

926
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,880
After 9 years I wouldn't suddenly

927
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,200
appear on a 4 hour podcast and sit down for a soft spoken interview.

928
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,760
There, one does

929
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,520
not give his explanation by declaring himself innocent.  If I

930
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,000
want to come to India completely.

931
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,240
But the reality is that the CBI, ED,

932
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,359
Supreme Court of India, Supreme Court

933
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,440
rulings, contempt charges have been continuously

934
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,480
imposed on him for so many years.   This

935
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,000
clearly shows that there are cases of serious fraud and money laundering against him.  There

936
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,520

937
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,320
are serious charges.  And this is clear evidence that because of this,

938
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,920
he doesn't want to come here.

939
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,400
We have told you the argument regarding the detention conditions; the

940
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,400
UK court has said

941
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,000
similar things in other cases.  Nothing

942
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,400

943
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,480
like this has ever been said in this specific case of Mallya.  And what Mallya has

944
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,480
said overall is that I want to come to India

945
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,640
if I am given a fair trial.

946
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,119
This is just a publicity

947
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,720
stunt to clean up one's image.

948
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,359
Basically a maximum picture,

949
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,520
if you look at it in the big picture,

950
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,800
if you look at it in the big picture, then the

951
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,359
overall picture of Malia, many people are seeing it this way on

952
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,720
Twitter, on social media,

953
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:20,079
that it was a PR game.  One such PR

954
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,880
game where a podcast of Mallya was aired.  It

955
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,680
was a planned move by Mallya to

956
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,160
reshape his own image.  And people on Twitter are

957
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,760
also saying that a tough podcaster was chosen

958
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,760

959
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,119
over a tough journalist.  Meaning that if a tough journalist had been there in

960
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,880
front of him, Mallya would not have been able to last even for 5 minutes.

961
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,119

962
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,280

963
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,280
This entire podcast was aired in a controlled environment without any hard questions and it was clear

964
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,920
that Mallya had done all these things intentionally.  The

965
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,760
court, the Supreme

966
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,320
Court of India, has repeatedly said

967
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,720
that Mallya diverted the funds.

968
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,560
Left his employees alone.  Left them unpaid.

969
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,280
Salary was not paid and the

970
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,640
creditors were continuously avoided.

971
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,440
Sirius, there are charges against him.  There

972
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,560
are cases of money laundering.

973
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,240
Blaming it on political pressure and bureaucracy.  No

974
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,400
doubt these people would have been involved

975
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,400
with Mallya till the time he was here and

976
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
he ran away from here.  There is nothing big in this.

977
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,520
It can be possible.  Who knows,

978
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,720
these things may also come out in further investigation.

979
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,359
But this blame game

980
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,880
of Mallya is a perfect way to divert attention from her mismanagement.

981
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,200
Proven.  So this was today

982
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,960
's video.  You all must have seen the podcast of Vijay Mala.  It

983
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,640
is very viral

984
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,079
all over India.  Many things are being

985
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,920
said about him in it.  Some

986
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,320
people are calling him innocent.  Some people are saying that the

987
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,599
media is making mistakes.  Some are saying the

988
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,839
government is involved.  The whole system is corrupt.

989
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,440
All things are there.  But
