00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,559
Hello, welcome to Career 247. I am

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,040
Prashant Dhawan. Now, this video is being

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,679
seen all over the world today. Many people are feeling

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,519
scared about their flight after watching this video,

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,080
because the way

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,160
this Air India

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,519
flight, a Boeing Dreamliner 787, has crashed in the Indian state of Gujarat.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,320
This is horrifying. The

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,039
visuals that have come out are being seen by the entire world. I have

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,440
many friends who are in Europe

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
, in the US.  Seeing these visuals, it

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
suddenly came to his mind that there is suddenly anxiety about our

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
flights in the future.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,640
Because the

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,559
way this flight has crashed, no one is able to

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,640
understand what exactly has happened here.

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,600
Because if you see the route of this flight,

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,600

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,199
you will be able to see it from Ahmedabad city of Gujarat.  This is Ahmedabad airport.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,120
This flight took off from here and

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,840
its route was London.  This flight was to go to the UK.  It

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,080
was a long journey.  Now now I will

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,400
have to mention this here also.  When there is an

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,119
international journey in a big

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,479
aircraft, then a lot of fuel is also

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,040
carried in it.  And suppose such a

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,439
flight crashes, then since it was

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,840
carrying a lot of extra fuel, the explosion that

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,000
occurs is all the more

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
painful.  So right now you are

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
seeing these visuals, you are watching the videos in front of you.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,520
If you are wondering

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,680
how such a big explosion happened?  So see, this flight was

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
going carrying fuel.  That would

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,640
take it all the way to London.  And if

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,799
you people here are thinking, wait, this flight was

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,040
going from Gujarat to UK and it crashed in Gujarat itself.

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,240
See,

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,439
this flight suddenly crashes just a short distance away from Ahmedabad airport.  The

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,320
pilots here had more

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,360
than 8000 hours of experience.

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,640
No one understands what

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,119
happened suddenly that after travelling a short distance this airplane just

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,960
crashes.  A huge explosion occurs.

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,560
And the unfortunate thing is that there were a

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,880
total of 242 passengers in this plane who belonged to different countries.

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
If you look at Air India's

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,440
Twitter page, everything has been

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,920
blacked out today.  Profile photo banner

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,800
everything because this is a big accident.  If

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,680
I talk about intensity, then

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,920
this is the biggest air accident in the last 15 years

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
in the history of India. It is possible that this may

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,360
also become the biggest accident in 25 years if the

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,599
casualties here cross 150 or

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,160
160.  The last time the country

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,360

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,080
saw an airplane disaster of this level was in 2010 when unfortunately

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,319
158 people died.  It is not yet confirmed where

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
Air India Flight 171

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,319
crashed here in Gujarat.

62
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,000
How many people have died here?  But Air India has

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,599

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,040
blacked out its social media handles everywhere.  And below these people have

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,440
confirmed the nationality of the passengers.  There were 168

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,400
Indians here and 53 British

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,879
nationals here.  Was a Canadian National.  There

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
were seven Portuguese here.  So

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,680
look at this incident, whatever investigation will be done, most

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
likely UK, Portugal, even

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,440
Canadian governments may get

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,440
involved and look online, there are

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,519
a lot of theories going around today.  Some are

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
saying that it was sabotage.  Something has happened etc.

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,800
No one knows, until the black box of the plane is

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
found, we will

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,360
not get proper information about what happened and

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,840
many people were also asking this question

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
whether former Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Rupani was also present here, so the answer to this is yes,

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,440
ex-Chief Minister of Gujarat was also here

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
and some reports are claiming that

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,319
his name is also there in the casualties, again the

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,239
actual number of how many people have died here is

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,720
not out yet because many people are also

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,440
badly injured here and I will

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,920
also have to tell you that in these images that you are seeing,

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,400
where did this plane crash

89
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400
?  This building is a

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,280
doctor's hostel.  Many people are saying

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,159
that yes, this was a hospital.  No,

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,280
a hostel had been built for doctors.  After reaching there,

93
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,439
the plane crashed on its roof.  15

94
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,840
doctors who lived here have also been seriously

95
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,239
injured.  Again this is a

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,319
tragedy.  This is perhaps it will be mentioned as

97
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
one of the biggest tragedies that has happened in the history of India.

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,040
And the

99
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,480
world is also watching this tragedy

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
because this is the first time that Boeing's 787

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,519
Dreamliner, which is considered to be their best plane, has

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,079
crashed

103
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,560
and these are the images in front of you of the

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,960
inside of the hostel, where doctors were having their food,

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,080
some were resting, suddenly a Boeing

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,479
787 comes with a lot of fuel and there is a huge

107
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,560
blast, people get badly injured, the

108
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,360
more I read about this accident

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,080
the more sad my heart becomes

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,479
and if we compare this accident with other global

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,280
disasters, you will note a pattern.

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,600
Recently, look around the world,

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
many of Boeing's planes have

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
crashed one by one and people have

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,639
often

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,960
raised questions on the quality of Boeing airplanes.  Now

117
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,360
what has happened in this particular case?  Has something been sabotaged

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
?  Is there some conspiracy?  Was there some

119
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,520
engine fault here?  I will tell you this again.  Don't

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,360
speculate about this right now.

121
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,199
Details of the black box would be being extracted at this time.

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
Very soon we will

123
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,320
know what happened here.  But

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,720
either way this is another crash of a Boeing airplane

125
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,320
which has happened within a gap of just a few months.

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,160
Before this, you will remember that in December 2024,

127
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,840
literally on 29th December 2024, there was a South Korean

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,320
flight Jeju Air 2216 which

129
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,280
crashed badly.  94 people lost their lives.

130
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,440
Boeing officially

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,000
offered its condolences, saying what has happened is very bad.

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,639
Now the actual reason for the crash of this flight has

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,639
not been revealed till date.

134
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,880
Some people say, look, those birds, those

135
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,560
ducks, were stuck in the engine.

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
Because of that the engine stopped again and it

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,120
crashed.  This is very rare

138
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,520
and even when the black box was studied, no

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
proper information was found as to

140
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,960
why this plane crashed

141
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,680
and apart from that, if you observe,

142
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,919
in 2024, Boeing's plane constantly

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
remains in the news somewhere or the other.  It is not necessary

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,560
that every time a G crashes and you know

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,120
100-200 people get killed.  Many times this plane suddenly performs a

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,600
malfunction.  All that is heard in the news is that

147
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
look, the plane has skidded

148
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,360
or some other problem has occurred here.   There was

149
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
some severe turbulence.  But

150
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,520
constantly we are seeing that

151
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,360
these instances related to Boeing planes are

152
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,759
increasing.  And I would

153
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
say that it is not a small thing that

154
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,160
in the span of just a few months, two big flights, a South Korean flight and

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
now an Indian flight, have

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
crashed and many people have lost their

157
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,639
lives here and after this crash in Gujarat,

158
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,280
in the times to come you will see that

159
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,560
this name John Barnett will be discussed a lot in India.

160
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,199
He was a whistle blower.  He

161
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,039
worked at Boeing for 30 years as a quality

162
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,600
manager.

163
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,400
In 2019, he gave an interview to BBC

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,639
and openly said that all the

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,360
planes being made in Boeing are

166
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,600
standard.  These people

167
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
use these parts in many places.  These are of very

168
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,479
poor quality.  Here you will be able to see

169
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,560
these 2019 Barnet Claims that Workers were

170
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,560
Forced.  Literally, workers often used to

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
say that the parts we are installing

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
in Boeing 787 are of very

173
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,680
poor quality.  There might be a problem tomorrow.

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Then pressure was put on them to

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,240
meet the deadline.  Production has to be increased.  The

176
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,400
company needs profit.  So somehow by

177
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,800
adding crooked parts they

178
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,720

179
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,880
sent the Boeing Dream Liner forward for production, you know.  And they had

180
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,759
pointed out many issues that the

181
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,080
emergency oxygen system in Boeing 787

182
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,880
can fail during the flight.  And

183
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,039
Boeing's stock suffered huge losses.  Because

184
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,680
of John Bard.  You can say that he caused a

185
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,240
loss of millions to Boeing.

186
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,919
Now what happens suddenly?  He

187
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,160
exposed Boeing.  Suddenly after a few years he gets

188
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,479
killed in mysterious circumstances.  Was

189
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,039
sitting alone in my house.  He

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,680
shot himself without any reason and his family has

191
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,879
recently filed a case against Boeing.  His

192
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,639
family has said that John Barnett was subjected to a sustained

193
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,280
campaign of harassment.  There was a

194
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,599
resolution when they raised

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,919
concerns about safety issues, so look at the present time,

196
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,080
in India too, the warnings given by John Barnett will be

197
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,680
read and studied

198
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,160
and perhaps now the time has come that we should

199
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,720
also see whether India has an

200
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,440
alternative to commercial airlines

201
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,680
because if you think about it, we are completely

202
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,759
dependent on the western world

203
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,319
for our flights, whatever airplanes we have

204
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,720
either come from Europe or the US,

205
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,879
we do not have any company of our own which can

206
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,760
manufacture these airplanes.  China has already

207
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,000

208
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,279
started the process of replacing Boeing 737 and other aircraft.

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,680
Recently their C919 has

210
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,080
also passed many tests.  However, it remains to be seen whether

211
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,880
they will be able to make a plane that can compete with Boeing or

212
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,360
not.  But China is

213
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,160
quite clear that it does

214
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,640
not want to depend on the US or Europe

215
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,200
for its aircraft needs.  So now look,

216
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,800
this crash will be studied and evaluated.

217
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
What happened here?

218
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,160
Actually, like in the South Korea case, there have been

219
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,519
a lot of bird hits here

220
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,920
or was there some engine issue?  I think whatever

221
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,360
result comes out here will be in the long term.

222
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,519
Even in the field of civil aviation.  We

223
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320

224
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,720
should properly focus on Make in India.  We should make airplanes.  We should have

225
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
companies.  Where we can hold them accountable

226
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
regarding the standards of airplanes.

227
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,800
Because now let me tell you clearly, this

228
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,519
thing has become clear.  It is not the case

229
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,680
that these planes are made in the US or if

230
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,760
some parts come from the US then they

231
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,839
become of very high quality.  Many

232
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,160
Whistle Brokers have confirmed

233
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,320
that these companies are using sub-standard parts in order to earn profits and increase the

234
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,399
valuation of their shares.

235
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,560

236
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
So somewhere there needs

237
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,600
to be an Indian alternative.  If you agree with

238
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,519
me then share your

239
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,959
thoughts in the comment section.  And on this note, the

240
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
video ends.  Thank you for

241
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,480
listening.  And I always say that may the Gods

242
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,160
watch over us and whatever victims are here,

243
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,240
hopefully they survive and there are

244
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,240
no more casualties here.
