Hello, welcome to Career 247. I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, this video is being seen all over the world today. Many people are feeling scared about their flight after watching this video, because the way this Air India flight, a Boeing Dreamliner 787, has crashed in the Indian state of Gujarat. This is horrifying. The visuals that have come out are being seen by the entire world. I have many friends who are in Europe , in the US.  Seeing these visuals, it suddenly came to his mind that there is suddenly anxiety about our flights in the future. Because the way this flight has crashed, no one is able to understand what exactly has happened here. Because if you see the route of this flight, you will be able to see it from Ahmedabad city of Gujarat.  This is Ahmedabad airport. This flight took off from here and its route was London.  This flight was to go to the UK.  It was a long journey.  Now now I will have to mention this here also.  When there is an international journey in a big aircraft, then a lot of fuel is also carried in it.  And suppose such a flight crashes, then since it was carrying a lot of extra fuel, the explosion that occurs is all the more painful.  So right now you are seeing these visuals, you are watching the videos in front of you. If you are wondering how such a big explosion happened?  So see, this flight was going carrying fuel.  That would take it all the way to London.  And if you people here are thinking, wait, this flight was going from Gujarat to UK and it crashed in Gujarat itself. See, this flight suddenly crashes just a short distance away from Ahmedabad airport.  The pilots here had more than 8000 hours of experience. No one understands what happened suddenly that after travelling a short distance this airplane just crashes.  A huge explosion occurs. And the unfortunate thing is that there were a total of 242 passengers in this plane who belonged to different countries. If you look at Air India's Twitter page, everything has been blacked out today.  Profile photo banner everything because this is a big accident.  If I talk about intensity, then this is the biggest air accident in the last 15 years in the history of India. It is possible that this may also become the biggest accident in 25 years if the casualties here cross 150 or 160.  The last time the country saw an airplane disaster of this level was in 2010 when unfortunately 158 people died.  It is not yet confirmed where Air India Flight 171 crashed here in Gujarat. How many people have died here?  But Air India has blacked out its social media handles everywhere.  And below these people have confirmed the nationality of the passengers.  There were 168 Indians here and 53 British nationals here.  Was a Canadian National.  There were seven Portuguese here.  So look at this incident, whatever investigation will be done, most likely UK, Portugal, even Canadian governments may get involved and look online, there are a lot of theories going around today.  Some are saying that it was sabotage.  Something has happened etc. No one knows, until the black box of the plane is found, we will not get proper information about what happened and many people were also asking this question whether former Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani was also present here, so the answer to this is yes, ex-Chief Minister of Gujarat was also here and some reports are claiming that his name is also there in the casualties, again the actual number of how many people have died here is not out yet because many people are also badly injured here and I will also have to tell you that in these images that you are seeing, where did this plane crash ?  This building is a doctor's hostel.  Many people are saying that yes, this was a hospital.  No, a hostel had been built for doctors.  After reaching there, the plane crashed on its roof.  15 doctors who lived here have also been seriously injured.  Again this is a tragedy.  This is perhaps it will be mentioned as one of the biggest tragedies that has happened in the history of India. And the world is also watching this tragedy because this is the first time that Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which is considered to be their best plane, has crashed and these are the images in front of you of the inside of the hostel, where doctors were having their food, some were resting, suddenly a Boeing 787 comes with a lot of fuel and there is a huge blast, people get badly injured, the more I read about this accident the more sad my heart becomes and if we compare this accident with other global disasters, you will note a pattern. Recently, look around the world, many of Boeing's planes have crashed one by one and people have often raised questions on the quality of Boeing airplanes.  Now what has happened in this particular case?  Has something been sabotaged ?  Is there some conspiracy?  Was there some engine fault here?  I will tell you this again.  Don't speculate about this right now. Details of the black box would be being extracted at this time. Very soon we will know what happened here.  But either way this is another crash of a Boeing airplane which has happened within a gap of just a few months. Before this, you will remember that in December 2024, literally on 29th December 2024, there was a South Korean flight Jeju Air 2216 which crashed badly.  94 people lost their lives. Boeing officially offered its condolences, saying what has happened is very bad. Now the actual reason for the crash of this flight has not been revealed till date. Some people say, look, those birds, those ducks, were stuck in the engine. Because of that the engine stopped again and it crashed.  This is very rare and even when the black box was studied, no proper information was found as to why this plane crashed and apart from that, if you observe, in 2024, Boeing's plane constantly remains in the news somewhere or the other.  It is not necessary that every time a G crashes and you know 100-200 people get killed.  Many times this plane suddenly performs a malfunction.  All that is heard in the news is that look, the plane has skidded or some other problem has occurred here.   There was some severe turbulence.  But constantly we are seeing that these instances related to Boeing planes are increasing.  And I would say that it is not a small thing that in the span of just a few months, two big flights, a South Korean flight and now an Indian flight, have crashed and many people have lost their lives here and after this crash in Gujarat, in the times to come you will see that this name John Barnett will be discussed a lot in India. He was a whistle blower.  He worked at Boeing for 30 years as a quality manager. In 2019, he gave an interview to BBC and openly said that all the planes being made in Boeing are standard.  These people use these parts in many places.  These are of very poor quality.  Here you will be able to see these 2019 Barnet Claims that Workers were Forced.  Literally, workers often used to say that the parts we are installing in Boeing 787 are of very poor quality.  There might be a problem tomorrow. Then pressure was put on them to meet the deadline.  Production has to be increased.  The company needs profit.  So somehow by adding crooked parts they sent the Boeing Dream Liner forward for production, you know.  And they had pointed out many issues that the emergency oxygen system in Boeing 787 can fail during the flight.  And Boeing's stock suffered huge losses.  Because of John Bard.  You can say that he caused a loss of millions to Boeing. Now what happens suddenly?  He exposed Boeing.  Suddenly after a few years he gets killed in mysterious circumstances.  Was sitting alone in my house.  He shot himself without any reason and his family has recently filed a case against Boeing.  His family has said that John Barnett was subjected to a sustained campaign of harassment.  There was a resolution when they raised concerns about safety issues, so look at the present time, in India too, the warnings given by John Barnett will be read and studied and perhaps now the time has come that we should also see whether India has an alternative to commercial airlines because if you think about it, we are completely dependent on the western world for our flights, whatever airplanes we have either come from Europe or the US, we do not have any company of our own which can manufacture these airplanes.  China has already started the process of replacing Boeing 737 and other aircraft. Recently their C919 has also passed many tests.  However, it remains to be seen whether they will be able to make a plane that can compete with Boeing or not.  But China is quite clear that it does not want to depend on the US or Europe for its aircraft needs.  So now look, this crash will be studied and evaluated. What happened here? Actually, like in the South Korea case, there have been a lot of bird hits here or was there some engine issue?  I think whatever result comes out here will be in the long term. Even in the field of civil aviation.  We should properly focus on Make in India.  We should make airplanes.  We should have companies.  Where we can hold them accountable regarding the standards of airplanes. Because now let me tell you clearly, this thing has become clear.  It is not the case that these planes are made in the US or if some parts come from the US then they become of very high quality.  Many Whistle Brokers have confirmed that these companies are using sub-standard parts in order to earn profits and increase the valuation of their shares. So somewhere there needs to be an Indian alternative.  If you agree with me then share your thoughts in the comment section.  And on this note, the video ends.  Thank you for listening.  And I always say that may the Gods watch over us and whatever victims are here, hopefully they survive and there are no more casualties here.
