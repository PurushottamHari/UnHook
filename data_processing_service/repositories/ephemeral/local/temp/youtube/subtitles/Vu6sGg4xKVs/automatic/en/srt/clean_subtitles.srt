Are we ready? Okay, let's do this. And action. Let's head over to Notebook LM. This is kind of like a sweeping request for tell me what to do. Give me your best advice based on everything I've given you. Wow. So I often express an intention for work life balance but then what I actually do I I feel that at a deep level coaching can be life-changing but it's also expensive. I found that one of the most important things in good coaching is context. It's important that the coach knows about you, your goals, your opportunities, both your strengths and your weaknesses, how your mind works. Well, we live in a time when AI has an essentially unlimited context window. So, in this video, I'm going to sit down with Notebook LM and load up 40 separate documents containing almost 150,000 words, which is everything that I have and everything that I know about how I work inside. And we're going to find out whether AI can become a coach for you in your life or in your work and exactly how to go about doing that step by step. Let's get into it. Let's talk about the sources that I'm going to be loading up into it. And they fall into three categories. The first one is private notes. Your personal private notes are really one of the best sources. Most people don't have a lot of public writing, don't necessarily do annual reviews, but we all have notes. It might be something as simple as some text from an email you sent a friend in the past or something you've jotted down in your Apple Notes. Notes have this quality of being very honest, very vulnerable because you have no expectation of ever sharing them. And it's perfectly fine if they're messy all over the place with typos. AI can handle all of that and see through all of the messiness and still make use of those notes. So these private notes contain things like all of the notes from my coaching sessions with my human coach over the past few years, images which Notebook LM can now understand. There's a mind map that I update every year with my life goals, my big five personality traits, which I have uh from a survey, and then what's called my time perspective, which is from a book by an author named Zambardo, which is about my relationship to time. I also have a collection of my strengths based on years of customer testimonials that I've collected. I have a compilation of all my gratitude lists, which is something that I do at the end of every year. I just make a big list of everything that I'm thankful for. and also myersbrig profile. And if you're curious how I have all these notes, check out my book and course and membership called Building a Second Brain, which is all about how to create an effective note-taking system. Next, we have my public writing from takeaways from courses I've taken to my experience at Burning Man to summaries of books that I found compelling, writing I've done about sort of my autobiography, my life story, a list of my favorite open questions. So these are all public sources that I've written about different aspects of how I think about life and where I want to go in life and where I've been. And then the third category is also a ritual that I perform at the end of every year which is my yearend review or yearin review. And that's simply a practice that I do every December where I write about what happened that year. What were the high points, the low points, the takeaways, the lessons learned. So you can see I have chosen and linked to the last five years because I want my coach to take that into account and to guide and help me and support me towards achieving those things. So now let's head over to Notebook LM. You'll notice that I'm using the paid version, Notebook LM Plus, which is about $20 per month. And as always, I'm going to start by creating a new project. If you're curious how I'm actually doing this loading up of sources one by one, check out this previous video where I cover that in depth. Now, this is the part that's a little bit timeconuming and we're going to speed through the process of individually selecting each of those sources that I've prepared and loading them up into this project in Notebook LM. Would you be willing and open to load up really some of your most personal sensitive material and introspection to AI? Well, here I am testing it for you to see. All right. Okay. So, that took me about 17 minutes. Uh, definitely took some effort. If you look here in the left side panel, I have about 40 different sources totaling more than 150,000 words. Think about how sci-fi and futuristic this is that I can just sit here and load all this up and now I'm just going to have a conversation drawing on over 150,000 words of my personal context and life story. Just completely mind-blowing. Let's just recognize that fact for a second. The next step here is to start asking questions. Let's head over to the Google doc that I prepared beforehand again. And here I have about 30 questions, many of which actually came from my previous conversations with AI models. You can find a list of the questions that I used in this demonstration at this QR code or in the description below. So let's start with this one right here. So I'll copy that, head over here, paste it into the chat window. So for strengths, it identifies knowledgeable and deep understanding, visionary and futuristic thinking, creativity, being innovative, insightful, and perspective. It's interesting. There's not really any new information here, but what I'm kind of looking for is just to make sure that the AI is working. So let's look at weaknesses. And this is where I'm a little bit nervous to see what it came up with. Self-criticism and perfectionism. That's absolutely true. It notes that that is a common weakness for myersbrig profile which is INFJ. So that kind of oddly makes me feel a bit better that it's kind of characteristic of my personality type. Sensitivity to criticism and conflict. Tendency towards idealism and overlooking details definitely. Um social skills it says is a perceived challenge. That's interesting. So maybe it's not uh based in reality. It's just kind of how I see myself. emotional vulnerability, resistance to emotional processing. Uh specifically when it comes to the past, uh I'd say for sure uh potential for being overly private. I don't know about that one. I tend to share quite a bit publicly. Taking on too much responsibility, fear of being ordinary, uh overthinking and analysis paralysis. I mean, this is the most thorough and I would say accurate list uh of my weaknesses I think I've ever seen. Next, I want to know what have been my recurring challenges or obstacles. So, let's copy that. I'm just going to go ahead and paste that. So, this is interesting. It's a lot of the same things as my weaknesses, but there's also some different things such as fear of failure or fear of not achieving enough. That is not exactly a weakness. It's more like a recurring challenge that comes from the weakness of uh being too self-critical. It's drawing on some of my writing about my personal development that I've done. It's drawing on my coaching notes with my human coach. You'll notice that the first few questions that I asked were sort of just getting a lay of the land, just asking the AI to repeat back to me or to summarize or to distill what it sees in my life story. But now I'm going to sort of make a turn to a different kind of question which is much more subjective and much more interpretive and really draws on things like judgment and even wisdom. So I think this will be the real challenge to see if AI can not just summarize stuff but actually give me advice and point out insights or blind spots that I might not even be aware of myself. Are there any contradictions between my stated intentions such as my goals and what I actually do and the results that I've achieved? Oh boy, here we go. So, based on the sources, there appear to be several contradictions between your stated intentions and your actions or results. Looks like I often express an intention for work life balance, but then what I actually do prioritizes work. Ouch. It's noting that I tend to compartmentalize and derive a lot of joy and creativity from my work, but then have trouble spreading that to other places such as my home and work life. That hurts, but it is definitely accurate. So, despite expressing those intentions throughout several of my annual reviews, I make a clear emphasis on business growth and achievement, often at the expense of personal time and well-being. It does say that later reviews show more awareness and intention in this area. Great. Looks like there's a tension between wanting to delegate, for example, to people on my team, but also difficulty letting go of control. In some cases, even refusing help from others. And that tension leads to this persistent question which I have to this day, which is how to inspire greatness in others without me being directly involved. Looks like I have a tension between uh a desire for financial prudence and keeping spending in check versus being quite a free spender, which I would say is definitely the case. It even has the context to know that that free spending was partly a reaction against my father's frugality, which is pretty deep. There's a tendency between focus and chasing uh shiny objects. There's a tension between wanting sustainable growth but also experiencing burnout, between being present with my family and being distracted by work. So this is again just an excellent uh distillation of I would say most if not all of the key tensions that I keep returning to again both in my work and in my life. Now I'd like to know about blind spots or limiting beliefs. And what I really am going to look at here is if there's anything that I haven't heard of before or I'm not aware of. Interesting that it's now drawing not just on the sources that I loaded up, but our own conversation history, which is mostly things that it has said. So what I assume that means is it can now draw on its previous responses and my previous questions to come up with sort of second order insights. The one thing I'm seeing here that I hadn't considered is that I tend to avoid disappointment. The feeling, the emotion of disappointment, which paradoxically can create more disappointment. So, I'm actually going to highlight that and then save it as a note over here on the right because I want to revisit that a bit later. Something I'm realizing is it's getting a little bit repetitive. It's actually just restating some of the same findings and observations just in different ways, using different language. Let's see what else here could potentially be valuable. Here's a good one. Based on these notes, when have I been the happiest? Uh, this is actually one I think I got from a friend, so it has a little bit more instructions. It says, "Please be specific about moments and situations. Identify what specifically caused the happiness. Be truthful and don't make anything up. And if you find a specific moment of happiness, don't summarize it. Find moments that are surprising. So these are all great tips that you can use in your own conversations with AI. So it's citing a meditation retreat that I went on and specifically day nine. So I experienced waves of pleasure starting throughout my body completely on their own. That's fascinating. So what this is kind of reminding me of is how much meditation is good for me. I've kind of let meditation as a habit fall by the wayside in recent years, but based on this, I think I actually want to bring that back as part of my say morning or evening routine. I'm also seeing some stuff about past uh experiences with psychedelics with iawasa which is kind of reminding me I think I would like to revisit some of that maybe do some psilocybin or MDMA assisted therapy which I know is becoming more and more popular. It's also reminding me of some really beautiful moments with my uh kids when they were babies, as well as how happy I am when I do many consecutive hours of deep reading and writing. It's reminding me how much I love and how much I get from deeply immersive and intentional spaces with fellow entrepreneurs and creators. So, mostly what I'm getting from this is just reminders. You know, I've had a lot of moments in the past that I was deeply satisfied and deeply happy. So maybe it's as simple as just recreating and revisiting some of those same kinds of situations. So here's a really interesting one. What is obvious to everyone around me, but doesn't appear obvious to me? So it suggests that I may be underestimating the team's capabilities. That's one that I want to highlight and save as a note to revisit. It even says the possibility you're already making a significant positive impact. So maybe I should just relax. I mean that's definitely the case. Oh, and interesting. It notes that my kind of attempt to reinvent myself and reinvent my my career and my business that others around me might not clearly see the shift. I had never considered the impact on the people around me of this more or less constant need to reinvent what I'm doing. So I think I'll save that one as well. So what's so interesting about this is at this stage this is so actionable. I can go online and I could do a search for courses or programs or coaches who could help me develop these very specific skills. All right. So this last batch of questions is kind of pivoting from the past and the present which is mostly what we've been talking about. But where coaching is the most powerful where the value is really the clearest is when it comes to the future, future goals, future projects, future decisions, future milestones. So let's dive into some of these questions. Oh, this is one I think about a lot. If I were to regret something at the end of my life, what might that be? So the headline here is not fully prioritizing meaningful relationships and a balanced life and instead overemphasizing work and external achievements at the expense of deeper connections and personal well-being. Wow. So that actually really like hits me. I I feel that at a deep level because this is kind of like the big fear that I that I'm afraid I'll end up with on my deathbed that I made that trade-off between meaningful relationships and balance and work and external achievements on the other hand incorrectly inappropriately. This is kind of the most succinct uh summary or distillation of my I would say my core fear in life that I think I've ever seen. But wow, I kind of want to save this sentence right here in bold for really some deep reflection and processing over what I want to change at this stage, you know, at the midpoint of my life so that I don't end up on my deathbed feeling this way. Next, I'm going to ask based on all my sources, all the questions I've asked in this chat and your responses, what is your best advice for how I should approach goals and challenges in both my personal and professional life? So, this is kind of like a sweeping request for tell me what to do. Give me your best advice based on everything I've talked about and everything I've given you. Interesting. Prioritize self-nowledge and authenticity. Really asking myself, what do I truly want? question the narratives and stories I tell myself. Embrace emotional intelligence and integration. Moving towards areas where you feel shame with curiosity and openness. I think that's advice I've actually given to myself at some point in my writing, but seeing it reflected back is actually helpful. Strive for integration rather than compartmentalization. So, I think I'll save that one because I want to ask more about it. Value relationships and community. Adopt a growth oriented mindset. Embrace vulnerability and imperfection. define enough and prioritize balance. So, what strikes me with these is I think you could give this advice to almost anyone. It's a little bit maybe generic in that sense, but that doesn't mean it's not true and doesn't mean it's not helpful. I think what I would ask of a human coach is to start to go deeper into some of these and really apply them to like my specific circumstances right now. How I'm spending my days, the projects I'm working on, my my just day-to-day circumstances. And the final question is I want to know if there's any question I should have asked. What question did I not ask in our conversation that might yield a novel insight that hasn't come up yet? So I'm specifically asking it for something that hasn't been addressed previously. Interesting. So I've expressed a difference in kind of somatic healing and somatic exploration. So that is a current interest and it's asking what physical sensations so very specifically and recurring bodily experiences might be offering you insights into your current goals, challenges or unagnowledged desires. That is an interesting question. I had never thought to try to tie specific physical sensations directly to insights and takeaways for uh my goals and challenges and unagnowledged desires. So I think I'm just going to copy that question and now ask it. Okay. Wow. So I think this is the most interesting and relevant thing that we've covered so far. Uh and it kind of makes sense. We've kind of explored so many aspects of myself built on things we've talked about before. I asked it which question I should ask and then the AI suggested a question and then I asked that question. So it kind of makes sense that we've arrived essentially at the frontier of my own personal development and my growth as a person. So it's really the specificity of this. It's it's almost like a series of practices or a di again a set of diagnostic criteria that I could look at uh such as tension or tightness in specific areas and it gives some examples of which emotions those might correspond to changes in energy levels, digestive issues which I have been having lately. I had not thought that those could be related to uh things like my psychology and my emotions and even give some examples. Heart related sensations, racing heart, heavy chest, feeling of expansion or warmth, changes in breathing patterns, temperature changes, uh recurring aches or pains which I have been having a few. And it even goes beyond that. you know, if I am wondering how do I actually explore these things or get in touch with them, it suggests a apparently like an existing practice called active body awareness, which I hadn't really heard of before that specifically. And it suggests throughout your day, pause and notice what physical sensations you're experiencing without judgment. And it asks these questions. So, this is an incredibly I mean this list of questions I could I could actually sit down and in five minutes ask one or two of them and um actively bring this thing called active body awareness which I hadn't known about into my routine and into my day. Uh, I could even fire up AI, uh, or talk it over with a human being and actually explore, say, one of these questions in more depth and do kind of like a conversational journaling with something like Notebook LM and thus make it not just an intellectual exercise, which I know based on our conversation is not very effective for me, uh, but actually make it a two-way conversation so that it integrates at a deeper level. And that's it. So, we've spent quite a bit of time here exploring my inner world. I thank you for your patience and being willing to go on that little journey with me. And revisiting my original question, which was, can AI be an effective coach for me, I noticed a couple things. I would say from the level of information and knowledge that it actually performed very very well. In just a matter of a couple hours of preparation plus 15 minutes of loading up those sources into notebook LM, I've done the equivalent of probably 10 or 15 years of context building that would be required with a human. The fact that it can hold in its mind, in its memory, so to speak, such a vast amount of just details, such amount of specifics, even more than I can hold in my head about myself, means that it could pretty effortlessly go from big picture 10,000 ft view perspectives immediately and instantaneously down to the most specific thing I mentioned in one sentence of one article or blog post that I've written. That is something that a human being, a human coach cannot do. What it's not doing so well and really what are some of the most valuable moments with my human coach have to do with the emotions. And often that is something as simple as that human, that person seeing a micro expression on my face, seeing my body language, whether we're working together on Zoom or in person, noticing when I make a pause or when I kind of uh have a certain reaction to something that she said. a lot of that kind of uh subtle or um body language or not explicit information is some of the most valuable information. So I think the way that I would use AI in the future is not as a replacement for a human coach. It's not at the point where it can seamlessly take the place of at least a highly skilled and experienced coach, but I would say it's an excellent compliment. In fact, one of the most useful and commonly cited sources in this conversation was that document with several years of notes from my coaching sessions with my human coach. So, I would say that these two forms of coaching, these two relationships are highly complimentary. They strengthen each other. They make each other better. So, it's not about choosing one or the other. It's about using what AI and technology is really good at alongside and in conjunction with what human beings are good at, which is that personal, relational, and intuitive emotional aspect. I invite you to try this for yourself. You can use any of the AI tools that are now available, including free ones and paid ones. Load up any writing or journal entries or any other material that you have to give it some context. ask it some of the coaching style questions that you saw here. And I would really love it if you shared in the comments below what your experience was and what it came up with. If you'd like to receive more educational content on AI technology generally and many other topics from me, I really encourage you to sign up to our newsletter which goes out every Tuesday morning at this QR code or in the description below. I decided in this video I'm Okay, so this last bast Okay, so this last b last last batch last batch.
