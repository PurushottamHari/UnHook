1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,920
Are we ready?

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,799
Okay, let's do this. And action. Let's

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,400
head over to Notebook LM. This is kind

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,720
of like a sweeping request for tell me

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,160
what to do. Give me your best advice

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,160
based on everything I've given you.

7
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,000
Wow.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,680
So I often express an intention for work

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,280
life balance but then what I actually do

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,280
I I feel that at a deep

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,920
level coaching can be life-changing but

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,760
it's also expensive. I found that one of

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
the most important things in good

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,440
coaching is context. It's important that

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,440
the coach knows about you, your goals,

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,120
your opportunities, both your strengths

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,159
and your weaknesses, how your mind

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,960
works. Well, we live in a time when AI

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,119
has an essentially unlimited context

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,360
window. So, in this video, I'm going to

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,720
sit down with Notebook LM and load up 40

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,000
separate documents containing almost

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,080
150,000 words, which is everything that

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,720
I have and everything that I know about

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,840
how I work inside. And we're going to

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,159
find out whether AI can become a coach

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,400
for you in your life or in your work and

28
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,600
exactly how to go about doing that step

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,079
by step. Let's get into it. Let's talk

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,640
about the sources that I'm going to be

31
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,720
loading up into it. And they fall into

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
three categories. The first one is

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
private notes. Your personal private

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,119
notes are really one of the best

35
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,520
sources. Most people don't have a lot of

36
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,920
public writing, don't necessarily do

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,640
annual reviews, but we all have notes.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,799
It might be something as simple as some

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
text from an email you sent a friend in

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
the past or something you've jotted down

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,280
in your Apple Notes. Notes have this

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
quality of being very honest, very

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,440
vulnerable because you have no

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,599
expectation of ever sharing them. And

45
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,720
it's perfectly fine if they're messy all

46
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,640
over the place with typos. AI can handle

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
all of that and see through all of the

48
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,879
messiness and still make use of those

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,200
notes. So these private notes contain

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,840
things like all of the notes from my

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,480
coaching sessions with my human coach

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,959
over the past few years, images which

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,879
Notebook LM can now understand. There's

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,519
a mind map that I update every year with

55
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,000
my life goals, my big five personality

56
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
traits, which I have uh from a survey,

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
and then what's called my time

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,360
perspective, which is from a book by an

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
author named Zambardo, which is about my

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,920
relationship to time. I also have a

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,239
collection of my strengths based on

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,200
years of customer testimonials that I've

63
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,120
collected. I have a compilation of all

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
my gratitude lists, which is something

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,160
that I do at the end of every year. I

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,879
just make a big list of everything that

67
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,879
I'm thankful for. and also myersbrig

68
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,800
profile. And if you're curious how I

69
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,720
have all these notes, check out my book

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
and course and membership called

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,800
Building a Second Brain, which is all

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,120
about how to create an effective

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,920
note-taking system. Next, we have my

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,000
public writing from takeaways from

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,720
courses I've taken to my experience at

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
Burning Man to summaries of books that I

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,879
found compelling, writing I've done

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
about sort of my autobiography, my life

79
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,640
story, a list of my favorite open

80
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,000
questions. So these are all public

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,000
sources that I've written about

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
different aspects of how I think about

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
life and where I want to go in life and

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,360
where I've been. And then the third

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,599
category is also a ritual that I perform

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,720
at the end of every year which is my

87
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,360
yearend review or yearin review. And

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,599
that's simply a practice that I do every

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
December where I write about what

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,200
happened that year. What were the high

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,439
points, the low points, the takeaways,

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,080
the lessons learned. So you can see I

93
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,640
have chosen and linked to the last five

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,680
years because I want my coach to take

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,439
that into account and to guide and help

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,239
me and support me towards achieving

97
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,400
those things. So now let's head over to

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
Notebook LM. You'll notice that I'm

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,440
using the paid version, Notebook LM

100
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,040
Plus, which is about $20 per month. And

101
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,280
as always, I'm going to start by

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
creating a new project. If you're

103
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,680
curious how I'm actually doing this

104
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,520
loading up of sources one by one, check

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,440
out this previous video where I cover

106
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
that in depth. Now, this is the part

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,360
that's a little bit timeconuming and

108
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,680
we're going to speed through the process

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,919
of individually selecting each of those

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,320
sources that I've prepared and loading

111
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,320
them up into this project in Notebook

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,080
LM. Would you be willing and open to

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,240
load up really some of your most

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,720
personal sensitive material and

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,919
introspection to AI? Well, here I am

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,280
testing it for you to

117
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:58,560
see. All right. Okay. So, that took me

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,479
about 17 minutes. Uh, definitely took

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,960
some effort. If you look here in the

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,400
left side panel, I have about 40

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,199
different sources totaling more than

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,520
150,000 words. Think about how sci-fi

123
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,680
and futuristic this is that I can just

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,680
sit here and load all this up and now

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,800
I'm just going to have a conversation

126
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,680
drawing on over 150,000 words of my

127
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,199
personal context and life story. Just

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,440
completely mind-blowing. Let's just

129
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,919
recognize that fact for a second. The

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,880
next step here is to start asking

131
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,120
questions. Let's head over to the Google

132
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,080
doc that I prepared beforehand again.

133
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,320
And here I have about 30 questions, many

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,639
of which actually came from my previous

135
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,479
conversations with AI models. You can

136
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,039
find a list of the questions that I used

137
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,120
in this demonstration at this QR code or

138
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,360
in the description below. So let's start

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,080
with this one right here. So I'll copy

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,800
that, head over here, paste it into the

141
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,759
chat window. So for strengths, it

142
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,199
identifies knowledgeable and deep

143
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,520
understanding, visionary and futuristic

144
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,600
thinking, creativity, being innovative,

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,360
insightful, and perspective. It's

146
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
interesting. There's not really any new

147
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,800
information here, but what I'm kind of

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,440
looking for is just to make sure that

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
the AI is working. So let's look at

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,039
weaknesses. And this is where I'm a

151
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,240
little bit nervous to see what it came

152
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
up with. Self-criticism and

153
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,759
perfectionism. That's absolutely true.

154
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,960
It notes that that is a common weakness

155
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,039
for myersbrig profile which is INFJ. So

156
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
that kind of oddly makes me feel a bit

157
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,919
better that it's kind of characteristic

158
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,880
of my personality type. Sensitivity to

159
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,319
criticism and conflict. Tendency towards

160
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,479
idealism and overlooking details

161
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,919
definitely. Um social skills it says is

162
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,160
a perceived challenge. That's

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,639
interesting. So maybe it's not uh based

164
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,639
in reality. It's just kind of how I see

165
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,199
myself. emotional vulnerability,

166
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,199
resistance to emotional processing. Uh

167
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,080
specifically when it comes to the past,

168
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
uh I'd say for sure uh potential for

169
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,919
being overly private. I don't know about

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,520
that one. I tend to share quite a bit

171
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,000
publicly. Taking on too much

172
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,000
responsibility, fear of being ordinary,

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,479
uh overthinking and analysis paralysis.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,280
I mean, this is the most thorough and I

175
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,360
would say accurate list uh of my

176
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
weaknesses I think I've ever seen. Next,

177
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,759
I want to know what have been my

178
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,919
recurring challenges or obstacles. So,

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,319
let's copy that. I'm just going to go

180
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,840
ahead and paste that. So, this is

181
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
interesting. It's a lot of the same

182
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,960
things as my weaknesses, but there's

183
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,800
also some different things such as fear

184
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,039
of failure or fear of not achieving

185
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,880
enough. That is not exactly a weakness.

186
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,720
It's more like a recurring challenge

187
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,960
that comes from the weakness of uh being

188
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
too self-critical. It's drawing on some

189
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,720
of my writing about my personal

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,479
development that I've done. It's drawing

191
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
on my coaching notes with my human

192
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,880
coach. You'll notice that the first few

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,520
questions that I asked were sort of just

194
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,080
getting a lay of the land, just asking

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,199
the AI to repeat back to me or to

196
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,319
summarize or to distill what it sees in

197
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,400
my life story. But now I'm going to sort

198
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,280
of make a turn to a different kind of

199
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,919
question which is much more subjective

200
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,080
and much more interpretive and really

201
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,639
draws on things like judgment and even

202
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,280
wisdom. So I think this will be the real

203
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,440
challenge to see if AI can not just

204
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,599
summarize stuff but actually give me

205
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,680
advice and point out insights or blind

206
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,479
spots that I might not even be aware of

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,720
myself. Are there any contradictions

208
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,680
between my stated intentions such as my

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,760
goals and what I actually do and the

210
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,399
results that I've achieved? Oh boy, here

211
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,800
we go. So, based on the sources, there

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,440
appear to be several contradictions

213
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,080
between your stated intentions and your

214
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,839
actions or results. Looks like I often

215
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,720
express an intention for work life

216
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,360
balance, but then what I actually do

217
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,600
prioritizes work. Ouch. It's noting that

218
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
I tend to

219
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,760
compartmentalize and derive a lot of joy

220
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,080
and creativity from my work, but then

221
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,880
have trouble spreading that to other

222
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
places such as my home and work life.

223
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
That hurts, but it is definitely

224
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,040
accurate. So, despite expressing those

225
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,160
intentions throughout several of my

226
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,000
annual reviews, I make a clear emphasis

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,080
on business growth and achievement,

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,160
often at the expense of personal time

229
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,839
and well-being. It does say that later

230
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,680
reviews show more awareness and

231
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,680
intention in this area. Great. Looks

232
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,600
like there's a tension between wanting

233
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,320
to delegate, for example, to people on

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,040
my team, but also difficulty letting go

235
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,440
of control. In some cases, even refusing

236
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,279
help from others. And that tension leads

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,600
to this persistent question which I have

238
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,440
to this day, which is how to inspire

239
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
greatness in others without me being

240
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,480
directly involved. Looks like I have a

241
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,120
tension between uh a desire for

242
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,160
financial prudence and keeping spending

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,839
in check versus being quite a free

244
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,320
spender, which I would say is definitely

245
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,120
the case. It even has the context to

246
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
know that that free spending was partly

247
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
a reaction against my father's

248
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,800
frugality, which is pretty deep. There's

249
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,680
a tendency between focus and chasing uh

250
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,680
shiny objects. There's a tension between

251
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,160
wanting sustainable growth but also

252
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,680
experiencing burnout, between being

253
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,320
present with my family and being

254
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,760
distracted by work. So this is again

255
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,120
just an excellent uh distillation of I

256
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,120
would say most if not all of the key

257
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,839
tensions that I keep returning to again

258
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
both in my work and in my life. Now I'd

259
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,240
like to know about blind spots or

260
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
limiting beliefs. And what I really am

261
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,399
going to look at here is if there's

262
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,320
anything that I haven't heard of before

263
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
or I'm not aware of. Interesting that

264
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
it's now drawing not just on the sources

265
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,640
that I loaded up, but our own

266
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,640
conversation history, which is mostly

267
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,200
things that it has said. So what I

268
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
assume that means is it can now draw on

269
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
its previous responses and my previous

270
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,079
questions to come up with sort of second

271
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,200
order insights. The one thing I'm seeing

272
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,200
here that I hadn't considered is that I

273
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,600
tend to avoid disappointment. The

274
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,519
feeling, the emotion of disappointment,

275
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,240
which paradoxically can create more

276
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,680
disappointment. So, I'm actually going

277
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,600
to highlight that and then save it as a

278
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
note over here on the right because I

279
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
want to revisit that a bit later.

280
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,079
Something I'm realizing is it's getting

281
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,720
a little bit repetitive. It's actually

282
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,279
just restating some of the same findings

283
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
and observations just in different ways,

284
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,760
using different language. Let's see what

285
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
else here could potentially be valuable.

286
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,320
Here's a good one. Based on these notes,

287
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,079
when have I been the happiest? Uh, this

288
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,959
is actually one I think I got from a

289
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,000
friend, so it has a little bit more

290
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,959
instructions. It says, "Please be

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,519
specific about moments and situations.

292
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,680
Identify what specifically caused the

293
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,000
happiness. Be truthful and don't make

294
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,399
anything up. And if you find a specific

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,240
moment of happiness, don't summarize it.

296
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,040
Find moments that are surprising. So

297
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,680
these are all great tips that you can

298
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,480
use in your own conversations with AI.

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,200
So it's citing a meditation retreat that

300
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,680
I went on and specifically day nine. So

301
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,760
I experienced waves of pleasure starting

302
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,360
throughout my body completely on their

303
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,440
own. That's fascinating. So what this is

304
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,839
kind of reminding me of is how much

305
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,920
meditation is good for me. I've kind of

306
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
let meditation as a habit fall by the

307
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
wayside in recent years, but based on

308
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,760
this, I think I actually want to bring

309
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,600
that back as part of my say morning or

310
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,720
evening routine. I'm also seeing some

311
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,279
stuff about past uh experiences with

312
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
psychedelics with iawasa which is kind

313
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,800
of reminding me I think I would like to

314
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,079
revisit some of that maybe do some

315
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,920
psilocybin or MDMA assisted therapy

316
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,760
which I know is becoming more and more

317
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,320
popular. It's also reminding me of some

318
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,880
really beautiful moments with my uh kids

319
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
when they were babies, as well as how

320
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,839
happy I am when I do many consecutive

321
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
hours of deep reading and writing. It's

322
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,079
reminding me how much I love and how

323
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,680
much I get from deeply immersive and

324
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,920
intentional spaces with fellow

325
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,160
entrepreneurs and creators. So, mostly

326
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
what I'm getting from this is just

327
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,720
reminders.

328
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,040
You know, I've had a lot of moments in

329
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,839
the past that I was deeply satisfied and

330
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,320
deeply happy. So maybe it's as simple as

331
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,320
just recreating and revisiting some of

332
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
those same kinds of situations. So

333
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,480
here's a really interesting one. What is

334
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,720
obvious to everyone around me, but

335
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
doesn't appear obvious to me? So it

336
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,959
suggests that I may be underestimating

337
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,200
the team's capabilities. That's one that

338
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,519
I want to highlight and save as a note

339
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,279
to revisit. It even says the possibility

340
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,160
you're already making a significant

341
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,920
positive impact. So maybe I should just

342
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,480
relax. I mean that's definitely the

343
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,880
case. Oh, and interesting. It notes that

344
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,959
my kind of attempt to reinvent myself

345
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,600
and reinvent my my career and my

346
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,760
business that others around me might not

347
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
clearly see the shift. I had never

348
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,399
considered the impact on the people

349
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,399
around me of this more or less constant

350
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,320
need to reinvent what I'm doing. So I

351
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,720
think I'll save that one as well. So

352
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,320
what's so interesting about this is at

353
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,399
this stage this is so actionable. I can

354
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,440
go online and I could do a search for

355
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,680
courses or programs or coaches who could

356
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,040
help me develop these very specific

357
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,680
skills. All right. So this last batch of

358
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,600
questions is kind of pivoting from the

359
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,839
past and the present which is mostly

360
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,399
what we've been talking about. But where

361
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,720
coaching is the most powerful where the

362
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,560
value is really the clearest is when it

363
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,880
comes to the future, future goals,

364
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,120
future projects, future decisions,

365
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,199
future milestones. So let's dive into

366
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,760
some of these questions. Oh, this is one

367
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,760
I think about a lot. If I were to regret

368
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,000
something at the end of my life, what

369
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,040
might that be? So the headline here is

370
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
not fully prioritizing meaningful

371
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,360
relationships and a balanced life and

372
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,920
instead overemphasizing work and

373
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,880
external achievements at the expense of

374
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,320
deeper connections and personal

375
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,120
well-being. Wow.

376
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:11,760
So that actually really like hits me. I

377
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:15,040
I feel that at a deep level because this

378
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,120
is kind of like the big fear that I that

379
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm afraid I'll end up with on my

380
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,720
deathbed that I made that trade-off

381
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,079
between meaningful relationships and

382
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,760
balance and work and external

383
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,639
achievements on the other hand

384
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,680
incorrectly inappropriately. This is

385
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,639
kind of the most succinct

386
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,560
uh summary or distillation of my I would

387
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,720
say my core fear in life that I think

388
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,440
I've ever seen. But wow, I kind of want

389
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,000
to save this sentence right here in bold

390
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,800
for really some deep reflection and

391
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,519
processing over what I want to change at

392
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,519
this stage, you know, at the midpoint of

393
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,079
my life so that I don't end up on my

394
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,880
deathbed feeling this way. Next, I'm

395
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,399
going to ask based on all my sources,

396
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
all the questions I've asked in this

397
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,519
chat and your responses, what is your

398
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,519
best advice for how I should approach

399
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
goals and challenges in both my personal

400
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,720
and professional life? So, this is kind

401
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,959
of like a sweeping request for tell me

402
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,959
what to do. Give me your best advice

403
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,320
based on everything I've talked about

404
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,079
and everything I've given you.

405
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,880
Interesting. Prioritize self-nowledge

406
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,880
and authenticity. Really asking myself,

407
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,959
what do I truly want? question the

408
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,759
narratives and stories I tell myself.

409
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,360
Embrace emotional intelligence and

410
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,360
integration. Moving towards areas where

411
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,040
you feel shame with curiosity and

412
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
openness. I think that's advice I've

413
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,800
actually given to myself at some point

414
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,880
in my writing, but seeing it reflected

415
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,759
back is actually helpful. Strive for

416
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,399
integration rather than

417
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,079
compartmentalization. So, I think I'll

418
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,160
save that one because I want to ask more

419
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,079
about it. Value relationships and

420
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,160
community. Adopt a growth oriented

421
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,399
mindset. Embrace vulnerability and

422
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,560
imperfection. define enough and

423
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,079
prioritize balance. So, what strikes me

424
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
with these is I think you could give

425
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,480
this advice to almost anyone. It's a

426
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,480
little bit maybe generic in that sense,

427
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,079
but that doesn't mean it's not true and

428
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,199
doesn't mean it's not helpful. I think

429
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,000
what I would ask of a human coach is to

430
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,400
start to go deeper into some of these

431
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,880
and really apply them to like my

432
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,799
specific circumstances right now. How

433
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,520
I'm spending my days, the projects I'm

434
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,160
working on, my my just day-to-day

435
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,679
circumstances. And the final question is

436
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,520
I want to know if there's any question I

437
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,160
should have asked. What question did I

438
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,640
not ask in our conversation that might

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,039
yield a novel insight that hasn't come

440
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,960
up yet? So I'm specifically asking it

441
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,280
for something that hasn't been addressed

442
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,280
previously. Interesting. So I've

443
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,080
expressed a difference in kind of

444
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,919
somatic healing and somatic exploration.

445
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,240
So that is a current interest and it's

446
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,039
asking what physical sensations so very

447
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,160
specifically and recurring bodily

448
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,919
experiences might be offering you

449
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
insights into your current goals,

450
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,559
challenges or unagnowledged desires.

451
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,160
That is an interesting question. I had

452
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:05,280
never thought to try to tie specific

453
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,559
physical sensations directly to insights

454
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,880
and takeaways for uh my goals and

455
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,799
challenges and unagnowledged desires. So

456
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,120
I think I'm just going to copy that

457
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:19,480
question and now ask it. Okay. Wow. So I

458
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,559
think this is the most interesting and

459
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,640
relevant thing that we've covered so

460
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,880
far. Uh and it kind of makes sense.

461
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,240
We've kind of explored so many aspects

462
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,960
of myself built on things we've talked

463
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,280
about before. I asked it which question

464
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
I should ask and then the AI suggested a

465
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,039
question and then I asked that question.

466
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,679
So it kind of makes sense that we've

467
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,919
arrived essentially at the frontier of

468
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,240
my own personal development and my

469
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,480
growth as a person. So it's really the

470
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,000
specificity of this. It's it's almost

471
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,559
like a series of practices or a di again

472
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,200
a set of diagnostic criteria that I

473
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,679
could look at uh such as tension or

474
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,160
tightness in specific areas and it gives

475
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,799
some examples of which emotions those

476
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,200
might correspond to changes in energy

477
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,360
levels, digestive issues which I have

478
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,720
been having lately. I had not thought

479
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,039
that those could be related to uh things

480
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
like my psychology and my emotions and

481
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,520
even give some examples. Heart related

482
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,240
sensations, racing heart, heavy chest,

483
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,160
feeling of expansion or warmth, changes

484
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,559
in breathing patterns, temperature

485
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,960
changes, uh recurring aches or pains

486
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,280
which I have been having a few. And it

487
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,440
even goes beyond that. you know, if I am

488
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,600
wondering how do I actually explore

489
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,559
these things or get in touch with them,

490
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,559
it suggests a apparently like an

491
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,640
existing practice called active body

492
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,440
awareness, which I hadn't really heard

493
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,440
of before that specifically. And it

494
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
suggests throughout your day, pause and

495
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,320
notice what physical sensations you're

496
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,880
experiencing without judgment. And it

497
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,880
asks these questions. So, this is an

498
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,640
incredibly I mean this list of questions

499
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,480
I could I could actually sit down and in

500
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:07,120
five minutes ask one or two of them and

501
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,960
um actively bring this thing called

502
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,640
active body awareness which I hadn't

503
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,640
known about into my routine and into my

504
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,200
day. Uh, I could even fire up AI, uh, or

505
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,280
talk it over with a human being and

506
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,280
actually explore, say, one of these

507
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,600
questions in more depth and do kind of

508
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,799
like a conversational journaling with

509
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,960
something like Notebook LM and thus make

510
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,280
it not just an intellectual exercise,

511
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,679
which I know based on our conversation

512
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,840
is not very effective for me, uh, but

513
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,600
actually make it a two-way conversation

514
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,200
so that it integrates at a deeper level.

515
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,080
And that's it. So, we've spent quite a

516
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,640
bit of time here exploring my inner

517
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,000
world. I thank you for your patience and

518
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,000
being willing to go on that little

519
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,960
journey with me. And revisiting my

520
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,760
original question, which was, can AI be

521
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,919
an effective coach for me, I noticed a

522
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,200
couple things. I would say from the

523
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,760
level of information and knowledge that

524
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,000
it actually performed very very well. In

525
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,640
just a matter of a couple hours of

526
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,360
preparation plus 15 minutes of loading

527
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,000
up those sources into notebook LM, I've

528
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,640
done the equivalent of probably 10 or 15

529
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,720
years of context building that would be

530
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,280
required with a human. The fact that it

531
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,159
can hold in its mind, in its memory, so

532
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,039
to speak, such a vast amount of just

533
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,080
details, such amount of specifics, even

534
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,520
more than I can hold in my head about

535
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,880
myself, means that it could pretty

536
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,080
effortlessly go from big picture 10,000

537
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,159
ft view perspectives immediately and

538
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,640
instantaneously down to the most

539
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,360
specific thing I mentioned in one

540
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,720
sentence of one article or blog post

541
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,280
that I've written. That is something

542
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,159
that a human being, a human coach cannot

543
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,760
do. What it's not doing so well and

544
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,400
really what are some of the most

545
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,280
valuable moments with my human coach

546
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,919
have to do with the emotions. And often

547
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,480
that is something as simple as that

548
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,080
human, that person seeing a micro

549
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,440
expression on my face, seeing my body

550
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,320
language, whether we're working together

551
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,600
on Zoom or in person, noticing when I

552
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,440
make a pause or when I kind of uh have a

553
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,000
certain reaction to something that she

554
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:29,280
said. a lot of that kind of uh subtle or

555
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,400
um body language or not explicit

556
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,760
information is some of the most valuable

557
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,400
information. So I think the way that I

558
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,039
would use AI in the future is not as a

559
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,679
replacement for a human coach. It's not

560
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,799
at the point where it can seamlessly

561
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,360
take the place of at least a highly

562
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,120
skilled and experienced coach, but I

563
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,760
would say it's an excellent compliment.

564
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,880
In fact, one of the most useful and

565
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,640
commonly cited sources in this

566
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,120
conversation was that document with

567
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,080
several years of notes from my coaching

568
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,919
sessions with my human coach. So, I

569
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
would say that these two forms of

570
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,000
coaching, these two relationships are

571
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
highly complimentary. They strengthen

572
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,360
each other. They make each other better.

573
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,000
So, it's not about choosing one or the

574
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,799
other. It's about using what AI and

575
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,720
technology is really good at alongside

576
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,799
and in conjunction with what human

577
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,520
beings are good at, which is that

578
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,919
personal, relational, and intuitive

579
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,000
emotional aspect. I invite you to try

580
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,159
this for yourself. You can use any of

581
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,400
the AI tools that are now available,

582
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,880
including free ones and paid ones. Load

583
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,120
up any writing or journal entries or any

584
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,280
other material that you have to give it

585
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,200
some context. ask it some of the

586
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,880
coaching style questions that you saw

587
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,039
here. And I would really love it if you

588
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,559
shared in the comments below what your

589
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,760
experience was and what it came up with.
