00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello Friends.  Friends, is there going to be

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,160
a big change in Iran after the US attack

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,559
?  Because the supreme

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,639
leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is currently

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,200
hiding in a bunker.  Obviously, there is a

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,040
huge threat of assassination on him

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,119
and keeping this in mind,

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,119
he has also suggested three names who

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
could be his successors.  But the

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,199
most interesting thing in this is that he did

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,600
not take the name of his son.  What I mean to say is that for a

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
long time there was speculation

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,400
that the next supreme leader of Iran

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,239
could be Ali Khamenei's son,

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,559
but he has tried to make a move in a very strategic

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,280
manner and

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,399
you can see this in the news Iran Khamenei Living in

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,800
Bunker Names Three Possible Successors as well as what is

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,120
Israel's effort here, at

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,879
present Israel wants a permanent solution

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,960
so that Iran

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,440
cannot make nuclear weapons even in future, so here

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,440
a lot of news and talks were also going on about regime change,

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,960
so combining all that, I will

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
tell you about it in detail in the video.

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,120
Let's move on.  But

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,960
also given in the comment section.  Let's get

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,720
started.  The first question is

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
what is happening?  Look, a

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,799
report has been published here in which it is being said

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,000
that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,079
Ali Khamenei is currently

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
hiding in the Heli Fortified Underground Bunker and his

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,399
entire communication has been cut off.

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
Somehow this shows

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,079
that a very critical and

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
unexpected escalation has taken place in the entire

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,320
Middle East crisis.  And this

55
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,200
development underscores

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,520
that there is an atmosphere of fear at the moment and

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,119
somewhere a major assassination can be attempted over khaini.

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,000
Because just

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,320
think, if America

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,720
can use B2 bomber and attack the nuclear plant in Fado, then no matter

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,280

62
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,520
how much Khamenei is hiding in the bunker here, there

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,760
are high chances of an attack on him too.

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
Aldo is said to be quite low.  I will

65
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
tell you about it.  But the question is

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,200
why are all these things happening now?

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,800
As you all know, the Israel-

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
Iran war was going on here.

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Israel was repeatedly saying that Iran

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,879
should not acquire nuclear weapons.  Iran

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,959
also retaliated.  All these things were going on.

72
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,360
Then suddenly it was known yesterday,

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,920
whether yesterday or just this morning, that

74
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,640
several

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,879
locations in Iran, including three nuclear sites, were

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,440
attacked through B2 stealth bomber.  Now what

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,080
is the central role of Khamenei at this time?   He is the

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,800
Supreme Leader of Iran and Khamenei

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,280
currently has absolute authority.  Kheme can put forward his views on everything like military,

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,080
intelligence, judiciary, foreign policy.

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,560
So his

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
removal would mean his death or

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,120
assassination, which could create a power vacuum in Iran.

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,760

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
Due to which there can be a lot of instability during war time in the Islamic Republic i.e. Iran.

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,400

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,239
And this same effort might be being made at this

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,640
time somewhere or the other

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,560
by Israel and the US.  Well,

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
what is this bunker about, exactly, a

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,239
report has been published in The Times, in which it is being

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
said

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,959
that Khamenei has been relocated to

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,519
a secure underground facility and

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,760
where, basically in Tehran itself, that is, Tehran which is the

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,480
capital of Iran, there is a

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
district there and the name of the place is Levijan,

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,319
I will show you this Tehran, if you

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,799
see this entire city, here

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,360
you will see the airport of Tehran, Mehrabad

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,000
International Airport and

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,640
if you look at its North East side, then there

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,680
is a district here, Lavizan.  It is being told there

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,799
that multiple blast doors have been installed very deep, 100 meters underground,

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,519

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,159
so that even if a B2 bomber attacks,

107
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,879
it will not have any impact.  Meaning, an attempt has been made to keep the

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,439
tobacco here in a completely secure manner

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,280
and complete surveillance is being carried out

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,680
through drones and anti-air

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
defence systems so that no

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
assassination or attempt is made on them.  Apart from

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
this, see what

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
happens, in most of the cases, when there is communication, then

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
in that case

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
their exact location is known, so here all the

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
digital and electronic communication has been

118
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
stopped and it is also being

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
told here that the military commanders are

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,960

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,400
communicating with Khamenei through a single trusted courier, which

122
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,880
means that instead of through electronic channels,

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,880

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,759
efforts are being made to do things through a courier person,

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,639
so that the NSA, or the Mossad,

126
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,560
cannot intercept them here.  So

127
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,639
you will get to see this at this time.  In fact, it is being

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
said that there is an elite ultra

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,280
secret unit inside Iran which is

130
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
not answerable to the IRGC.  You

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,440
all know that IRGC protects the entire Iran.

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
So, they too are not answerable.  In a

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
way, he is protecting Khamenei.   In

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
fact, even many senior military commanders do

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
not know their locations.

136
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
And as far as the messages being given to the public are concerned,

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,840
they are being told that these are

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,240
pre-recorded messages.  Meaning, he is

139
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
showing to the public that we are us and

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
all the decisions are being taken at this time.

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
But actually these are all pre-recorded

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,479
videos which are being published.

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,880
Now the question here is

144
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,960
why is Khamenei facing such a big threat of assassination?

145
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,440
Look, in the past too Israel has

146
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,199
killed the top most leaders of Iran.

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
For example, you all might know that the

148
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,759
senior most Iranian official, Qasim

149
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,080
Soleimani, was killed with the help of the US.

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,639
Apart from this, the top most nuclear

151
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,560
scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was also

152
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,720
killed here.  So it is obvious that

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,960
Khamenei would be the top most target of

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Israel and US at this time and somewhere or the other the

155
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,680
green light would have been given so that

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
Khamenei could be killed here.  There were

157
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
also reports that

158
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Israel was ready to attack.  The locations were

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
known but the US vetoed it.  The

160
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,600
US in a way refused to tell

161
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,639
Israel that this could lead to a major

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
repercussion.  Well if you

163
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
look here, the posture of the US and its

164
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,280
intelligence reach will make you understand

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,199
that America can go to some extent.

166
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
Because after the bombing today, what Donald Trump

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,840

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
said in the morning was that from here we can launch even bigger attacks on

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
Iran if Iran does

170
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,240
not stop here.  You will see many cyber attacks, drone

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,240
capabilities and many other things during this time.

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,319
Then another thing besides this is the

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
domestic problem that is going on inside Iran itself.  The

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,160
entire

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,080
economy of Iran is in danger at the moment.   It

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,440
is collapsing.  There might also be protests

177
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
due to all these things because

178
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,120
ultimately how long will people wait?

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,120
Unemployment will increase.

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
If people don't have enough food to eat twice then

181
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
this can create a problem somewhere and

182
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,280
due to foreign strike an

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,160
internal revolt can happen here.  So in a way,

184
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,319
removing Khamenei could also be a major motive of the

185
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
US and Israel and in fact, if

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
you see, recently I also made a video

187
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,319
and told you that the

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
end game of Israel is most likely

189
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,720
regime change.  I mean look, in a way,

190
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,319
what is Israel showing as an external, stated goal

191
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
?  This is what we are telling the entire world that

192
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
we want Iran

193
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,440
not to acquire nuclear capability.  Could not make a nuclear bomb.

194
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,919
But you will

195
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
clearly see the unstated goal that Israel wants

196
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
that the entire structure that is there at present, that is, the

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,680
Islamic Republic of Iran, should be

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
removed.  This supreme leader

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,160
President means that efforts should be made to democratize it.

200
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,080
Because if you see,

201
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
recently a message from Netan Yau came

202
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,919
to the Iranian people.  Meaning there is a war going on.

203
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
Do you think that during a war the

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,000
leader of one country will address the people of another country here?

205
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,599
What is the reason behind it?

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Watch Netanyahu tell the people of Iran to

207
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,400
Stand Up for Your Freedom from the

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Evil and Oppressive Regime.  Meaning, this

209
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,919
statement was not just rhetoric.

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,919
Meaning, somewhere

211
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,919
in Iran, an

212
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,240
attempt was being made to exploit the domestic dissatisfaction so that

213
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,080
you go for regime change.  You make a big

214
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
change and

215
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,479
Israel may also benefit from it, so that perhaps

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,039
a permanent solution may be found here.

217
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,280
Anyway, we have talked about

218
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,520
what things can happen now.  But the big

219
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,520
news that has come is that now assume that

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,840
something can happen with Khamenei on tomorrow's date.  So

221
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,240
how will continuity be maintained in that case?

222
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,000
So there should be a successor.  So it is being

223
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
said here that Khamenei has

224
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,919
given written instructions to the Assembly of

225
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,319
Experts.  Who are these assembly experts

226
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,560
?  This is basically the Clair

227
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,120
Clerical Council which is in Iran, in fact,

228
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,120
if you see, here an attempt has been made to create the entire

229
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,520
institution structure type.

230
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840

231
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,479
Iran's Clerical Council plays a very important role in this

232
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,800
and it picks the Supreme

233
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,879
Leader and let's say somewhere or the other, if

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
he dies because he is quite old now.  He

235
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360

236
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,519
is 86 years old now.  So in that case he has suggested three names.

237
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,919
Now look, the names of all three have

238
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,599
not been disclosed publicly.  Unnamed

239
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,440
, he is mentioned to the clerics.  The

240
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,040
clerics can sit in tomorrow's court and

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,800
decide who among them should be selected.

242
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,120
But, the very important thing in this is

243
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,920
that for a long time it has been speculated

244
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,560
that Khamenei's son Mustafa

245
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,120
Khamenei could perhaps be made the next Supreme

246
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,519
Leader Aitullah here.  But

247
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,519
his name is not in this list.  This has been

248
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
said to be confirmed.  So, in a way, an

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,200
attempt may be being made to give the signal that the

250
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,240
hard liners and moderates in Iran are being

251
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,480
appeased.  Meaning,

252
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
here we do not play dynastic politics

253
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,040
i.e. hereditary politics

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,040
and here only the able leader will be

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,440

256
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,519
tried to be made the supreme leader.  Well, overall

257
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
what could be the implication of all this?  The

258
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,800
first geopolitical implication is that there would be a potential

259
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,040
leadership vacuum, meaning if Khavenni dies,

260
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
then in that case you could see a power struggle like that in Iran.   There

261
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,120

262
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,120

263
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120

264
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,279
might be a big fight somewhere amongst the generals, reformists and clerics of IRGC.  And because of this there may be

265
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
a civil unrest and somewhere or the other an

266
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,480

267
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,640
opportunity for foreign intervention which may be available to Israel and the US.

268
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,399
Then the second thing is that the war

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,640
can escalate further from here.  Suppose if the

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,040
supreme leader is assassinated then it

271
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,519
is obvious that Iran is not going to sit quiet.  In

272
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,600
fact, what happened yesterday and this morning

273
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,279
also carries a huge danger.  But

274
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,279
things can escalate from here.

275
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,880
Hezbollah and all the

276
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,720
proxies here who believe in the Supreme

277
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,800
Leader will come here and fight the entire war.

278
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,560
And India's concern is, as far as

279
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,160
India looks at it, ultimately for India, the protection of our

280
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,760
citizens who live in the Gulf,

281
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
in the Middle East, is very

282
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,279
important.  We have

283
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,360
started the evacuation and at the same time India will

284
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,120
remain neutral as it has always been the case.

285
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
So let's see what happens next regarding this.

286
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
But I hope that

287
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
you have understood the meaning of the news that was coming.

288
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,680
And before I go, a very

289
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,839
interesting question.  What can you tell me?

290
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,240
Which of the following best describes the

291
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
political system of Iran?  Which of the following

292
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,760
correctly describes Iran's

293
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,519
political system?  And

294
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,800
you all know that the right answer to this can be found on my Instagram,
