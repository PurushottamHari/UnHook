Hello Friends.  Friends, is there going to be a big change in Iran after the US attack ?  Because the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is currently hiding in a bunker.  Obviously, there is a huge threat of assassination on him and keeping this in mind, he has also suggested three names who could be his successors.  But the most interesting thing in this is that he did not take the name of his son.  What I mean to say is that for a long time there was speculation that the next supreme leader of Iran could be Ali Khamenei's son, but he has tried to make a move in a very strategic manner and you can see this in the news Iran Khamenei Living in Bunker Names Three Possible Successors as well as what is Israel's effort here, at present Israel wants a permanent solution so that Iran cannot make nuclear weapons even in future, so here a lot of news and talks were also going on about regime change, so combining all that, I will tell you about it in detail in the video. Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that if you want to prepare for UPSC 2026, you can join the Pratigya Batch, which is the foundation batch of Study IQ.

The first question is what is happening?  Look, a report has been published here in which it is being said that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is currently hiding in the Heli Fortified Underground Bunker and his entire communication has been cut off. Somehow this shows that a very critical and unexpected escalation has taken place in the entire Middle East crisis.  And this development underscores that there is an atmosphere of fear at the moment and somewhere a major assassination can be attempted over khaini. Because just think, if America can use B2 bomber and attack the nuclear plant in Fado, then no matter how much Khamenei is hiding in the bunker here, there are high chances of an attack on him too. Aldo is said to be quite low.  I will tell you about it.  But the question is why are all these things happening now? As you all know, the Israel- Iran war was going on here. Israel was repeatedly saying that Iran should not acquire nuclear weapons.  Iran also retaliated.  All these things were going on. Then suddenly it was known yesterday, whether yesterday or just this morning, that several locations in Iran, including three nuclear sites, were attacked through B2 stealth bomber.  Now what is the central role of Khamenei at this time?   He is the Supreme Leader of Iran and Khamenei currently has absolute authority.  Kheme can put forward his views on everything like military, intelligence, judiciary, foreign policy. So his removal would mean his death or assassination, which could create a power vacuum in Iran. Due to which there can be a lot of instability during war time in the Islamic Republic i.e. Iran. And this same effort might be being made at this time somewhere or the other by Israel and the US.  Well, what is this bunker about, exactly, a report has been published in The Times, in which it is being said that Khamenei has been relocated to a secure underground facility and where, basically in Tehran itself, that is, Tehran which is the capital of Iran, there is a district there and the name of the place is Levijan, I will show you this Tehran, if you see this entire city, here you will see the airport of Tehran, Mehrabad International Airport and if you look at its North East side, then there is a district here, Lavizan.  It is being told there that multiple blast doors have been installed very deep, 100 meters underground, so that even if a B2 bomber attacks, it will not have any impact.  Meaning, an attempt has been made to keep the tobacco here in a completely secure manner and complete surveillance is being carried out through drones and anti-air defence systems so that no assassination or attempt is made on them.  Apart from this, see what happens, in most of the cases, when there is communication, then in that case their exact location is known, so here all the digital and electronic communication has been stopped and it is also being told here that the military commanders are communicating with Khamenei through a single trusted courier, which means that instead of through electronic channels, efforts are being made to do things through a courier person, so that the NSA, or the Mossad, cannot intercept them here.  So you will get to see this at this time.  In fact, it is being said that there is an elite ultra secret unit inside Iran which is not answerable to the IRGC.  You all know that IRGC protects the entire Iran. So, they too are not answerable.  In a way, he is protecting Khamenei.   In fact, even many senior military commanders do not know their locations. And as far as the messages being given to the public are concerned, they are being told that these are pre-recorded messages.  Meaning, he is showing to the public that we are us and all the decisions are being taken at this time. But actually these are all pre-recorded videos which are being published. Now the question here is why is Khamenei facing such a big threat of assassination? Look, in the past too Israel has killed the top most leaders of Iran. For example, you all might know that the senior most Iranian official, Qasim Soleimani, was killed with the help of the US. Apart from this, the top most nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was also killed here.  So it is obvious that Khamenei would be the top most target of Israel and US at this time and somewhere or the other the green light would have been given so that Khamenei could be killed here.  There were also reports that Israel was ready to attack.  The locations were known but the US vetoed it.  The US in a way refused to tell Israel that this could lead to a major repercussion.  Well if you look here, the posture of the US and its intelligence reach will make you understand that America can go to some extent. Because after the bombing today, what Donald Trump said in the morning was that from here we can launch even bigger attacks on Iran if Iran does not stop here.  You will see many cyber attacks, drone capabilities and many other things during this time. Then another thing besides this is the domestic problem that is going on inside Iran itself.  The entire economy of Iran is in danger at the moment.   It is collapsing.  There might also be protests due to all these things because ultimately how long will people wait? Unemployment will increase. If people don't have enough food to eat twice then this can create a problem somewhere and due to foreign strike an internal revolt can happen here.  So in a way, removing Khamenei could also be a major motive of the US and Israel and in fact, if you see, recently I also made a video and told you that the end game of Israel is most likely regime change.  I mean look, in a way, what is Israel showing as an external, stated goal ?  This is what we are telling the entire world that we want Iran not to acquire nuclear capability.  Could not make a nuclear bomb. But you will clearly see the unstated goal that Israel wants that the entire structure that is there at present, that is, the Islamic Republic of Iran, should be removed.  This supreme leader President means that efforts should be made to democratize it. Because if you see, recently a message from Netan Yau came to the Iranian people.  Meaning there is a war going on. Do you think that during a war the leader of one country will address the people of another country here? What is the reason behind it? Watch Netanyahu tell the people of Iran to Stand Up for Your Freedom from the Evil and Oppressive Regime.  Meaning, this statement was not just rhetoric. Meaning, somewhere in Iran, an attempt was being made to exploit the domestic dissatisfaction so that you go for regime change.  You make a big change and Israel may also benefit from it, so that perhaps a permanent solution may be found here. Anyway, we have talked about what things can happen now.  But the big news that has come is that now assume that something can happen with Khamenei on tomorrow's date.  So how will continuity be maintained in that case? So there should be a successor.  So it is being said here that Khamenei has given written instructions to the Assembly of Experts.  Who are these assembly experts ?  This is basically the Clair Clerical Council which is in Iran, in fact, if you see, here an attempt has been made to create the entire institution structure type. Iran's Clerical Council plays a very important role in this and it picks the Supreme Leader and let's say somewhere or the other, if he dies because he is quite old now.  He is 86 years old now.  So in that case he has suggested three names. Now look, the names of all three have not been disclosed publicly.  Unnamed , he is mentioned to the clerics.  The clerics can sit in tomorrow's court and decide who among them should be selected. But, the very important thing in this is that for a long time it has been speculated that Khamenei's son Mustafa Khamenei could perhaps be made the next Supreme Leader Aitullah here.  But his name is not in this list.  This has been said to be confirmed.  So, in a way, an attempt may be being made to give the signal that the hard liners and moderates in Iran are being appeased.  Meaning, here we do not play dynastic politics i.e. hereditary politics and here only the able leader will be tried to be made the supreme leader.  Well, overall what could be the implication of all this?  The first geopolitical implication is that there would be a potential leadership vacuum, meaning if Khavenni dies, then in that case you could see a power struggle like that in Iran.   There might be a big fight somewhere amongst the generals, reformists and clerics of IRGC.  And because of this there may be a civil unrest and somewhere or the other an opportunity for foreign intervention which may be available to Israel and the US. Then the second thing is that the war can escalate further from here.  Suppose if the supreme leader is assassinated then it is obvious that Iran is not going to sit quiet.  In fact, what happened yesterday and this morning also carries a huge danger.  But things can escalate from here. Hezbollah and all the proxies here who believe in the Supreme Leader will come here and fight the entire war. And India's concern is, as far as India looks at it, ultimately for India, the protection of our citizens who live in the Gulf, in the Middle East, is very important.  We have started the evacuation and at the same time India will remain neutral as it has always been the case. So let's see what happens next regarding this. But I hope that you have understood the meaning of the news that was coming. And before I go, a very interesting question.  What can you tell me?
