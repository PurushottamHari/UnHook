I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, Iran's nuclear program has not been completely destroyed. Why I am saying this, I will tell you in three points.  Is it okay?  So we will talk about it very closely because see, the entire American Pentagon made a plan as to how Operation Midnight Hammer ultimately happened.  Decoy means a lot of planes had gone.  Which was the real plane ?  Nobody knows at all.  Then as soon as we entered the airspace, a lot of Tomac missiles were fired.  So, we will talk about this very thoroughly.  But before that, let me tell you friends that our Chanakya Niti Personality Development course is live.  It is only â‚¹500.  You can fix this. So brother, look, blow up this nuclear facility, blow it up, blow it up. So the Fordo Nuclear Facility and after that the Nathans and the Swahan nuclear facilities have been attacked. Bushehr has been attacked again.  It is approximately 100 km from Tairan.  It is at a distance of. Com City is right next to here.  It is a very religious city.  This is considered to be the stronghold of religious clerics and religious gurus. So there has been an attack there. Now friends, here is Mohammad Ismail who is a professor.  Isn't it? University of Mines and Nuclear Technology in Iran.  So he tells that brother, look, first of all they have attacked with their B52 and the bunker buster bomb MOP, but Iran's Fordow facility, both these facilities are out of order, so nothing is happening here, now it is okay, this is out of order, you can assume that there is nothing here, but this Fourow facility that Iran has built, no one knows how deep it is, some say 100 meters below, some say 80 meters below, some say 100 meters below, some say 700 meters below, nobody knows. Now, the Israeli bomb can go down to a depth of 10 meters.  But America's bomb can go down to 60 meters.  So now this is where the catch comes.  Iran won't know. Look, this nuclear program is not running from today.  And this fight is not going on from today.  It has been going on for 5 years that Iran will make a nuclear bomb.  Iran also knows that America has a nuclear buster bomb.  This is a bunker buster bomb which will explode after reaching the bottom.  So, would Iran not know this and would it not have built this nuclear facility very deep down keeping all this in mind? There is a high possibility that they know what technologies America has and that Russia, Iran, Russia, China help them with all this.  Okay, so everyone knows how far and how low Bombay can go.  So that is why it is being said that perhaps the damage has not been that much. I found the third point the most important.  But talking about the second point, yesterday their Iranian Foreign Ministry said that you cannot bomb knowledge, which was a very good statement.  Now see, what has happened here is that Iran's nuclear program is not running from today. Iran is following the footsteps of North Korea.  North Korea also signed the NPT.  Is it okay?  But after that, whenever America would hit, it would call it a slap.  Oh sorry sorry Maharaj, we have made a big mistake.  We are working according to your wishes. But in 2006, North Korea said that it has a nuclear bomb and in 2017, it has conducted six nuclear tests so far and North Korea is said to have 60 to 70 bombs. So now if Donald Trump had not made this nuclear bomb, then Donald Trump would have killed North Korea.  But because they have nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles.  So he said let's talk.  So you must have seen the photo that Donald Trump is walking hand in hand with the chubby Kim Jong-un. So, this program of theirs is not running from today. Now look, in Iran, there is a very large section of the society which is very intelligent.  Look, what happened to the Arabs including the Persians?  He came to India.  He acquired knowledge from India.  So after that he went and developed science there.  Scientific Tepononapate is highly regarded.   I am not talking about the village, the people in the city, the educated people, among them there are many Algebra and Chemists, which means there is a book. Ok?  Now this is algebra and whatever AL you know, basically all this has come from this region.  Now he went after learning from India. Now India never did marketing.  Knowledge is never marketed.  And he has also said that it is written in his books that yes, it has been taken from India. He publicly said that this was published by Europe and Europe has always been far ahead in branding marketing.  So what I mean to say is that there is a scientific temperament there and in Iran, because there is talk of nuclear program.  There is a regime there and that too is a strict regime.  So the focus there is on the cream of Iran.  Is it okay ?  He should be employed in this nuclear programme. This knowledge should be transferred to them. So basically, an army of scientists is standing there with the knowledge that it doesn't matter if you have exploded this nuclear program here, explode it, we will make it again, we have so much knowledge, we are short of mountains, we will make it again, you will keep getting tired while fighting, uproot whatever you want to uproot and the third most valid point is bhaiya, two days ago a journalist is telling that trucks have been given, all the material that was there in the trucks, has been taken out and shifted to another place.  And friends, this makes sense, this is the strongest point.  Why is it?  Donald Trump is shouting that he will attack.  Donald Trump is saying that we will attack in two weeks.  I knew that the day Israel leaves, everyone carries this backup plan for two-three months. You will go.  Suppose if you were the Prime Minister of Iran or the Supreme Leader of Iran, would you not think that what would you do if Israel attacks ?  So we will have to have a backup plan for that as well.  So keep all the trucks and everything in ready state. Choose an entire site and shift everything there. So it is being said that Iran has already shifted all the things that are here to another place. So who did America kill again ?  Empty rooms or tunnels? Because see, you have shown these images from the satellite that all this has been destroyed.  But this is not revealed from anywhere because you are not sitting there to see whether their nuclear materials were destroyed or not. So this is a very big thing that they have already shifted everything.  Now what do you think, tell me in the comment box. But this reason makes a lot of sense to me.  So, that's it.  Rest you can avail our courses.  Now see, this war is here, it could turn next. Now see, Iran will not survive.  America is powerful.  And if Iran attacks, the State of Hormos will be blocked.  So as America is saying that it will be economic suicide.  This will become very dangerous. Well, only time will tell.  But dangerous escalation is happening.  We will see whatever happens.
