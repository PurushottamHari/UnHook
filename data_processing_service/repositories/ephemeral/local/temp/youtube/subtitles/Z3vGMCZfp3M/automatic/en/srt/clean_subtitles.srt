Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, ever since the meeting between Asim Munir and Donald Trump, a lot of details have come to light. Firstly, I have noted one thing that today the people of Afghanistan are criticizing the government of Pakistan and its military. Till date, I have probably not seen such criticism even from Indians. In this photo, you can see a collage of images posted by many Afghans on social media that how over the years, whichever army general of Pakistan has been there, be it Rahil Sharif Bajwa or Musharraf, all of them were indirectly working for the US and you will find many of their assets in Western countries, primarily in the US and the UK and therefore many Afghans have written that the greatest betrayer of Islam is the government of Pakistan and recently Asim Munir has met Donald Trump here, it is confirmed that the USA wants Pakistan's airspace, its military bases, whatever the US wants to do in Iran in the coming weeks, the US wants Pakistan's full cooperation in that and if you are asking me this here, but what does the US want to do, see, the US media itself is reporting that Donald Trump is also looking at tactical nuclear weapons, a video of this went viral recently, according to me, this is the biggest development so far that Iran's nuclear program will be completely ended.  For this, the US can use a tactical nuclear weapon to destroy whatever progress Iran has made in uranium enrichment through center fuses.  Please watch this small clip.  You will be able to see this in this video. Bunkeringical but White House thing on the table even tactical news now here you have to understand that they are saying that Iran's nuclear program and according to the US, the supreme leader of Iran is underground, so to hit there, they can use bunker buster bombs, about which there is no 100% certainty whether this will work or not and hence the talks are going on about tactical nuclear weapons because Donald Trump has made one thing clear.  They do not want American soldiers to go to Iran themselves. Destroy everything yourself.  They don't want American boots on the ground, so here's a solution called this tactical nuclear weapon, a small nuclear weapon. Now watch again as I deliver this news. When I tell you the perspective of some Pakistanis in the American media, they get angry and attack me. Look, I am not doing all this. If this thing is entering your mind a little. I am just telling you what is happening. I am not Trump.  I don't take decisions.  I am just telling you all what is happening here.  Now it is obvious that Pakistan does not want to get involved in all this at all. All this is a very bad situation for Pakistan that the US will attack.  Here Iran will have to support Pakistan.  The way USA attacked Afghanistan. Pakistan had to be supported.  Now look, Asim Munir has clearly told Donald Trump one thing that militancy will increase a lot in Balochistan.  That Balochistan could slip out of Pakistan's hands if the Israel-Iran conflict continues in this manner.  Because you have to understand that if we look at the world map, when we say Balochistan, Balochistan is not only in Pakistan.  Balochistan was once a whole region, which is now divided.  A little bit of Balochistan is also in Afghanistan. Much of Balochistan is in Iran and Balochistan is also in Pakistan.  If I say that Baloch people should get their own country, then Pakistan's land will be lost in it.  A little bit of southern area of ​​Afghanistan and a lot of area of ​​Iran will go away and then a Balochistan will be formed.  And the freedom fighters of Balochistan who want a country named Balochistan to be formed again, Republic of Balochistan, they are often talking about this type of country. Now Asif Munir has clearly told Donald Trump that if Iran's military is destroyed. These people bring about a coup in Iran. Everything changes in Iran.  In that case, there are many groups of Baloch militants who are today in Balochistan of Iran, Balochistan of Pakistan.  They can capture Balochistan in Iran and after that they can influence the Balochistan in Pakistan as well.  And after that, the government of Pakistan, the military of Pakistan would not be able to handle that situation because there would be cross border militancy happening there.  The Balochistan Liberation Army which is in Pakistan must be getting huge support from Iran.  Of Baloch militants and as far as I have been able to see articles of US experts, vlogs, the USA has no interest, no concern in whether Pakistan is able to hold on to Balochistan or not.  They don't care.  At this moment Donald Trump is seeing one thing. His legacy What did I say?  His legacy.  Tell Trump that this is most likely his last term.  After this, the process of becoming President again is very complicated.  He says that he will try. But again, I don't think he will be able to become President for the third time after this because the US Constitution does not allow it and it doesn't seem in the Constitution that changes can be made after the mid-term elections.  So Trump knows that the way future generations will judge Trump, this part of Trump's foreign policy regarding Iran will matter a lot.  Will Trump be the President who will use nuclear weapon on foreign soil for the first time in several decades after Harry Truman and let me tell you this, as soon as Trump drops a tactical nuclear warhead on Iran or I say topples Iran, overthrows the government here, after that we do not know which new Iran will emerge.  These experiments of USA have gone very wrong in Libya. You might remember that once upon a time ISIS had emerged in Iraq. So after whatever the US is going to do in Iran, which new Iran will emerge? We do not know anything can happen.  And that is why Donald Trump is taking maximum time. He said I need two more weeks.  I am evaluating.   I am seeing what can happen. This is what Trump hopes here, too.  There should be a ceasefire.   The next President after me should handle this problem.  All these difficulties and hardships are being fought.  But Asim Muran has clearly said that we will help you. We will take the money you are giving us. But in all this, please be careful that something does not happen in Balochistan that we will not be able to handle later.  And if here you are thinking that the geopolitical analysts of the entire world, the media of the entire world are writing openly.  Again, these days people listen a lot to Germany, so if you look at the German media DW News, they are also openly saying how the Iran-Israel conflict will be destabilized by Pakistan.  The question is whether any opportunities will open up for India at such a time. See, in this particular case, if we do something, the US will literally come to the rescue of Pakistan because at this time a deep military alliance, I would say an unofficial military alliance, has been formed between the US and Pakistan against Iran, so in that case, I don't think India is going to do anything, but again I have to say here that we will have to remain very alert on our borders for the next 10 years, because as soon as Iran falls and after that, a destabilizing effect starts on their border with Iran, then large scale militants will arise. Terrorism may increase in Pakistan, which may have a negative impact on the entire region. So again a lot of developments are yet to happen. You will see that Balochistan is going to be constantly in the news in the coming few weeks.  I am just waiting for Trump to make his decision.  This Trump is lost in these thoughts right now. When Trump finally says, okay, let's do this.  The history is fine.  Will he remember me like this? These were the options before me. I had to do this.  So many more developments will come in future.  Some updates come in the future I will keep bringing updated videos for you.
