00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,440
Prashant Dhawan. Now, ever since the meeting between Asim Munir and

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,679
Donald Trump,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,080
a lot of details have come to light. Firstly,

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,039
I have noted one thing that

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
today the people of Afghanistan are criticizing the government of Pakistan and

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,279
its military.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,279
Till date, I have probably

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,080
not seen such criticism even from Indians.

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,039

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,600
In this photo, you can see a collage of images posted by many Afghans on social media

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,880
that how over the years,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,840
whichever army general of Pakistan has been there, be it Rahil Sharif

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,079
Bajwa or Musharraf, all of them were

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,239
indirectly working for the US

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,160
and you will find many of their assets

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,640
in Western countries, primarily

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,879
in the US and the UK and therefore many Afghans have

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
written that the greatest

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,320
betrayer of Islam is the government of

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,879
Pakistan and recently Asim Munir has met

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,480
Donald Trump here, it is

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,040
confirmed that the USA wants

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,520
Pakistan's airspace, its military

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,240
bases, whatever the US wants to do in Iran in the coming weeks, the US

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,240

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560
wants Pakistan's full cooperation in that and if you are

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,040
asking me this here, but what does the US

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,360
want to do, see, the US media itself is reporting that

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,439
Donald Trump is

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,040
also looking at tactical nuclear weapons,

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,200
a video of this went

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,920
viral recently, according to me, this is the

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,159
biggest development so far that Iran's

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,079
nuclear program will be completely

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
ended.  For this, the

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,720
US can use a tactical nuclear weapon

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,759
to destroy whatever progress Iran has made in

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,159
uranium enrichment through center fuses.  Please

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,159

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,400
watch this small clip.  You will be able to see this

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,400
in this video.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Bunkeringical

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,560
but White House thing

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,799
on the table even tactical news

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,360
now here you have to understand that they are saying

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,000
that Iran's nuclear program and

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,920
according to the US, the supreme leader of Iran is

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
underground, so to hit there,

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,200
they can use bunker buster bombs, about

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,360
which there is no 100% certainty whether

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,720
this will work or not and

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
hence the talks are going on about tactical nuclear

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,360
weapons because Donald Trump has made one thing

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
clear.  They do not want American

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,239
soldiers to go to Iran themselves.

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,319
Destroy everything yourself.  They don't want

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,200
American boots on the ground, so here's

59
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,959
a solution called this tactical nuclear

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,720
weapon, a small nuclear weapon.

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,640
Now watch again as I deliver this news.

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,959
When I tell you the perspective of

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,599
some Pakistanis in the American media,

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,319
they get angry and attack me.

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,640
Look, I am not doing all this.

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,160
If this thing is entering your mind a little.

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,080
I am just telling you what is happening.

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
I am not Trump.  I don't

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,640
take decisions.  I am just telling you all

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,280
what is happening here.  Now it is obvious that

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,519
Pakistan does not want to get involved in all this at all.

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,080
All this is

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,800
a very bad situation for Pakistan that the US will

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,120
attack.  Here Iran will have to

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,959
support Pakistan.  The way USA

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
attacked Afghanistan.

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,120
Pakistan had to be supported.  Now

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,760
look, Asim Munir has clearly told Donald Trump one

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,920
thing that

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,560
militancy will increase a lot in Balochistan.  That

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,519
Balochistan could slip out of Pakistan's hands

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,440
if the Israel-Iran conflict

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,680
continues in this manner.  Because you have to

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,480
understand that if we look at the world map, when we

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,360
say Balochistan, Balochistan is

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,480
not only in Pakistan.  Balochistan was once a

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,080
whole region, which is

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,239
now divided.  A little bit of

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
Balochistan is also in Afghanistan.

90
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,400
Much of Balochistan is in Iran and

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,959
Balochistan is also in Pakistan.  If I

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,519
say that Baloch people should get their own country, then

93
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,599
Pakistan's land will be lost in it.  A

94
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,840
little bit of southern area of ​​Afghanistan

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,480
and a lot of area of ​​Iran will go away and then

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,480
a Balochistan will be formed.  And the

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,200
freedom fighters of Balochistan

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,080
who want a country named Balochistan to be

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,319
formed again, Republic of Balochistan, they are

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,319
often talking about this type of country.

101
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,639
Now Asif Munir has

102
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,320
clearly told Donald Trump that if

103
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,560
Iran's military is destroyed.

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,160
These people bring about a coup in Iran.

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Everything changes

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,080
in Iran.  In that case, there are many groups of

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,600
Baloch militants who are today

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,400
in Balochistan of Iran,

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Balochistan of Pakistan.  They

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,880
can capture Balochistan in Iran and after that they

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,040

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,440
can influence the Balochistan in Pakistan as well.  And

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,840
after that, the government of Pakistan, the

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,919
military of Pakistan would not be able to handle that situation

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,080
because there would be cross border militancy happening there.  The

116
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,639
Balochistan Liberation Army which is

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,160
in Pakistan must be

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,320
getting huge support from Iran.  Of Baloch

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
militants and as far as I have been

120
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,479
able to see articles of US experts,

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,960
vlogs, the USA has

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,280
no interest, no concern in whether

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,080
Pakistan is able to hold on to Balochistan

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,960
or not.  They don't care.  At this

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,960
moment Donald Trump is seeing one thing.

126
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
His legacy What did I say?  His

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,280
legacy.  Tell Trump that this is most

128
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
likely his last term.  After this, the

129
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,360
process of becoming President again is very

130
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
complicated.  He says that he will try.

131
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
But again, I don't think

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,280
he will be able to become President for the third time after this

133
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,360
because the US Constitution does

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,199
not allow it and it doesn't seem in the Constitution

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,440
that changes can be made after the mid-term

136
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,240
elections.  So Trump knows that the way

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,039
future generations will judge Trump,

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
this

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,759
part of Trump's foreign policy regarding Iran will

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,880
matter a lot.  Will Trump

141
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,000
be the President who will use

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,000
nuclear weapon on foreign soil for the first time in several decades after Harry Truman

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,720
and let me tell you this,

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,280
as soon as Trump drops a tactical

145
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
nuclear warhead

146
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,240
on Iran or I say topples Iran,

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,199
overthrows the government here,

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,759
after that we do not know which new Iran will

149
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,319
emerge.  These experiments of USA have gone

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,880
very wrong in Libya.

151
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,840
You might remember that once upon a time ISIS had emerged in Iraq.

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,319
So

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,039
after whatever the US is going to do in Iran, which new

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,680
Iran will emerge? We do not know anything can

155
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,120
happen.  And that is why Donald Trump is taking maximum time.

156
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,199
He said I

157
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,360
need two more weeks.  I am evaluating.   I am

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,080
seeing what can happen.

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,479
This is what Trump hopes here, too.  There should be a ceasefire.   The

160
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,199
next President after me should handle this problem.  All

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,680
these difficulties and hardships are being

162
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,000
fought.  But Asim Muran has

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
clearly said that we will help you.

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,639
We will take the money you are giving us.

165
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,520
But in all this, please be careful that

166
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,520
something does not happen in Balochistan that we will

167
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,919
not be able to handle later.  And if here you are

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,240
thinking that the

169
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,800
geopolitical analysts of the entire world, the media of the entire world are

170
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,120
writing openly.  Again, these days people

171
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,440
listen a lot to Germany, so if

172
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,160
you look at the German media DW News, they are

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,400
also openly saying

174
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,400
how the Iran-Israel conflict will be

175
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,639
destabilized by Pakistan.  The

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,360
question is whether

177
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,560
any opportunities will open up for India at such a time.

178
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,120
See, in this particular case,

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,039
if we do something, the US will literally

180
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,120
come to the rescue of Pakistan because at this

181
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,919
time a deep military alliance, I would

182
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,479
say an unofficial military alliance, has been

183
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,360
formed between the US and

184
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,520
Pakistan against Iran, so in that case, I don't

185
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
think India is going to do anything, but again

186
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,440
I have to say here that we will have to

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,160
remain very alert on our borders for the

188
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,720
next 10 years, because as soon as

189
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,039
Iran falls and after that,

190
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,199
a destabilizing effect starts on their border with Iran,

191
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,960
then large scale

192
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
militants will arise.

193
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Terrorism may increase in Pakistan, which

194
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,280
may have a negative impact on the entire region.

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
So again a lot of developments are yet to happen.

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,599
You will see that Balochistan is

197
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,759
going to be constantly in the news in the coming few

198
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,000
weeks.  I am just waiting for

199
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,000
Trump to make his decision.  This

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,080
Trump is lost in these thoughts right now.

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
When Trump finally says, okay,

202
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,720
let's do this.  The history is fine.  Will he remember me like this?

203
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,039
These were the options before me.

204
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,879
I had to do this.  So many more

205
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,960
developments will come in future.  Some updates come in the

206
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,759
future I will keep bringing updated videos for you.

207
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,919
Look, I believe that if

208
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,000
you are

209
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,240
not using Artificial Intelligence in your work today, then you are

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,200
living in a different era because with the

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,519
help of AI, you can do many jobs.

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,519
You can make a lot of money.  You

213
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,599
can upskill yourself.  For example, if

214
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,320
I want to show that Captain

215
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,480
America is

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
eating Vada Pav in a busy street of Mumbai and above it is

217
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
written a very attractive text '

218
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,920
Yummy', then I can easily do this by

219
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,480
entering the right prompt.  And here you can see it was

220
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,040
just that easy.

221
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,160
You can make many variants of this.  If I want to

222
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,080
move this image, I can do it in the

223
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,800
way you can see on your screen.

224
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,440
I can make

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,920

226
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,399

227
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,440
I can pretty much do anything.  And this is just

228
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,880
one small, I mean one very small,

229
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,120
