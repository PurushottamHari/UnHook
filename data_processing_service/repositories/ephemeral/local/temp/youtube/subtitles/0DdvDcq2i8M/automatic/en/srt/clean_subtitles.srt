Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, recently a news related to Indian economy came that India's net FDI, please understand it carefully.  We are talking about net FDI. It has crashed more than 96% of the time. And you will get to see this for the first time. Meaning, since the time this calculation started. You can see this news.  Net FDI inflows sink 96% to record low.  So what does this mean?  What I mean to say is, what is this net FDI?  Why did it ultimately fall so much?  Is there any problem in the economy? What is the overall situation of FDI?  I will tell you all this in detail in the video.  Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that from today our foundation batch of Pratigya for 2026 UPSC is starting.  The most special thing about this batch is that if you take it, avail it and crack the prelims as well, your entire fee will be refunded. Apart from this there are many features.   The link is given in the comment section.  All you have to do is use this code AnkitLive so that you can avail maximum discount.  Let's get started.  Look, the first question that comes to mind is what is FDI and why does this net FDI matter?   It is a simple thing, you all know it.  FDI means Foreign Direct Investment. Meaning when money comes from abroad.  Now money can come from abroad in many ways.   Any individual can invest. Any company can invest.  A fund can invest money within India.  Now this money can be invested in the Indian economy in many ways.  For example, in India, there are businesses, factories, real estate, they have invested there or in the shares of companies, whether listed or unlisted.  But keep in mind that FDI is basically the money that comes for the long term. Meaning the money which is invested in India for a long time by foreign countries.  And it is not like that suppose today you invested money in the stock market.  There is a person sitting abroad, he invested money today through FBI and after 10 days he got profit.  He took his money and went away. That will not come under FDI. Here we basically talk about long term. When money is invested in real businesses , we talk about Foreign Direct Investment.  Now I understand this Foreign Direct Investment. But what is this net FDI?  Look, it is a simple thing which is gross inflow, that is, whatever amount of FDI there is.  Suppose if I say $000 was invested in India in a year.  Ok?  As an example. But some of the money that was invested here earlier got outflowed. So suppose if I say $600 went out of India, then what is the net FDI here?  It came to $400.  So what is the gross?  It's $1000.  Whatever money is invested in India is in the form of FDI. But this outflow that we are talking about, there are three things included in it which you should know.  It will become very important especially from your exam perspective. What do we subtract from the gross FDI to get our net FDI?  So here are three things you have to keep in mind.  The first is foreign investors repatriating profits.  That means, suppose in the last few years, any foreign investor would have invested his money in India, then he would have got some profit from it.  For example, in India, if there is a Reliance company, then there are foreign investors too, they invest in Reliance.  So whatever profit Reliance makes here, they will also take that profit and take it outside India.  So whatever profit goes outside India, we remove it from these FDIs. Apart from this, if the entire investment which is already there is withdrawn, suppose someone had invested $5000 in an Indian company and now he is deciding to withdraw the entire money, then when he takes the entire investment out of India, that also comes under outflow and at the same time keep in mind that the Indian companies which invest abroad, just like foreign companies are investing in India and we call it FDI, similarly there will be some big companies of India too like Tata, Reliance, Adani, they also invest abroad.  So we subtract whatever they invest also. So these three things basically come under outflow.  So when we subtract the outflow from the gross inflows, we get net FDI.  So I hope this thing has become crystal clear to you.  Now the question is what has happened here in 2024-25 ?  What is this shock?  The shock is that our net FDI has crashed by 96.5%.  How is this?  For example, if you compare 2023-24, our net FDI in 2023-24 was $.6 billion.  Ok?  Well, that 's a good thing.  $.6 billion.  But in the very next year, i.e. last year, if you look at it in 2024-25, we call it FY 25, i.e. 2024-25.  So what was our net FDI here?  Just $353 million.   I mean, just think about it, it was worth more than $ billion last year and this house has come down to $ 353 million.  So, how much has the downfall been? Of 96.5%.  And since we are calculating FDI here, you must be aware that the LPG reforms came and the economy was liberalized in 1991, if you see from then till now, the biggest crash has come of 96.5%, so due to this there was a lot of discussion about it. Now the question here is why did this collapse happen?  What is the reason?  Look, here it is not necessary to look at it in one way that there has been a 96% crash.  It means there is a big problem.  It's not like that.  Understand this carefully here.  The first thing that has happened is that there has been massive repatriation by foreign investors; foreign investors have withdrawn a lot of the money that they had earlier invested in India.  Let me tell you how much I withdrew. In 2023-24 they withdrew Rs 41 billion. But last year in FY 25, 2024-25, they withdrew Rs 49 billion. And the foreign investors here have also booked their profits which they had invested.  Was.  For example, you might remember SWGI's IPO came last year.  Hund Hyundai India's IPO had come.  What is all this?  These were very big IPOs.  So what happened here was that foreign investors had invested a lot of money in these companies.  So it is obvious that when the IPO came, whatever profit they made here, when the shares were listed in the stock market, they sold a lot of their shares and so what did they do with all this money?  Took it back. So here basically because of the buyback that has happened, the IPO that has come, a lot of money went out of India last year.  So this is a big reason why our net FDI has collapsed so much. Along with this, Indian firms have also invested a lot abroad.  The Indian companies are also expanding themselves globally. You can see that last year $29 billion was invested abroad by Indian companies. And somewhere we do gross inflows minus outflows.  So if you look at this gross inflow, it has actually increased by 14%. You can see that last year 81 billion was gone.  Which was around Rs 70 billion last year.  So now it has become 81 billion.  And why is that so? Because the foreign investors have invested here in India's renewable energy, financial services, tech startups and manufacturing.  But because these outflows and repatriation had become very high here, you saw a crash in FDI net FDI. Maybe our net FDI could have gone into negative also but it has still remained slightly in positive. Well this is not entirely negative.  What I was telling you is that the crash of net FDI does not mean that it will be a big shock to our Indian economy.   In fact, this shows that the Indian investment story has matured a lot. Those old foreign investors now feel that they should earn profits.  It is not like that he will keep his money in India throughout his life.  They will also take the profit.  So Indian firms are also becoming global investors themselves.  So this shows the maturing investment cycle.  This shows confidence in the Indian economy.  Actually, if you see, the foreign investors are also taking back their money by issuing IPOs. Look, this is not a capital flight. What is the problem when there is panic among foreign investors?  He feels that India's economic story is heading downwards.  It is going down.  There is a big problem in the Indian economy.  So what happens suddenly?  A panic situation arises due to which foreign investors start withdrawing their money and exiting. So repatriation does not mean panic selling.  You have to understand this and at the same time, as I was telling you, the Indian firms are also growing internationally. So this becomes a big thing in itself. But yes, it is not like everything is fine.  We also have to take care of these things. Here we have to see that there is not too much outflow.  The money that is flowing out should be in a limited quantity.  It may go out suddenly.  Like what happened last year, as I told you, 96% crash happened because its impact comes in the value of our rupee.  The current account comes into deficit.  This affects the forex reserves because when a lot of money is suddenly withdrawn, it will have a rapid impact on all these.  Apart from this, another problem is that FDI in our country is highly concentrated in some sectors. Finance is highly concentrated in many sectors within finance.  The government should try to balance this.  There is more FDI in other sectors as well and the long term impact means that if suddenly a lot of money outflows, then job creation, technology, transfer, infrastructure funding etc. are also affected and that is why if you see, the RBI data here also shows that the gap between gross inflow and net impact has increased significantly.  So India must now continue policy reforms so that more and more foreign capital comes and make India more attractive for investments.  And apart from this, what reinvestment means here is that there is a foreign investor who has invested his money. Now he is making profit. Earn profit but invest that money back in the Indian economy.  This effort should be made and we should provide more incentives for long term FDI. So look, the conclusion is that India 's net FDI crash will seem good for the headline.  You can see in our headline what happened.  But this is not a crisis.  This is the profit taking cycle by foreign investors.  Indian companies are becoming global players and structural maturity is coming in India's capital markets.  This is it.  But I hope that all your doubts would have been cleared through this video.  You must have understood everything crystal clear.  And before leaving, a very interesting question, can you tell me which of these are the sectors where gross FDI inflow was seen in 2024-25? Despite net FDI fall.
