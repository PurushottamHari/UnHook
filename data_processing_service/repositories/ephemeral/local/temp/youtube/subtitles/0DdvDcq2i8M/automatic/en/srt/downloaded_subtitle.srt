00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,080
Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, recently

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,400
a news related to Indian economy came

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,800
that India's net FDI, please

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,080
understand it carefully.  We are talking about net FDI.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,400
It has crashed more than 96% of the time.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,240
And you will get to see this for the first time.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,240
Meaning, since the time this calculation started.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,240
You can see this news.  Net FDI

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,079
inflows sink 96% to record low.  So

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,719
what does this mean?  What I mean to say is,

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,480
what is this net FDI?  Why did it ultimately

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
fall so much?  Is there any

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
problem in the economy?

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
What is the overall situation of FDI?  I will tell you all this in

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
detail in the video.  Let's

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,239
move on.  But before that, friends, let me

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,360
tell you all that from today our foundation batch of

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,120

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
Apart from this there are many features.   The

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,199
link is given in the comment section.  All

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,199
you have to do is use this code AnkitLive so that

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,799
you can avail maximum discount.  Let's get

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,200
started.  Look, the first

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,920
question that comes to mind is what is FDI

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,320
and why does this net FDI matter?   It is a

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,560
simple thing, you all know it.  FDI

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,040
means Foreign Direct Investment.

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
Meaning when money comes from abroad.  Now

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
money can come from abroad in many ways.   Any

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,280
individual can invest.

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,520
Any company can invest.  A fund

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,759
can invest money within India.  Now this

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,520
money can be invested in the Indian economy in many ways.  For

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,320
example, in India, there are

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,400
businesses, factories, real estate,

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,960
they have invested there or in the

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,880
shares of companies, whether

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,200
listed or unlisted.  But keep in

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,680
mind that FDI is basically the

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,040
money that comes for the long term.

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,360
Meaning the money which is invested in India for a long time

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,439

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,680
by foreign countries.  And it is not like that suppose today

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,920
you invested money in the stock market.  There is a

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
person sitting abroad, he

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,719
invested money today through FBI and after 10 days

52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,560
he got profit.  He took his money and went away.

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,880
That will not come under FDI.

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,720
Here we basically talk about long term.

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
When money is invested in real businesses

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,120
, we talk about

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
Foreign Direct Investment.  Now I understand this Foreign

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,879
Direct Investment.

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,000
But what is this net FDI?  Look, it is a simple

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,160
thing which is gross inflow, that is,

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,599
whatever amount of FDI there is.  Suppose if I

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,840
say $000 was invested in India

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,239
in a year.  Ok?  As an example.

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,200
But some of the money that was invested here earlier got

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,440
outflowed.

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,400
So suppose if I say $600

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,959
went out of India, then what is the net FDI

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,120
here?  It came to $400.  So

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,519
what is the gross?  It's $1000.  Whatever money is

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,000
invested in India is in the form of FDI.

71
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
But this outflow that we are talking about, there are

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
three things included in it which

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
you should know.  It will become

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,160
very important especially from your exam perspective.

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
What do we subtract from the gross FDI to get

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,720
our net

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,040
FDI?  So here are three things you have to keep in

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,599
mind.  The first is foreign

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,920
investors repatriating profits.  That means,

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,319
suppose in the last few years, any

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,319
foreign investor would have invested his money

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,560
in India, then he would have

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,840
got some profit from it.  For example, in India,

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,599
if there is a Reliance company, then there are foreign investors

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,519
too, they invest in

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,120
Reliance.  So whatever profit Reliance makes here,

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
they will also

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,159
take that profit and take it outside India.  So

89
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,640
whatever profit goes outside India,

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,720
we remove it from these FDIs.

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Apart from this, if the

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,519
entire investment which is already there is withdrawn,

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,440
suppose someone had invested $5000 in an Indian

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,760
company and now he is

95
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,000
deciding to withdraw the entire money,

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,080
then when he takes the entire investment

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
out of India, that also comes

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,280
under outflow and at the same time keep in mind that the

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Indian companies which

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
invest abroad, just like foreign companies are

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,680
investing in India and we

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
call it FDI, similarly there will

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,560
be some big companies of India too like Tata, Reliance,

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,200
Adani,

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,040
they also invest abroad.  So

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,959
we subtract whatever they invest also.

107
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,599
So these three things

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,439
basically come under outflow.  So

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,840
when we subtract the outflow from the gross inflows,

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,400
we

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,239
get net FDI.  So I hope this thing has become

112
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,600
crystal clear to you.  Now the

113
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,000
question is what has happened here in 2024-25

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,240
?  What is this shock?  The shock is

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,639
that our net FDI has

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,000
crashed by 96.5%.  How is this?  For example,

117
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,560
if you compare

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,639
2023-24, our net FDI in 2023-24 was

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,680
$.6 billion.  Ok?  Well, that

120
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,520
's a good thing.  $.6 billion.  But in the very

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,440
next year, i.e. last year, if you

122
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,000
look at it in 2024-25, we call it FY 25, i.e.

123
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,080
2024-25.  So

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,639
what was our net FDI here?  Just $353 million.   I

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,080
mean, just think about it, it was worth more than $ billion last year

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,759
and this house has come down to $

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,840
353 million.  So, how much has the downfall been?

128
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,280
Of 96.5%.  And since we are calculating

129
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,520
FDI here, you must be aware that the

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,000
LPG reforms came and the economy was

131
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,560
liberalized in 1991, if

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,039
you see from then till now, the biggest crash has

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,960
come of

134
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,800
96.5%, so due to this there was a lot of discussion about it.

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,560
Now the question here is

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
why did this collapse happen?  What

137
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,080
is the reason?  Look, here it is not necessary to

138
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,000
look at it in one way that there has been a 96% crash.  It

139
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,360
means there is a big

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,919
problem.  It's not like that.  Understand this carefully here.  The

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,199
first thing that has happened is that there has been

142
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,600
massive repatriation by foreign investors;

143
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
foreign investors have withdrawn a lot of the money that they had earlier invested in India.  Let me

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,080

145
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,120

146
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,240
tell you how much I withdrew.

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,600
In 2023-24 they withdrew Rs 41 billion.

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,560
But last year in FY 25, 2024-25,

149
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,320
they withdrew Rs 49 billion.

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,319
And the foreign investors here have

151
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,680
also booked their profits which

152
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,080
they had invested.  Was.  For

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,639
example, you might remember SWGI's

154
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,560
IPO came last year.  Hund Hyundai India's

155
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,199
IPO had come.  What is all this?  These

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
were very big IPOs.  So what happened here was that

157
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,960
foreign investors had invested a lot of money in

158
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,440
these companies.  So it is

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,800
obvious that when the IPO came,

160
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,800
whatever profit they made here, when the shares were

161
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,880
listed in the stock market,

162
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
they sold a lot of their shares

163
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,319
and so

164
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,720
what did they do with all this money?  Took it back.

165
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,280
So here basically because of the buyback that has happened, the

166
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,639
IPO that has come, a lot of

167
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,720
money went out of India last year.  So

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,960
this is a big reason why

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,440
our net FDI has collapsed so much.

170
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,759
Along with this, Indian firms have

171
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,080
also invested a lot

172
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
abroad.  The Indian companies are also

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,440
expanding themselves globally.

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,759
You can see that last year $29 billion was

175
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,000
invested abroad by Indian companies.

176
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,759
And

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,160
somewhere we do gross inflows minus

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,360
outflows.  So if you look at this gross inflow,

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,840
it has actually increased by 14%.

180
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,400
You can see that last year 81

181
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,639
billion was gone.  Which was

182
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,280
around Rs 70 billion last year.  So

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,280
now it has become 81 billion.  And why is that so?

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,039
Because the foreign investors have

185
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,800

186
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,400

187
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400

188
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,960
invested here in India's renewable energy, financial services, tech startups and manufacturing.  But because

189
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,120
these outflows and repatriation had become

190
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,759
very high here,

191
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,599
you saw a crash in FDI net FDI.

192
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,599
Maybe

193
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,599
our net FDI could have gone into negative also but

194
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,919
it has still remained slightly in positive.

195
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,919
Well this is not entirely negative.  What

196
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
I was telling you is that the crash of net FDI does

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,080

198
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,000
not mean that it will be a big shock to our Indian economy.   In

199
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,560
fact, this shows that the Indian

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,039
investment story has matured a lot.

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,800
Those old foreign investors now

202
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,639
feel that they should earn profits.  It is

203
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,319
not like that he will

204
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
keep his money in India throughout his life.  They will also

205
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
take the profit.  So Indian firms are

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,599
also becoming global investors

207
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,520
themselves.  So this

208
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,759
shows the maturing investment cycle.  This shows

209
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,160
confidence in the Indian economy.  Actually,

210
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,720
if you see, the foreign investors are

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,879
also taking back their money by issuing IPOs.

212
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Look, this is not a capital flight.

213
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,520
What is the problem when there is

214
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,800
panic among foreign investors?  He feels that

215
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,440
India's economic story is heading downwards.  It

216
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,200
is going down.  There is a

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
big problem in the Indian economy.  So

218
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
what happens suddenly?  A panic situation arises

219
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,640
due to which foreign investors

220
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,640
start withdrawing their money and exiting.

221
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
So repatriation does not mean panic

222
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,399
selling.  You have to understand this and at the

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,399
same time, as I was telling you, the

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
Indian firms are also growing internationally.

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,160
So this becomes a big thing in itself.

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,320
But yes, it is not like

227
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,399
everything is fine.  We also have to take care of these things.

228
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
Here we have to see that

229
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,640
there is not too much outflow.  The

230
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,399
money that is flowing out should be in a limited

231
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,480
quantity.  It may go

232
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,120
out suddenly.  Like what happened last year, as

233
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,800
I told you, 96% crash happened because

234
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,800
its impact

235
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,720
comes in the value of our rupee.  The current account

236
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,399
comes into deficit.  This affects the forex reserves

237
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
because when a lot of money is suddenly

238
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,240
withdrawn, it will have a rapid impact on all these.  Apart from this, another

239
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,760

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
problem is that FDI in our country is

241
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,800
highly concentrated in some sectors.

242
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,399
Finance is

243
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,399
highly concentrated in many sectors within finance.  The

244
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480

245
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,320
government should try to balance this.  There is

246
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,399
more FDI in other sectors as well and the

247
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
long term impact means that if suddenly

248
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,080
a lot of money outflows, then

249
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
job creation, technology, transfer,

250
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,839
infrastructure funding etc. are also

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
affected and that is why if you see, the

252
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,680
RBI data here also

253
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,000
shows that the gap between

254
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,560
gross inflow and net impact has increased significantly.  So

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,640
India must now continue policy reforms

256
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,560
so that more and more foreign capital comes and

257
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
make India more attractive for

258
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
investments.  And apart from this,

259
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,560
what reinvestment means here is that there is a

260
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,000
foreign investor who has invested his money.

261
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
Now he is making profit.

262
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,080
Earn profit but invest that money back

263
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
in the Indian economy.  This effort should be made

264
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,000
and we should provide more incentives for long term FDI.

265
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,920

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,040
So look, the conclusion is that India

267
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,200
's net FDI crash will

268
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,440
seem good for the headline.  You can see in our headline

269
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,519
what happened.  But this is

270
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279
not a crisis.  This is the profit taking cycle

271
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,040
by foreign investors.  Indian

272
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,800
companies are becoming global players and

273
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,640
structural maturity is coming in India's

274
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,640
capital markets.  This is it.  But I

275
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,079
hope that all your doubts would have been cleared through this video.  You must have

276
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839

277
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,200
understood everything crystal clear.  And

278
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
before leaving, a very interesting

279
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
question, can you tell me which of these are the

280
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,959
sectors where gross FDI

281
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,160
inflow was seen in 2024-25?

282
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,720
Despite net FDI fall.  So in which of the

283
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,480
following did you see the gross FDI in

284
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,160
significant amount

285
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,839
