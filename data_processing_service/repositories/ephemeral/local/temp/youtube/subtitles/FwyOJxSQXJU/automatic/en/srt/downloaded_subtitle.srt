00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello Friends.  Friends, a

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,920
report has come out from America which has created a

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,919
stir in entire Israel.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,320
As you all know,

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,639
Iran is also not behind during the Middle East war.  Iran has

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,280
also launched a barrage of missiles

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,279
on Israel.  Due to which Israel's entire air

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,119
defense system has become overloaded.

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,920
And because of this it is being said that

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,320
Israel has a strategic missile of hardly 10 to 12 days.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,400
Like you might have

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
heard about Arrow Defense System.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,039
So very little stock is left.  You can see

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,840
this news is Israel running out of missile

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,160
interceptors, bomb shell report claims

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
defense system is near breaking point as

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,320
war with Iran escalates.  So, let

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
us understand this in a little detail as to

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,680
what exactly was said in the report and

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,239
what could be its implications?  Because if

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,719
this is true then many of the

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,200
civilian areas here will become weak

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,120
in the air defence system.  And

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,480
Israel could suffer huge losses.  Let's

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
move on.  But before that, friends, let me

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,320
tell you all that those of you who are

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,559
preparing for UPSC

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
for 2026 or 2027,

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,720
must avail our Pratigya Foundation Batch.  If anyone has

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,479
any kind of doubt in this, our

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,400
team is sitting here, you can call on this phone number

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,159
and all your doubts will be

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
resolved.  Let's get started.

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
First of all, if we tell you, the

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
war currently going on between Iran and Israel has

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,960
reached full scale.  It is a

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
war.  Meaning, there should be no doubt

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,280
that yes, things can increase further or

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,200
decrease.  It's a war right now.  So a

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,479
full scale missile conflict is

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,119
going on at present.  Due to which Iran also acquired

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,560
100s of ballistic and hypersonic

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,320
missiles.  Yes, it happened just yesterday.

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,119
I had also made a video in which their

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,439
hypersonic missile Fateh One was

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,360
launched here.  And because of this, if

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,000
you see, there are many targets

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,640
in Israel, whether it is Haifa, Tel

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,040
Aviv, the Northern Coast coastal regions,

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,680
here also many intelligence

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
centers of Israel were targeted, attempts were made to target all of them.  In

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
view of this,

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,159
Israel put its multi-tier missile

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,560
defence system on overdrive.

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,719
Meaning, it has been launched on a full scale

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
so that maximum number of missiles coming

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,880
from Iran can be intercepted and

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,280
destroyed as quickly as

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,760
possible so that Israel remains safe here.

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
So this is what Israel is trying to do at the moment.  Well,

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,520
before learning a little about this,

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,000
you should know a little about Israel's missile defense ecosystem

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,319
because here you will get to see a five-layered defense

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,480
network.  First up

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,640
is the Iron Dome.  You all must be knowing about Iron Dome.

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,120
This is for short range rockets.

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,200
Like 70 Km.  If we have to

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,840
intercept and kill any rocket within the range of , then

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,840
Israel uses this for that.

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Irono and most of this if you look at it, it's

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,040
Hamas.  Apart from this,

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,959
it was used against those who became Hezbollah in Lebanon.

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
Then secondly, if we

75
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,760
talk about medium range missiles, 40 to

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,080
300 km.  The one that intercepts and kills within the range of

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,000
is David Sling.  And again

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
these are all used by Israel only.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,160
Then the third, and this

80
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,560
becomes very important, arrow two and arrow

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
three.  Arrow Two and Arrow Three are basically

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
for long range ballistic missiles.  1500

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,920
Km  Up to that, the interception arrow

84
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,879
can do it.  And if you look at Arrow Three, it

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,519

86
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,000
can also intercept exoatmospheric hypersonic missiles.  2000 Km

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,159
More than the range.  Well, when it comes to exo

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,319
atmospheric hypersonic, it means a

89
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,000
simple thing.  Let's say it's Iran.  Iran

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,080
launched a missile here.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,720
Launched a ballistic missile.  So what will happen here?

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,440
Israel shoots it down in mid-course,

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,920
when this ballistic missile goes out of the atmosphere.  It

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,080
goes into space and

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,720
detects Israel in the space itself and

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,440
kills it, so we call it exo-

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,280
atmospheric hypersonic.  So all these

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,000
become very important for Israel.

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,799
And the fifth layer here is

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
deployed by the USA, you must have

101
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,959
heard about the third system,

102
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,720
Patriot and the third one, this is

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,200
used for high altitude threads.  So USA is

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,360
also helping Israel in a way here.

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,439
Well now the question here is

106
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,239
what is its financial implication

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,480
?  Look, whenever a missile is fired by Iran

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,799
on Israel and when

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,360
Israel intercepts it and kills and

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,080
destroys it, the cost of each one is

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,640
2 to $3 million dollars.  Think about it.  The

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
meaning depends on which of

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,639
your defense systems is used.  According

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,199
to that, the cost of killing one missile is $2 to $3 million.

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,759

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,840
So according to the current rate of doses, if you

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,800
look at it in terms of usage, here

118
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,199
Israel is consuming 285 doses every night, that is, in one day.

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,000
$25 sorry million dollars

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:39,040
means $3 billion per day and with this

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,960
launch rate, Iran is

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
trying to target with precision

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,680
using hypersonic weapons over Israel.

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,639
Due to this, Israel has put its multiple

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,199
interceptors on the line. What I mean to say is

126
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,680
that Israel is currently trying to

127
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,600

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,520
destroy more than 90% of its missiles and there are some

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
missiles that fall on empty areas, so

130
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,280
Israel leaves them

131
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
because why waste money by intercepting them. So

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,600
you will

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
get to see the situation this time. Now the question is

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,520
how long will this continue because

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,600
you can already see that almost a week is going to pass

136
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,680
and the war is going on continuously here. In

137
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
view of this, in the

138
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,320
report that has come out from the US Defense sources, it has been

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,960
said that Israel has

140
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,800

141
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,120

142
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,960

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120

144
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,280
already used more than 400 of the Arrow type interceptors, I showed you this Arrow type, Arrow two and Arrow three, out of these interceptor missiles.  This means that it has

145
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,960
already used a large part of its strategic stock pile and

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,039
if things continue like this, then

148
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,360
within 10 to 12 days its Arrow

149
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,080
missile reserve will be exhausted

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,120
and depleted. Once it is depleted, the

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,080
threat to Israel will increase significantly, which

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,320
means it is obvious that it will have to prioritize those particular

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,800
targets, which

154
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,960
means that Israel will now have to choose

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,080
which missile to kill and which one to

156
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,560
leave.  So it is possible that

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,319
Israel will

158
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
try to protect its strategic assets here and will shoot down

159
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,639
all those missiles.  But there will

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,880
be many such missiles of Iran which

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,520
can fall in civilian areas of Israel,

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,000
which again can cause a lot of damage to

163
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,919
Israel.  So because of this, it is being

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,319
considered a big threat for Israel.

165
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, what strategic vulnerabilities are

166
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
emerging here?  Because if you

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,199
see, Iran has already carried out many

168
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,720
successful hits on Israel.  It's

169
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
not like that.  Look, Israel is already doing this

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
against Iran, but it is not that Iran is lagging

171
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
behind.  If you see, Iran has already

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,199

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,280
caused damage to the oil facility in Haifa, Israel.

174
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
Apart from this, the Northern Intelligence Base was

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,080
also attacked here in a way.

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
The public is getting panicky.  I am getting fatigued in

177
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
a way.

178
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
People are also disturbed here because of the continuous sounding of sirens etc.

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,639
And why is all this happening?  It is

180
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,800
because Iran is playing very strategically here.  It is

181
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,319
not like you can

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,479
slowly launch one or two missiles every half hour throughout the day.

184
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
This is not the case,

185
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,199
what Iran is doing is launching

186
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
100 to 150 missiles here at one time within half an hour.

187
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,919
So what will happen is that

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,240
when you launch 100 to 150 missiles simultaneously, it is possible

189
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
that 100 missiles will be intercepted here

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,120
, destroyed, and the remaining 25

191
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,360
to 50 missiles will

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
fall in the cities of Israel.  Because of which the loss will be

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
greater.  Then apart from this,

194
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,560
I told you about hypersonic,

195
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,120

196
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,199
Iran has also used hypersonic now, which means the speed is tremendous

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,360
and apart from this, the entire defense

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,840
system here, the radar system, is currently under

199
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,520
a lot of stress of Israel.  Well

200
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,199
now the question here is

201
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
what is America doing?  Will Trump get involved

202
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,479
?  Will Trump help here?   It

203
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
is obvious that help is coming from behind.

204
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,240
Considering this, there is a lot of

205
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,240
stress on Israel's defense

206
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,280
system.  What has the USA done?  Our

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,919
third batteries and destroyers were

208
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,240
deployed in the Mediterranean so that the

209
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,319
US can also use its missiles to

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,000
protect Israel.  Apart from this, it is

211
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,960
also being said here

212
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,440
that the already stopped pile lying at the European and NATO bases is being

213
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,919

214
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,840
sent from there to Israel.  But now the

215
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,160
problem is that it will

216
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,160
take two to three weeks to arrive.  The arrow type

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
system will take two to three weeks to arrive.

218
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,240
And how much stock pile is

219
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,080
left here?  Hardly 12 days.  So you

220
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,919
can understand how vulnerable Israel has become at this time.

221
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,759
And

222
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,840
I have already told you about Iran's strategy that

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,960
how Iran is combining everything at

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,520
this time and means that

225
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,759
Iran is forcing maximum power on

226
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,560
Israel at this time and because of this,

227
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,719
if you see, their main aim at this time has become to

228
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,959

229
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,200
drain Israel's defense and in a

230
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,039
way expose its vulnerability.  Because

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
look, Israel was also doing similar things.

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,519
Israel also

233
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
destroyed Iran's overall defense system here

234
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,920
so that its fighter jets could go inside Iran

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,000
and come back after bombing. And

236
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,560

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,360
if you see the hypersonic missile that Iran has used here, Fateh One,

238
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,839
it alerts the traditional radar

239
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,880
and hits it.  Apart from this, its

240
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,720
speed is Mach 13 to 15.  Hughes and

241
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,640
besides this, the treasury here

242
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,880
can be changed in mid-flight and

243
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,360
because of this Israel can get confused as to

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,680
where the missile is going to fall,

245
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,760
hence the hypersonic missile has a different role.

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,360
Well, the question now is

247
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,320
what can happen in future scenarios

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,320
?  If, let's assume, the US succeeds in its resupply,

249
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,240
meaning, it sends the resupply to Israel as soon as possible,

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
then things will

251
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,000
stabilise, Israel's full

252
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,720
spectrum defence will be maintained and the

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,120

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,519
advantage of the element of surprise that Iran is gaining,

255
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,240
it will loose it and along with this, the

256
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,720
conflict here

257
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,480
can move from deescalation to diplomacy.  Along with

258
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,040
this, if we assume that

259
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,279
Israel's entire aeromissile system gets destroyed

260
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,519
within 10 to 12 days, then again if

261
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,920
you see here, Israel can suffer a lot of damage.

262
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,399
Their civilian areas will become

263
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,560
very vulnerable and because of this,

264
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,560
Israeli people may also

265
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
come out on the streets and start making different demands about what is happening.

266
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,160

267
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,399
Again, the worst case scenario here is that

268
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,720
Iranian missiles

269
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,959
could strike Israel's nuclear and chemical facilities,

270
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,959
and there is a

271
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,880
huge risk of a massive civilian and environmental disaster at this

272
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,720
time.  So, there is a lot to see at this time.

273
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,120
Look, ultimately the conclusion is

274
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,440
that Israel, which is known for

275
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,320
its defense shield, is

276
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,480
currently facing the greatest test in its history.  This is a

277
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,399
huge test

278
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,399
for Israel at the moment and it is

279
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,640
losing $285 million every night.  So

280
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
they have only 10 to 12 days of interceptors

281
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,200
left.  So the race right now is

282
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,279
not just about Iran's missiles

283
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,519
for Israel.  Here, many things like time, economics and global

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,959
diplomacy will have to be faced at this time.

285
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,880
Now let's see what happens

286
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,560
next regarding this.  But before I go, I have an interesting question for all of you.  Can you

287
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,440
tell me

288
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,279
which water bodies Israel has direct access to?

289
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,959
You have to tell us this from these options.

290
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,399
You all know the right answer to this, you will definitely

291
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,920
find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't

292
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
