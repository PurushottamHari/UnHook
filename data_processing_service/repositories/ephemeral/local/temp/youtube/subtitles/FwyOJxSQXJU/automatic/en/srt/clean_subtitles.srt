Hello Friends.  Friends, a report has come out from America which has created a stir in entire Israel. As you all know, Iran is also not behind during the Middle East war.  Iran has also launched a barrage of missiles on Israel.  Due to which Israel's entire air defense system has become overloaded. And because of this it is being said that Israel has a strategic missile of hardly 10 to 12 days. Like you might have heard about Arrow Defense System. So very little stock is left.  You can see this news is Israel running out of missile interceptors, bomb shell report claims defense system is near breaking point as war with Iran escalates.  So, let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly was said in the report and what could be its implications?  Because if this is true then many of the civilian areas here will become weak in the air defence system.  And Israel could suffer huge losses.  Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC for 2026 or 2027, must avail our Pratigya Foundation Batch.  If anyone has any kind of doubt in this, our team is sitting here, you can call on this phone number and all your doubts will be resolved.  Let's get started. First of all, if we tell you, the war currently going on between Iran and Israel has reached full scale.  It is a war.  Meaning, there should be no doubt that yes, things can increase further or decrease.  It's a war right now.  So a full scale missile conflict is going on at present.  Due to which Iran also acquired 100s of ballistic and hypersonic missiles.  Yes, it happened just yesterday. I had also made a video in which their hypersonic missile Fateh One was launched here.  And because of this, if you see, there are many targets in Israel, whether it is Haifa, Tel Aviv, the Northern Coast coastal regions, here also many intelligence centers of Israel were targeted, attempts were made to target all of them.  In view of this, Israel put its multi-tier missile defence system on overdrive. Meaning, it has been launched on a full scale so that maximum number of missiles coming from Iran can be intercepted and destroyed as quickly as possible so that Israel remains safe here. So this is what Israel is trying to do at the moment.  Well, before learning a little about this, you should know a little about Israel's missile defense ecosystem because here you will get to see a five-layered defense network.  First up is the Iron Dome.  You all must be knowing about Iron Dome. This is for short range rockets. Like 70 Km.  If we have to intercept and kill any rocket within the range of , then Israel uses this for that. Irono and most of this if you look at it, it's Hamas.  Apart from this, it was used against those who became Hezbollah in Lebanon. Then secondly, if we talk about medium range missiles, 40 to 300 km.  The one that intercepts and kills within the range of is David Sling.  And again these are all used by Israel only. Then the third, and this becomes very important, arrow two and arrow three.  Arrow Two and Arrow Three are basically for long range ballistic missiles.  1500 Km  Up to that, the interception arrow can do it.  And if you look at Arrow Three, it can also intercept exoatmospheric hypersonic missiles.  2000 Km More than the range.  Well, when it comes to exo atmospheric hypersonic, it means a simple thing.  Let's say it's Iran.  Iran launched a missile here. Launched a ballistic missile.  So what will happen here? Israel shoots it down in mid-course, when this ballistic missile goes out of the atmosphere.  It goes into space and detects Israel in the space itself and kills it, so we call it exo- atmospheric hypersonic.  So all these become very important for Israel. And the fifth layer here is deployed by the USA, you must have heard about the third system, Patriot and the third one, this is used for high altitude threads.  So USA is also helping Israel in a way here. Well now the question here is what is its financial implication ?  Look, whenever a missile is fired by Iran on Israel and when Israel intercepts it and kills and destroys it, the cost of each one is 2 to $3 million dollars.  Think about it.  The meaning depends on which of your defense systems is used.  According to that, the cost of killing one missile is $2 to $3 million. So according to the current rate of doses, if you look at it in terms of usage, here Israel is consuming 285 doses every night, that is, in one day. $25 sorry million dollars means $3 billion per day and with this launch rate, Iran is trying to target with precision using hypersonic weapons over Israel. Due to this, Israel has put its multiple interceptors on the line. What I mean to say is that Israel is currently trying to destroy more than 90% of its missiles and there are some missiles that fall on empty areas, so Israel leaves them because why waste money by intercepting them. So you will get to see the situation this time. Now the question is how long will this continue because you can already see that almost a week is going to pass and the war is going on continuously here. In view of this, in the report that has come out from the US Defense sources, it has been said that Israel has already used more than 400 of the Arrow type interceptors, I showed you this Arrow type, Arrow two and Arrow three, out of these interceptor missiles.  This means that it has already used a large part of its strategic stock pile and if things continue like this, then within 10 to 12 days its Arrow missile reserve will be exhausted and depleted. Once it is depleted, the threat to Israel will increase significantly, which means it is obvious that it will have to prioritize those particular targets, which means that Israel will now have to choose which missile to kill and which one to leave.  So it is possible that Israel will try to protect its strategic assets here and will shoot down all those missiles.  But there will be many such missiles of Iran which can fall in civilian areas of Israel, which again can cause a lot of damage to Israel.  So because of this, it is being considered a big threat for Israel. Well, what strategic vulnerabilities are emerging here?  Because if you see, Iran has already carried out many successful hits on Israel.  It's not like that.  Look, Israel is already doing this against Iran, but it is not that Iran is lagging behind.  If you see, Iran has already caused damage to the oil facility in Haifa, Israel. Apart from this, the Northern Intelligence Base was also attacked here in a way. The public is getting panicky.  I am getting fatigued in a way. People are also disturbed here because of the continuous sounding of sirens etc. And why is all this happening?  It is because Iran is playing very strategically here.  It is not like you can slowly launch one or two missiles every half hour throughout the day. This is not the case, what Iran is doing is launching 100 to 150 missiles here at one time within half an hour. So what will happen is that when you launch 100 to 150 missiles simultaneously, it is possible that 100 missiles will be intercepted here , destroyed, and the remaining 25 to 50 missiles will fall in the cities of Israel.  Because of which the loss will be greater.  Then apart from this, I told you about hypersonic, Iran has also used hypersonic now, which means the speed is tremendous and apart from this, the entire defense system here, the radar system, is currently under a lot of stress of Israel.  Well now the question here is what is America doing?  Will Trump get involved ?  Will Trump help here?   It is obvious that help is coming from behind. Considering this, there is a lot of stress on Israel's defense system.  What has the USA done?  Our third batteries and destroyers were deployed in the Mediterranean so that the US can also use its missiles to protect Israel.  Apart from this, it is also being said here that the already stopped pile lying at the European and NATO bases is being sent from there to Israel.  But now the problem is that it will take two to three weeks to arrive.  The arrow type system will take two to three weeks to arrive. And how much stock pile is left here?  Hardly 12 days.  So you can understand how vulnerable Israel has become at this time. And I have already told you about Iran's strategy that how Iran is combining everything at this time and means that Iran is forcing maximum power on Israel at this time and because of this, if you see, their main aim at this time has become to drain Israel's defense and in a way expose its vulnerability.  Because look, Israel was also doing similar things. Israel also destroyed Iran's overall defense system here so that its fighter jets could go inside Iran and come back after bombing. And if you see the hypersonic missile that Iran has used here, Fateh One, it alerts the traditional radar and hits it.  Apart from this, its speed is Mach 13 to 15.  Hughes and besides this, the treasury here can be changed in mid-flight and because of this Israel can get confused as to where the missile is going to fall, hence the hypersonic missile has a different role. Well, the question now is what can happen in future scenarios ?  If, let's assume, the US succeeds in its resupply, meaning, it sends the resupply to Israel as soon as possible, then things will stabilise, Israel's full spectrum defence will be maintained and the advantage of the element of surprise that Iran is gaining, it will loose it and along with this, the conflict here can move from deescalation to diplomacy.  Along with this, if we assume that Israel's entire aeromissile system gets destroyed within 10 to 12 days, then again if you see here, Israel can suffer a lot of damage. Their civilian areas will become very vulnerable and because of this, Israeli people may also come out on the streets and start making different demands about what is happening. Again, the worst case scenario here is that Iranian missiles could strike Israel's nuclear and chemical facilities, and there is a huge risk of a massive civilian and environmental disaster at this time.  So, there is a lot to see at this time. Look, ultimately the conclusion is that Israel, which is known for its defense shield, is currently facing the greatest test in its history.  This is a huge test for Israel at the moment and it is losing $285 million every night.  So they have only 10 to 12 days of interceptors left.  So the race right now is not just about Iran's missiles for Israel.  Here, many things like time, economics and global diplomacy will have to be faced at this time. Now let's see what happens next regarding this.  But before I go, I have an interesting question for all of you.  Can you tell me which water bodies Israel has direct access to?
