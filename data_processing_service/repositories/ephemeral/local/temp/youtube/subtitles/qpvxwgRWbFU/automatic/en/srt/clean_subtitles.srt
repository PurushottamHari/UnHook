I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  Now we should all be scared because Iran has fired a hypersonic missile here. There are reports of hypersonics over Israel, which is the most dangerous. Iran cannot fight the war for long. This is also true.  But the most dangerous thing is that reports are coming that America will attack Iran.  We will talk about geopolitics very well. But before that let me tell you that our amazing YouTube Plus Thumbnail SEO Plus Thumbnail course will use YouTube coupon code. This is only for â‚¹400.  There is a sale today and tomorrow. Because now we will end this offer. Then the sale will come after 3-4 months. Description link is in the comment box.  So here America is about to jump into the war.  This is absolutely confirmed.  You just need to understand when it will be 1 hour, 4 hours, tomorrow, the day after. But this will happen first.  Why?  Because a report has just come.  I was reading a report from CNN. So it is being said that Iran has made preparations. Iran is now eager to attack America's bases. He has got the missiles ready.  That means, now this was when Iran had the last choice.  And friends, now Iran has nothing left.  This is the climax of the war of 1979, which since the movie is running, its climax has happened in June 2025, 2025.  It is going to happen.  Now this picture has reached the end game.  Because friends, this was the last one. Brother of last rate resort kill America. But now America and Israel have left no option for Iran.  Israel dropped the bombs first.  It is still raining. Nuclear devastation.  America said that we will not touch Iran, but then yesterday America's Donald Trump said that he ran away from G7, which means he has come back and then says surrender unconditionally, he directly threatens Syed Khamenei that if you do not surrender then we know where you are hiding and in fact Israel had also ready a plan to kill Khamenei and on the other hand the US ambassador in Israel is saying that drop the nuclear bomb, history will remember you Donald Trump, and Donald Trump gets very happy with all these things, you know it may happen that the situation of this whole region becomes very bad and now this can become a regional war.  This is absolutely possible. Leave it on the table because now I feel that till the regime changes here, America, Israel do not place their stooges here, till they make us surrender, this Gael Khem game will not stop.  Are you understanding what I am saying?  What is going to happen now? A report came from Iran that Iran has made its missile completely ready.  He is in ready mode and now he will attack the American base. Now is it okay in this whole region?   There are 400 American troops in this entire region that you are seeing. There are 400 American troops.  America is continuously refueling its jets. Refuel the jet. America is fully prepared. Maybe America will launch pre-emptive strikes. America will attack Iran first. Iran will not get a chance to attack.  This is the same thing is n't it, this is a cat and mouse game.  Who is going to attack first?  If Iran attacks America first, America will suffer losses.  The people of America will die and then Don Trump will be in trouble.  And if America attacks Iran, which it is going to do, then God save Iran.  Because everybody is leaving Tehran anyway. Iran is currently on a suicide mission. But I appreciate his bravery. See, Iran is a friend of India. I do not agree with his government at all. Their government should be removed but an American and Israeli dominated government should not come into power because it will not be in our interest.  If an American dominated government comes into power in Iran then it will be a huge threat for us. This is not in India's interest.  Do you understand? So the biggest thing here is that just like you did, they completely suppressed the Mehsana Amini protest.  The people of Iran are very nice.  I have told you this before.  They are very awesome people.  But right now he is on a suicide mission.  They know they will lose.  Iran will not win.  They know it but are still fighting.  If you are still fighting then brother you have to appreciate your bravery. But isn't it true that there's a difference between bravery and stupidity?  Now friends, it seems to me that Iran is not fighting like this.  He has support. Whose support is there?  Look, obviously it's Russia and China.  Ok?  In fact Pakistan, now Pakistan has shown its place. You cannot trust the Pakistanis.  When he went and spoke to Iran, he must have told them in writing that we will come to help you.  But if Pakistan did not do this then they are finished.  No one is going to trust them and from here the support that Iran and Pakistan used to give so much to Pakistan is over.  That relationship is over and there is a crack.  There is already a crack.  Their Defence Minister, Deputy Shakar, says this in the Parliament out of fear.  I am totally scared like this.  Are you basking in the crumbs of America or no, no we never said anything like that and we would never say this, it is just a joke.  We are not going to do anything like this. We will never help Iran. And he came saying that we should not worry about you.  The nuclear bomb will stand with you. This is a Muslim bomb.  Is it okay ?  If there is any problem, if there is any such threat to any Islamic nation, we will attack.  Look, this is Pakistan, well the whole world knows the reality of Pakistan. Ok.  But look at Russia and China, Russia is busy in Ukraine.  Isn't it?  Russia is busy in Ukraine.  But this time Tehran is being attacked directly.  Their capital is being directly attacked.  This is not happening anywhere else.  If you want to destroy a country then you will attack its capital or the main city only.  And now Khamenei has given all his control to the military and told them to decide what to do. Ok?  Musad is active.  The CIA is active.  There is a constant struggle to buy their people.  Now Iran's top leadership is not for sale.  It will not be sold. Pakistan will be sold, these will not be sold. Ok?  They will fight.  You should listen to Khamini's speech. What he has said is that my life does not matter.  This movement will continue.  This war will continue. So he is telling that Iranians have a lot of courage.  But the thing is that you don't have any choice.  So this is the last one.  Meaning now if Iran is attacking American bases then this is the last resort. And then guys, the Red Sea is fine, right?  This Red Sea here, hey friend, this State of Hormos here and this entire Red Sea, now what is going to happen here, if he attacks the Red Sea, which he will do because he will also order the Houthis to fight a full-on war.  We have nothing left to lose now.  If America is going to kill us, we will explode.  Whatever we have, we will attack with all our might. This is the strategy of Iran at this time.  Ok?  And that's why he shot down the hypersonic missile. Hypersonic missile faster than the speed of sound. If China and Russia come forward in support of Iran, I think they should come forward.  Ok?  See America keeps its promise to Israel.  He said he promised Israel.  America stands by.  Not from today but from a long time ago.  Ever since Israel came into existence.  So America is standing by us.  But Russia and China are helping through the back door. Not coming forward.  Russia and China should support Iran.  And if this happens then you can understand that there will be a complete world war.  All the countries, all the countries will jump.  America will take the support of all these countries. So this is very important, you know, and at this time, whether Iran wins or loses, all the sympathy of the Islamic world is with Iran. Infact Jordan, UAE, Saudi Arabia are okay?  Even though these countries are supporting America to say this. But the sentiments of these people are directly towards Iran.  Because they see that the aggressor this time is Israel.  Iran is fighting what it is.  So it is possible that Iran may lose.  But this will become such an unstable country that instability will always remain here.  America will not win.  It will be difficult for America. America thinks that nothing is going to happen until you turn people against you. People here are not that against Iran.  It is possible  However, there is a large section which is against the government of Iran. Women too much because of the way in which they are oppressed.  But this does not mean that they want America to come and rule over us.  Then there will be rebellions here again. But right now the only option is that Iran will go to all out war against America and America will attack and in that case if China and Russia jump in then this war will become very big.
