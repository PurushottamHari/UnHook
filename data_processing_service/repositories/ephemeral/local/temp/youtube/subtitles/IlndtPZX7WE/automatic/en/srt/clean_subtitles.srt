Hello welcome to Career 247 I am Prashant Dhawan. Now recently a video of PM Modi has gone viral on the social media where he is saying that yes, I had rejected Donald Trump's invite properly. PM Modi told this to the people of OSA that since he wanted to go for the reopening of the Jagannath Temple, he told Donald Trump that sorry I will not be able to come to the US. Now usually, PM Modi did not say such things openly. But the way Trump has recently repeated the cease fire cease fire thing again and again, now PM Modi is also openly saying that yes, I had rejected Donald Trump's invite.  Now, on one hand, this development has taken place.  On the other hand, what I told you about.  Now, this thing has become official. What a strange thing the Government of Pakistan has said again. For his personal benefit, Donald Trump has lowered the standards of USA to such an extent that now who honours the US President for Nobel Peace Prize?  The Bankrupt Government of Pakistan.  Here you will see that recently the Government of Pakistan has tweeted that The Government of Pakistan recommends President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.  All the things that I told you are now proven in front of you.  I had told you that Asim Munir has decided that for the next one to two years he will praise Donald Trump and whatever loans Pakistan has received, they have received loans from the World Bank and the IMF. Loans have been received from the Asian Development Bank. Behind this, I would say that they are very successful.  The strategy is to stroke Donald Trump's ego.  Trump's family runs a crypto company. Benefit that crypto company.  Trump will be happy.  Say again and again that look, Trump is such a great man.  He stopped the war between India and Pakistan and hence he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Basically now Pakistan is openly accepting Donald Trump's version. And these people themselves have said that Donald Trump carried out diplomatic intervention.  During the Recent India Pakistan Crisis.  The situation could have been much worse and now the Pakistani government under Asim Munir sends the Nobel Peace Prize to Trump.  So now this thing is clear to a great extent.  Donald Trump is going to be very pro-Pakistan in this term and now PM Modi does not care whether Donald Trump feels bad or good.  Now PM Modi will also give open statements about Trump.  For example, listen to this here.  Friends, just two days ago I was in Canada for the G7 Summit and US President Trump called me. He said that now I have come to Canada.  So go via Washington.   We will eat together and talk. He extended the invitation with great insistence. I told the President of America thank you for the invitation.   It is very important for me to go to Mahaprabhu's land. Now this statement of PM Modi matters a lot because here you have to understand that recently India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had openly rejected all the claims of Donald Trump. Trump was saying that I used trade to stop India and Pakistan.  India openly rejected it and PM Modi also told Donald Trump on the phone that India has never accepted mediation. And if you people here are thinking that if Pakistan openly nominates Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, will Trump get the Nobel Prize ?  So the answer is no.  Here Trump also knows very well that he will not get the Nobel Peace Prize.  What will Trump do now that the mid-term elections that are going to take place in the USA will be very important for Trump during those elections when the American public will ask Trump that you used to say that as soon as you come to power, you will end the Ukraine-Russia war within 10 days, but you could not end that war.  On the contrary, we are now seeing that the issue of the war between Israel and Iran has come to the fore and most likely in times to come you will see that the USA will have to make a major military intervention in Iran. In that case, Donald Trump will use this argument for saving face before his people that look what I would have done, the entire world was on fire, on the one hand I stopped the nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and then I got the Ibrahim Accords done, look, Pakistan itself is saying today that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize, but I am a right wing leader by profession.  These people will not give me the Nobel Prize.  And see, Trump has also started tweeting continuously about this. For example, here you can see how many times in a tweet he mentions the Nobel Prize and says that he knows he will not get the Nobel Peace Prize. I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for this.  I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between India and Pakistan.  Nor will I get the Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the war between Serbia and Kosovo.  I don't know if this is something that's 5 or six years old. And then it says I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping peace between Egypt and Ethiopia.  So, he will pick up things from anywhere and say the same thing here. Look, I did so many great things. Now see, under his presidency, USA will most likely attack Iran.  It is possible that the USA might be forced to procure a tactical nuclear bomb as well, as is being discussed.  So before that, are you creating this cover for yourself that okay, I did whatever I had to do in Iran, but look at other places, I did so many good works and in return for that I did not even get the Nobel Peace Prize.  Now obviously here you can ask a question that these are amazing scenes. Pakistan is the same country about which Donald Trump once used to tweet that this country has betrayed the USA many times. This country takes the money.  But USA does not fight terrorism.  Donald Trump said a lot of bad things about Pakistan.  Now suddenly Trump is praising Pakistan.  Fox News, which is largely considered pro-Trump.  He is tweeting such that look, Pakistan has now officially nominated President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.  Will the people of USA accept this?  And will Trump's supporters also accept that it is not like this, Pakistan, a reputable country where Osama bin Laden was hiding, a non- epicentre of terrorism, a very corrupt country where there is no democracy, is today formally nominating Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, does Trump genuinely think that by taking the name of Pakistan, he will win the mid-term elections, look, I will say here that Trump is doing strange things. Recently his video came out in which he rejects the statement of Tulsi Gabbard who is currently the Intelligence Chief of USA.  The media persons asked Trump that 3 months ago Tulsi Gabbard had said that according to US intelligence, Iran is not making a nuclear bomb. Trump openly said that Tulsi Gabbard is saying wrong things.  They don't know what is really happening.  This is an amazing thing, look at this video, this is an amazing video in itself.  Here you will see that the intelligence community has no evidence. Just now the reporter said that the American Intelligence Community itself is saying that we do not have any evidence that Iran is building a nuclear bomb. Intelligence community wrong: Now in response to this Trump says, then my intelligence community is wrong.  Wonderful. Then Trump will further say that who in my intelligence community told me that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb. Intelligence Community National Intelligence Wrong is amazing, Xi Rong, the woman whom he himself has chosen to become the head of the National Intelligence and rejected the reports of all his intelligence community, FBI, CIA and I don't know what has happened to Trump at this time, is it age or is it the intoxication of money, is it the intoxication of power, but clearly something is very wrong with him.  I can see clearly.  They are saying that their own intelligence is wrong. Everything is wrong.  Asim Munir Pakistan is right here and I should get the Nobel Prize.  And I wouldn't be surprised if Trump faces a huge defeat in the mid-term elections.  Because whatever big promises they had made, they are not able to fulfill them properly till now.   Let's make a deal with China sometime.  Sometimes they say the deal is broken.  The poet says I will do it but I will not do it again.  Their plans were so big that by imposing tariffs on China, they would earn so much money that they would distribute it among the people of the US. They are no longer imposing tariffs on China. It's very weird that people are doing this today.  And finally, a question that may come to your mind is whether Trump will damage the overall India-US relations ?  Look, according to me, India-US relations are so important for both the countries that even Trump will not be able to properly damage both the relations. But yes I would say that Trump's policy is very pro-Pakistan.  This could backfire as past US presidents have burnt their hands. Looks like Trump will also burn his hands.  But this has to be said here.  Understanding the mentality of Donald Trump, Pakistan has given him this treatment that Trump is a narcissist man. Love yourself.  If someone praises them openly, they fall in love with them and cannot tolerate criticism from anywhere. You can say that he has a very un-American personality.  Usually Americans are quite the opposite.  They are quite open to criticism and debate etc.  But the government of Pakistan, its military, they understood how to impress Trump, give him some money, praise him, and today we can clearly see that if anyone has benefited the most in all this, it is the current establishment of Pakistan.  Even if Imran Khan dies in jail right now, Don Trump is not going to say anything.  The US keeps giving many statements regarding India's democracy. Whereas in Pakistan, the way these people dismantled a political party.   The US is completely silent about the fact that a leader was put in jail.  So again in the coming times we will have to see what Trump does in Iran.  If some updates come then I will keep bringing you updated videos in the future.
