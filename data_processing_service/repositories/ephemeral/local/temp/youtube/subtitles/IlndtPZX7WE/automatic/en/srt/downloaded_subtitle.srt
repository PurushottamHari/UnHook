00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,480
Hello welcome to Career 247 I am

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,719
Prashant Dhawan. Now recently a video of PM Modi has gone

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,840
viral on the social media

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,480
where he is saying that yes, I had

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,439
rejected Donald Trump's invite

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,520
properly. PM Modi

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,160
told this to the people of OSA that since he

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,240

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,119
wanted to go for the reopening of the Jagannath Temple, he told Donald Trump

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,000
that sorry I will not be able to come to the US. Now

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,800
usually, PM Modi did not say such things openly.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,280
But the way Trump has

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,760
recently repeated the cease fire cease fire thing

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
again and again, now PM Modi is also

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,800
openly saying that yes, I had

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,840
rejected Donald Trump's invite.  Now, on

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,680
one hand, this development has taken place.  On the other hand,

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
what I told you about.  Now, this thing has

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,879
become official.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,039
What a strange thing the Government of Pakistan has said again.

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,000
For his personal benefit, Donald Trump has

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,960
lowered the standards of USA to such an extent that now

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,680

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
who honours the US President for Nobel Peace Prize?  The Bankrupt

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,320
Government of Pakistan.  Here you will see that

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
recently the Government of Pakistan has tweeted that

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,040
The Government of Pakistan

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,080
recommends President Donald Trump for the

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,720
2026 Nobel Peace Prize.  All the things that

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,040
I told you are now proven in

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,000
front of you.  I had told you that Asim

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Munir has decided that for the

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,600
next one to two years he

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
will praise Donald Trump and whatever

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,680
loans Pakistan has received, they have received loans from the World Bank and the

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,680
IMF.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
Loans have been received from the Asian Development Bank.

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,360
Behind this, I would say that they are very successful.  The

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,840
strategy is to

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,240
stroke Donald Trump's ego.  Trump's

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,479
family runs a crypto company.

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,360
Benefit that crypto company.  Trump

43
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,520
will be happy.  Say again and again that look, Trump is

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,240
such a great man.  He stopped the war between

45
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,280
India and Pakistan and hence he

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,079
should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Basically now

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,240
Pakistan is openly accepting Donald Trump's version.

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,200
And these people themselves have

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,760
said that Donald Trump

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,840
carried out diplomatic intervention.  During the Recent India

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,800
Pakistan Crisis.  The situation

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
could have been much worse and now the

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,120
Pakistani government under Asim Munir sends the

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Nobel Peace Prize to Trump.  So now this

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,560
thing is clear to a great extent.  Donald Trump is

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,879
going to be very pro-Pakistan in this term

57
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,360
and now PM Modi does

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,760
not care whether Donald Trump feels bad or

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,319
good.  Now PM Modi will also

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,120
give open statements about Trump.  For

61
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,959
example, listen to this here.  Friends,

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,920
just two days ago

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:53,519
I was in Canada for the G7 Summit and

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,319
US President Trump called me.

65
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,480
He said that

66
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,280
now I have come to Canada.  So go via Washington.   We

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,360

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:12,080
will eat together and talk.

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:16,000
He extended the invitation with great insistence.

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:21,680
I told the President of America

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,080
thank you for the invitation.   It is

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,000

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:32,480
very important for me to go to Mahaprabhu's land.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,319
Now this statement of PM Modi

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,720
matters a lot because here you have to

76
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,760
understand that recently India's Foreign

77
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,239
Secretary Vikram Misri had openly

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,640
rejected all the claims of Donald Trump.

79
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,239
Trump was saying that I

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
used trade to

81
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
stop India and Pakistan.  India

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,560
openly rejected it and PM Modi

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,120
also told Donald Trump on the phone that

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
India has never accepted mediation.

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,480
And if you people here are thinking

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,640
that if Pakistan openly

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
nominates Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, will

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,840
Trump get the Nobel Prize

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,159
?  So the answer is no.  Here

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
Trump also knows very well that he will

91
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,599
not get the Nobel Peace Prize.  What will Trump do now that the

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,519
mid-term elections that are going to take place in the USA will be

93
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,519

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,919
very important for Trump

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,440
during those elections when the American public will

96
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,240
ask Trump that you used to say that as soon as

97
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,040
you come to power,

98
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,600
you will end the Ukraine-Russia war within 10 days, but you could

99
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,320
not end that war.  On the contrary, we are now seeing

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,000
that the issue of the war between Israel and Iran has come to the fore

101
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
and most

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,479
likely in times to come you will see that the

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,880
USA will have to make a major military intervention

104
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,960
in Iran. In that case,

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
Donald Trump will

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,360
use this argument for saving face before his people that

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,840
look what I would have done, the entire world was on

108
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
fire, on the one hand

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,240
I stopped the nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and then I got the

110
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,400
Ibrahim Accords done, look, Pakistan

111
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
itself is saying today that I should

112
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
get the Nobel Peace Prize, but I

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,639
am a right wing leader by profession.  These people will

114
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,960
not give me the Nobel Prize.  And

115
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,800
see, Trump has also started tweeting continuously about this.

116
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,759
For example, here you

117
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
can see how many times in a tweet he

118
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,160
mentions the Nobel Prize and says that he knows

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,880
he will not get the Nobel Peace Prize.

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,520
I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize

121
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,759
for this.  I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize

122
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,160
for stopping the war between India and

123
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,479
Pakistan.  Nor will I get the Nobel Peace Prize

124
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,520
for stopping the war between Serbia

125
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,680
and Kosovo.  I don't know if this is something that's 5 or six years old.

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,080
And then it says I won't

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,479
get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping peace

128
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,199
between Egypt and Ethiopia.  So, he will

129
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,680
pick up things from anywhere and say the same thing here.

130
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,360
Look, I did so many great things.

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,600
Now see, under his presidency,

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
USA will most likely attack Iran.  It is

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
possible that the

134
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,320
USA might be forced to procure a tactical

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,960
nuclear bomb as well, as is being discussed.  So

136
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,199
before that, are you creating this cover for yourself that

137
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,600
okay, I did whatever I had to do in Iran,

138
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,160
but look at other places, I did

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,560
so many good works and in return for that

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
I did not even get the Nobel Peace Prize.  Now

141
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,199
obviously here you

142
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,240
can ask a question that these are amazing scenes.

143
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,880
Pakistan is the same country about which Donald

144
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,080
Trump once used to tweet that this

145
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,520
country has betrayed the USA many times.

146
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,080
This country takes the money.  But USA does

147
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,639
not fight terrorism.  Donald Trump

148
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,960

149
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,520
said a lot of bad things about Pakistan.  Now suddenly Trump is

150
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,080
praising Pakistan.  Fox News, which is

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,400
largely considered pro-Trump.  He is

152
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,160
tweeting such that look, Pakistan has

153
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,120
now officially nominated

154
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,880
President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel

155
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Peace Prize.  Will the people of USA

156
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,840
accept this?  And will

157
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,240
Trump's supporters also accept

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,280
that it is not like this,

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,080
Pakistan, a reputable country where

160
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,479
Osama bin Laden was hiding, a non-

161
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,120
epicentre of terrorism, a very corrupt

162
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,039
country where there is no democracy, is

163
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
today formally nominating

164
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,520
Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, does

165
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,919
Trump genuinely think that by

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,000
taking the name of Pakistan, he will win the mid-term

167
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,960
elections, look, I will

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,120
say here that Trump is doing strange things.

169
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,319
Recently his video came out in

170
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,599
which he rejects the statement of Tulsi Gabbard who is currently the

171
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,440
Intelligence Chief of USA.  The

172
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,160
media persons

173
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,039
asked Trump that 3 months ago Tulsi

174
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,919
Gabbard had said that

175
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,960
according to US intelligence, Iran is not making a nuclear bomb.

176
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,000
Trump openly said that Tulsi

177
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,479
Gabbard is saying wrong things.  They don't know

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,720
what is really happening.  This is an amazing thing,

179
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,319
look at this video, this is an amazing

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
video in itself.  Here you will see that the

181
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,280
 

182
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,039
intelligence community has no evidence.

183
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,319
Just now the reporter said that the American

184
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,319
Intelligence Community itself is saying that

185
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,800
we do not have any evidence that Iran is

186
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,680
building a nuclear bomb.

187
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Intelligence community wrong:

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,039
Now in response to this Trump says, then

189
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,120
my intelligence community is wrong.  Wonderful.

190
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,000
Then Trump will further say that

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,160
who in my intelligence community told me that

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,479
Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.

193
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Intelligence Community

194
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,599
National Intelligence

195
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,839
Wrong is amazing, Xi Rong, the woman whom

196
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,200
he himself has chosen to become the head of the

197
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,680
National Intelligence and rejected the reports of

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,480
all his intelligence community, FBI, CIA

199
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,320
and I don't know

200
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,760
what has happened to Trump at this time, is it age

201
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,760
or is it the intoxication of money, is it the intoxication of power,

202
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,839
but clearly something is very wrong

203
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
with him.  I can see clearly.  They are

204
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
saying that their own intelligence is wrong.

205
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,040
Everything is wrong.  Asim Munir Pakistan is

206
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,279
right here and I should

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,560
get the Nobel Prize.  And I wouldn't be

208
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,120
surprised if Trump

209
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,680
faces a huge defeat in the mid-term elections.  Because

210
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,080
whatever big promises they had made, they are

211
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,120
not able to fulfill them properly till now.   Let's make a

212
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,440
deal with China sometime.  Sometimes they

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,080
say the deal is broken.  The poet says I will do it but I will

214
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,480
not do it again.  Their plans were so

215
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,200
big that by imposing tariffs on China, they would

216
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,160
earn so much money that they would distribute it among the people of the US.

217
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,040
They are no longer imposing tariffs on China.

218
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,959
It's very weird that people are

219
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,120
doing this today.  And finally,

220
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,760
a question that may come to your mind is

221
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
whether Trump will damage the overall India-US relations

222
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,480
?  Look, according to me,

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,560
India-US relations are so important

224
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
for both the countries that even Trump will

225
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,519
not be able to properly damage both the relations.

226
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,480
But yes I would say that Trump's

227
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
policy is very pro-Pakistan.  This

228
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
could backfire as past US

229
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,600
presidents have burnt their hands.

230
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Looks like Trump will also burn his hands.  But

231
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,279
this has to be said here.  Understanding the

232
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,920
mentality of Donald Trump, Pakistan has given

233
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,720
him this treatment

234
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,680
that Trump is a narcissist man.

235
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,839
Love yourself.  If someone

236
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,760
praises them openly, they fall in love with them

237
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,920
and

238
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,000
cannot tolerate criticism from anywhere.

239
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,240
You can say that he has a very un-American

240
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
personality.  Usually Americans are

241
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,959
quite the opposite.  They are quite

242
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,120
open to criticism and debate etc.  But the

243
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,279
government of Pakistan, its

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,680
military, they understood

245
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,720
how to impress Trump,

246
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,200
give him some money, praise him, and today we can

247
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,279
clearly see that

248
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,440
if anyone has benefited the most in all this, it is the

249
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,320
current establishment of Pakistan.  Even if

250
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,640
Imran Khan dies in jail right now,

251
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,200
Don Trump is not going to say anything.  The

252
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,279
US keeps giving many statements regarding India's democracy.

253
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,360
Whereas

254
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,760
in Pakistan, the way these people

255
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,920
dismantled a political party.   The

256
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,000

257
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,600
US is completely silent about the fact that a leader was put in jail.  So again

258
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,760
in the coming times we will have to see

259
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
what Trump does in Iran.  If some updates come

260
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,320
then I will

261
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,640
keep bringing you updated videos in the future.  Look, I believe that

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,640
if you are

263
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,480
not using Artificial Intelligence in your work today, then you are

264
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,760
living in a different era because with the

265
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,079
help of AI, you can do many jobs.

266
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,760
You can make a lot of money.   You

267
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,600
can upskill yourself.  For

268
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,480
example, if I want to show

269
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,880
that Captain America is

270
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,480
eating Vada Pav in a busy street of Mumbai and

271
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,200
a very attractive text is written on it '

272
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,160
Yummy', then I can easily do this by

273
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,200
entering the correct 'P'.  And here you

274
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,519
can see it was just that easy,

275
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,560
you can make many variants of it.  If I

276
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,640
want to move this image, then I can do it in the

277
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,360
way you can see on your screen.

278
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,000
I can make

279
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,480
this image move with the help of a lot of generative AI software.  I

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,880
can create a story.

281
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,760
I can pretty much do anything.  And this is

282
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,880
just one small, I mean one very

283
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,360
small, aspect of generative AI.

284
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,360
With the help of generative AI, you can write books.

285
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
You can create personalities.

286
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,200
