I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddharth Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, I actually went to the event so I recorded the lecture in the morning and left and you know that you will get all the updates here first.  First of all subscribe right now, it will take just a second to do it.  So friend, I could n't see it.  So now that I have come, a lot of developments have taken place regarding Iran and Israel. I will also tell you what will happen next.   In my opinion, this may also change.  But I will tell you what I think.  So first of all, let me share some updates with you about how Iran has caused havoc.  Operation Midnight Hammer.   The night has been hammered. Someone comes to your house and troubles you.  Your father-in-law then says, oh no no, brother we want peace.  We just want peace.  Make friends with us.  This is what is happening.  This is what Peter Hett is saying.  They are saying that we have killed Iran but we want peace.  Hey friend what are you talking about brother?  Look, Iran will lose.  Will lose very soon if Iran attacks.  Their state television is saying that now everyone, let me first tell you about Iran 's response, what Iran ultimately said.  Ok?  First of all, you know, everybody is saying this, Iran's state television has said that now every American citizen and military personnel is on target.  That means no one is safe, we will kill everyone.  And this is a blatant violation.  He has said that this is a savage assault.  This is a savage assault that America has carried out.  They entered our house and killed us.  And brother, just watch the Pentagon briefing.  Brother, I mean I agree with America, whatever you may say, however Iran has said a very good thing that you cannot defeat knowledge and see, there have been a lot of developments, I will bring a lecture on them one by one tomorrow, the first development is maybe a nuclear leak, maybe I am not sure but there was an article in Indian Express, everybody is not sure, that means nobody is sure whether it is a nuclear leak or not, but if you attack a nuclear site, then what do you think, if there is nuclear material in it, then there is a possibility of a nuclear leak.  The possibility of radiation leak is being said.  Ok? And the second thing is that America has shown that you have better technology than them.  They have amazing technology. They can hit anywhere, friend. You should look at them.  This is said because look what China is doing?  China is building its base all over the world.  This is the advantage of the base.  You are not safe anywhere in the world. Where is America, where is Iran, I followed you across seven seas. Donald Trump must be singing this song. Zulmi meri jaan and it took a full 18 hour flight here to Diego Garcia.  Ok ?  And what happened after that is very bad for Iran.  I will remember this for seven lives. But Iran will not bow down.  Iran will retaliate.  He will retaliate till the last moment. Because if he does not retaliate then the regime will change.  And one way you can say this is, wait a minute.  You can also say that this is a huge escalation.  This is a point of aggression.  So let me tell you.  So, first of all it is said here that America has directly pushed itself into the front line of aggression and that you are standing in the forefront.   You are standing on the front line, now you should forget that you will survive.  If we see anything related to America, we will kill them. Why didn't you say shoot me?  At the same time it is said here that terrible devastation has happened in Nathansh and Isvahan. They also have two reactors in Busher.  He has hit there as well. Well let me tell you one more thing, it is being said that this was a BBC report and Iran is saying that brother, we did not suffer even a single loss. Why?  Because trucks were seen leaving Fado. That means they have already shifted all the stuff. So in a way the for two was empty which you hit and your money is just wasted.  We have already shifted all this stuff.  That means, in a way, Iran has indirectly accepted that yes, we were planning for nuclear weapons and what it has said is a blatant interpretation of international law, NPT, IAEA, Mehndi Mohammad, who is a senior advisor to Mohammad Ghalibaf.  He has said something very nice.  You can't bomb knowledge.  Wow, what a quote, okay you will kill, you will burn everything, you will destroy it, but now how will you kill the knowledge, it is amazing friend, it is good, you can use it, you cannot bomb knowledge and the site which we had already evacuated long ago and what has Donald Trump said, he has said the same thing that Iran is the bully of the Middle East and now you have to have peace or else rest in peace, you will be in peace so do peace and if you don't do it then future attacks will come, leader Nia has even showered a garland of flowers on Don Trump. Isn't it?  Netan Yahoo said a very good thing.  Brother, this too, well we too had said that without brother there is no love.  So son, as long as there is strength, there will be peace.  But friends, tell me one thing, power does not mean that you can blow away anyone.  Isn't it? See, Israel is an aggressor.  You will have to accept this.  There could have been other ways.  I think that if Iran had allowed the US talks to take place once, then perhaps their nuclear program could have come under America. But Israel killed him and Israel killed him and after that you saw his repression.  Now what will happen with this?  What will happen because of this is that now this whole world is in danger. Prime Minister Modi ji talked to the President of Iran.  He said that immediate de-escalation should be done right now and Iran has now met Vladimir Putin.  Nothing will happen.  He will not be able to do anything.  Vladimir Putin is already busy in war.  Ok?  Now let's see what it offers.  But now this has become a question of life and death.  You should assume this. So first of all Operation Midnight Hammer is a good name Guru and the operation is highly classified, Pentagon said that no one knew about it.  Dan Kane, Chairman of the Chiefs of Joint Staff, says that it was so classified that very few people knew about it.  These were the seven B-2 bombers which flew for 18 hours.  Is it okay? They took off from Diego Garcia at different bases and the American submarines launched two by two dozen, or 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles, at the targets. Iran's surface to air missile remained lying there.  I don't know what he was doing.   It means they did not use their missiles at all.  Ok?  Now there are two reasons for this, either their system is infectious or it does not make any difference to them because brother we have evacuated.  Kill him.  Is n't it?  What can we do?  So this is the thing. Now friends, I don't understand why many people like Pakistan are saying this, Iranians will chase them and kill them. You can't say anything, my brother.  That Asim Muni has come after having lunch.  He has been given a memorized script to say condemn it and we will take care of the rest.  Everything has come from America, everything has come from Pakistan.  And now you will see what happens next.  Then here the Pentagon says Months of Planning.  Wow Months of telling that strikes took months and weeks of planning.  Now tell me this.  What is he saying?  Months of Planning Been planning for months.  Brother what do you want to say?  You have been talking to Iran for months.  This means that Israel was not involved at all.  You were involved.  If you are saying this then we have been planning this for a week now.  If you were planning this for months, then it means the entire plan to kill was yours. Israel has just used the same memorized script.  Because on one side brother, things are going on.  It could be possible, brother, that he is the one who caught me.  Gave me the powder.  Here they were giving powder to Iran and then after that, they mixed poison in the powder and at the end they told them to eat it.  So this is it.  And see RLEs in Israel.  America has said this directly. and well.  There is no problem in that you and here I have said the same thing about Operation Iran that it was a bold and brilliant move.  Donald Trump has been praised a lot here.  And it has been said that none of our troops or civilians have been affected. Ok so this is the thing.  After that, Iran's Revolutionary Guard, which comes under its supreme leader, has spoken.  Comini has also hidden in a bunker and no one knows in which bunker he is hiding. They have cut off all communications regarding his location. He is not talking to anyone.  So I am saying that Iran will not be able to achieve anything with this regrettable response.  But it can cause huge damage.  He may not be able to attack America but he will attack American bases.  It can attack the Gulf region and if the Gulf region is attacked then the entire region will become destabilized.  So you accept this and let's see what happens next. But let me tell you my analysis.   I will tell you in a little while.  First let us look at the updates.  As for the rest, when the IDF was asked, Iran is saying that it has shifted its entire nuclear program somewhere else. So the IDF, Israeli Defense Forces said that look, we don't know yet.  It's too early to say.  We will look into it and evaluate it.  Ok. So this is the thing.  After that the Iranian Foreign Minister said that now we will have to respond. Abbas Saraksh We don't have any other choice which is right. Response to you I myself agree that Iran cannot back down now.  Not you, I am telling you how, I mean you should see, either that country itself is very weak. He doesn't have anything.  But if he has even one missile, he will hit.  He will do anything that will put America in trouble.  Isn't it?  What if the entire program has been shifted?  Now tomorrow I will give you all the lectures on this topic one by one.  Turkey, you know, Turkey has said that look, this conflict can become wide open.  Turkey does n't get along well with Iran.  But it is not made from Turkey or Saudi Arabia at all.  At least he can see it from Iran.  Ok?  So this is the thing.  Chinese experts say that the attack on the Iranian nuclear site is not enough to destroy them.  Now brother what will be the amount then?  Saudi Arabia is on alert after this attack and Iran's foreign minister will meet Putin in Istanbul on June 22.  Ok? So this is the thing.  Putin is currently in Moscow.  So these two are going to meet today.  PM Modi has spoken. Russia has said that Trump has started a new war without any reason.  This is true.  And now no one knows what is going to happen in Iran. Because see, this was never a direct attack on Iran.  Ok?  197 Till date America has never attacked Iran in such a way that you killed it directly. So this happened during World War Two. So that too happened briefly when Iran came to America's side.  But this is absolutely again the UK is evacuating its British nationals from Israel because now you know obviously the missiles are going to rain down and it's going to start from tonight itself. Everyone from Bahrain, Iran, Germany has said that brother, please talk to us immediately. You talk about America, Israel and Iran and that is it.   Is it okay?  Pakistan has condemned America. Iran says wow, this is amazing.  He is saying right to defend. Pakistan is talking to Iran.  Well, I did n’t read this.  The right to defend itself. Pakistan's Foreign Minister says, brother, Asif Munir will be killed by hanging him upside down.  You will see, he will put it in front of the cannon.  He will blow you away  He will launch you with the missile itself. So the post says that Pakistan has condemned the American attacks.   I enjoyed the joke.  I want to give this pleasure to everyone. Which brand, I mean you should see and ask them and Israel's airspace is being said to be opened on Sunday itself, that means today then friends Lebanese and rest of the people from around the world have come, basically the response but now what will happen next, I think it will go on like this for about a week, Iran will get tired, America will not get tired, Iran will attack, definitely it has told all its ministers that we will not pack down, where will it attack?  Can attack the Red Sea. Iran's proxies may be active. India is also in danger.  Friends, there is a huge danger from this.  Proxies can appear here as well. Pakistan has rightfully come on Iran's red list.  The one in Balochistan may be more unstable. Energy prices may go up.  But because America has jumped into the war, America will attack with double force.  And if that happens, Iran will not be able to survive.  I think Iran will come to the table in a week or two, or maybe even before that. Because if Iran attacks and then America attacks with more force then there will be devastation in Iran.  Do you understand?  America, you are not directly attacking America.   If you are attacking on the basis then they will make all of them good.  will turn against Iran. Iran has such a difficult decision to make at this time. But it is the same person, his Foreign Minister, he does not have a choice. They must be killed.  Very probably there is zero 1% chance.  And if this happens then it will be a miracle that Iran comes to the table. But he will come.  It is the same, that they will come but after getting beaten they will tell all the secrets but unless you are beaten then the police says that if you had told all this in advance then the same thing would have happened with Iran, he will definitely come to the table, now it is possible that Iran fires the missile and says that okay we fired the missile, we have taken the revenge because America also says that okay you fired the missile, you have satisfied your ego, you have given an answer to the people, forgive the fight, you shifted your nuclear program there, we fired the missile, the game is over we are done with the drama, now let's sit and eat Vada Pav and have tea, now tell me what do you want?  So ultimately there will be a compromise because if I told you the same thing that the visa will be changed, then it will happen that if it continues for long and people see the devastation, then people will rise against their government.  Now the public has to respond, the Supreme Leader of Iran has to tell the people that we are strong.  Ok? And now if you say too much that we are powerful then the public will say, brother, we do not have the power.  Let us live.  So Iran will play on this only. These things will continue like this for about a week and a half.  But I think ultimately there will be peace talks.  There will be an agreement, Iran will have to come to the table because Iran is much weaker than America and Israel. When America can sit so far away and attack anything, then imagine that if there is a direct attack, then America can create a lot of problems. Isn't it?  So what do you think?  Let me know in the comment box.  Stay happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant News signing off.
