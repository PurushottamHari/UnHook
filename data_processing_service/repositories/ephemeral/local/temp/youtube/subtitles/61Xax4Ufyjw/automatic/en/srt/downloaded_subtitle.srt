1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,319
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,680
My name is Siddharth Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,760
Welcome to Study Gloss.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,280
Friends, I actually went to the event so

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,960
I recorded the lecture in the morning and left

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,679
and you know that you will get all the updates

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,480
here first.  First of all

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:22,240
subscribe right now, it will

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,000
take just a second to do it.  So friend, I could

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,000
n't see it.  So now that I have come, a lot of

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,760
developments have taken place regarding Iran and Israel.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,160
I will also tell you what will happen next.   In

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,680
my opinion, this may also change.  But I will

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,440
tell you what I think.  So first of all, let

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,480
me share some updates with you about

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,239
how Iran has caused

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,640
havoc.  Operation Midnight Hammer.   The

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,640
night has been hammered.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,960
Someone comes to your house and troubles you.  Your

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,239
father-in-law then says, oh no no,

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,199
brother we want peace.  We just

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,199
want peace.  Make friends with us.  This is what is

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,720
happening.  This is what Peter Hett is saying.  They are saying

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,439
that we have killed Iran

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,880
but we want peace.  Hey friend what are you talking about

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,680
brother?  Look, Iran

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,799
will lose.  Will lose very soon if Iran

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,119
attacks.  Their state television is saying

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,680
that now everyone, let me first tell you about Iran

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,840
's response, what Iran ultimately

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,320
said.  Ok?  First of all, you know,

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,479
everybody is saying this, Iran's state

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,159
television has said that now every American

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,600
citizen

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,560
and military personnel is on target.  That means no

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,960
one is safe, we will kill everyone.  And

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,720
this is a blatant violation.  He has said

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,200
that this is a savage assault.  This is a savage assault

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,560
that America has carried out.  They entered our house and

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,560
killed us.  And brother, just

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,360
watch the Pentagon briefing.  Brother, I mean I agree with

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,119
America, whatever you may say, however

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
Iran has said a very good thing that

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
you cannot defeat knowledge and see, there have been

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,759
a lot of developments, I will

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,719
bring a lecture on them one by one tomorrow, the first

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,640
development is maybe a nuclear leak, maybe

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,039
I am not sure but there was an article in Indian Express, everybody is not sure, that

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,879

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,680
means nobody is sure whether it is a

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,360
nuclear leak or not, but if you

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
attack a nuclear site, then

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,680
what do you think, if there is

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,319
nuclear material in it,

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,840
then there is a possibility of a nuclear leak.  The

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:32,400
possibility of radiation leak is being said.  Ok?

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,360
And the second thing is that America has

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,120
shown that you have better

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,080
technology than them.  They have amazing technology.

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
They can hit anywhere, friend.

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,599
You should look at them.  This is said because

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
look what China is doing?  China is

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,519
building its base all over the world.  This

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,080
is the advantage of the base.  You are not safe anywhere in the world.

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,040
Where is America, where is Iran,

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,879
I followed you across seven seas.

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Donald Trump must be singing this song.

68
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,120
Zulmi meri jaan and it

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,800
took a full 18 hour flight here to Diego Garcia.  Ok

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,680
?  And what happened after that is very bad for Iran.  I will

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,360
remember this for seven lives.

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,239
But Iran will not bow down.  Iran

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,959
will retaliate.  He will retaliate till the last moment.

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,680
Because if he does not retaliate then the

75
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,080
regime will change.  And one way

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,120
you can say this is, wait a minute.  You

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,280
can also say that this is a huge

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
escalation.  This is a point of aggression.  So let

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,560
me tell you.  So, first of all

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,879
it is said here that America has directly

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,959
pushed itself into the front line of aggression and that

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,440
you are standing in the forefront.   You are

83
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,680
standing on the front line, now you should forget

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,920
that you will survive.  If we

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
see anything related to America, we will kill them.

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,680
Why didn't you say shoot me?  At the same

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,239
time it is said here that terrible devastation has happened in Nathansh and Isvahan.

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,720

89
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,440
They also have two reactors in Busher.  He has hit there as well.

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,319
Well let me tell you one more thing, it is being said that

91
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,720
this was a BBC report and Iran is

92
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,959
saying that brother, we did not suffer even a single loss.

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,080
Why?  Because trucks were

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,480
seen leaving Fado.

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,439
That means they have already shifted all the stuff.

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,200
So in a way the for two was empty

97
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,519
which you hit and your money is just

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,639
wasted.  We have already

99
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,199
shifted all this stuff.  That means, in a way,

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,080
Iran has indirectly accepted

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,680
that yes, we were planning for nuclear weapons

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,880
and what it has said is a

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,600
blatant interpretation of international law, NPT,

104
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,240
IAEA, Mehndi Mohammad, who is a senior

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
advisor to Mohammad Ghalibaf.  He has

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,720
said something very nice.  You can't

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,880
bomb knowledge.  Wow, what a quote, okay you will

108
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
kill, you will burn everything, you will destroy it,

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
but now how will you kill the knowledge, it is

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,919
amazing friend, it is good, you can use

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,840
it, you cannot bomb knowledge and the site which

112
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,320
we had already evacuated long

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,919
ago and what has Donald Trump said,

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,600
he has said the same thing that Iran is the

115
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,639
bully of the Middle East and now you have to have peace

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
or else rest in peace, you will be in peace so do peace

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,039
and if you don't do it then future attacks will

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
come, leader Nia has even showered a garland of flowers on Don Trump.

119
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,199
Isn't it?  Netan Yahoo

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,880
said a very good thing.  Brother, this too, well

121
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,440
we too had said that without brother there is no

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,600
love.  So son, as long as there is strength, there will be

123
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,080
peace.  But friends,

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
tell me one thing, power does not mean that

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
you can blow away anyone.  Isn't it?

126
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,960
See, Israel is an aggressor.  You will have to accept this.  There

127
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,280
could have been other ways.  I

128
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,039
think that if Iran had allowed the US talks to take place

129
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
once, then perhaps

130
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,280
their nuclear program could have come under America.

131
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,919
But Israel killed him and Israel

132
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
killed him and after that you saw his

133
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,479
repression.  Now what will happen with this?  What will happen because of this is that

134
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,520
now this whole world is in danger.

135
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,199
Prime Minister Modi ji

136
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
talked to the President of Iran.  He

137
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,080
said that immediate de-escalation should be done right now

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,600
and Iran has now

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,039
met Vladimir Putin.  Nothing will happen.  He will

140
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,039
not be able to do anything.  Vladimir Putin is

141
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
already busy in war.  Ok?  Now let's

142
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,280
see what it offers.  But now this has become a

143
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,919
question of life and death.  You should assume this.

144
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,199
So first of all Operation Midnight

145
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,039
Hammer is a good name Guru and the operation is highly

146
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,680
classified, Pentagon said that no one

147
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,479
knew about it.  Dan Kane,

148
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,240
Chairman of the Chiefs of Joint Staff, says that it was

149
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,520
so classified that very few people

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,440
knew about it.  These were the seven B-2 bombers which

151
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,080
flew for 18 hours.  Is it okay?

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,360
They took off from Diego Garcia at different bases and the

153
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,560
American submarines launched two by two dozen, or

154
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,280
24 Tomahawk cruise missiles, at the targets.

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,600
Iran's surface to air missile remained

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,680
lying there.  I don't know what he was doing.   It

157
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,919
means they did

158
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,479
not use their missiles at all.  Ok?  Now there are two reasons for this,

159
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,240
either their system is infectious or it does

160
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
not make any difference to them because brother

161
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
we have evacuated.  Kill him.  Is

162
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,199
n't it?  What can we do?  So this is the thing.

163
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,560
Now friends,

164
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,479
I don't understand why many people like Pakistan are saying this,

165
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
Iranians will chase them and kill them.

166
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,560
You can't say anything, my brother.  That Asim

167
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,080
Muni has come after having lunch.  He has been

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
given a memorized script to say condemn it and

169
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,199
we will take care of the rest.  Everything has come

170
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,240
from America, everything has come from Pakistan.  And now you

171
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,240
will see what happens next.  Then

172
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,720
here the Pentagon says Months of

173
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,479
Planning.  Wow Months of telling that

174
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,919
strikes took months and weeks of

175
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,639
planning.  Now tell me this.  What is he

176
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,240
saying?  Months of Planning Been

177
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,840
planning for months.  Brother what do you

178
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,919
want to say?  You have been talking

179
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,400
to Iran for months.  This means that Israel was

180
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,240
not involved at all.  You were involved.  If you are saying this then

181
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,080
we have been planning this for a week now.  If you were

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,680
planning this for months, then

183
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,400
it means the entire plan to kill was yours.

184
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,960
Israel has just used the same memorized

185
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,680
script.  Because on one side brother,

186
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,560
things are going on.  It could be possible, brother, that he is the one who

187
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,280
caught me.  Gave me the powder.  Here they were

188
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
giving powder to Iran and then after that, they

189
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,960
mixed poison in the powder and at the end they told them to

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,160
eat it.  So this is it.  And see

191
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,919
RLEs in Israel.  America has said this directly.

192
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,560
and well.  There is no

193
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
problem in that you and here I have

194
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,879
said the same thing about Operation Iran that it was a bold

195
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,280
and brilliant move.  Donald Trump has been

196
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,520
praised a lot here.  And it has been said that

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,720
none of our troops or

198
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,479
civilians have been affected.

199
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
Ok so this is the thing.  After that, Iran's

200
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,680
Revolutionary Guard, which

201
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
comes under its supreme leader, has spoken.  Comini has also

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
hidden in a bunker and no one knows

203
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,919
in which bunker he is hiding.

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
They have cut off all communications regarding his location.

205
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,519
He is not talking to anyone.  So I am

206
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
saying that

207
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,560
Iran will not be able to achieve anything with this regrettable response.  But it

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,839
can cause huge damage.  He

209
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,640
may not be able to attack America but he will

210
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,399
attack American bases.  It

211
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,320
can attack the Gulf region and if the Gulf

212
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,519
region is attacked then the entire region will

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,480
become destabilized.  So you accept this

214
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,399
and let's see what happens next.

215
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
But let me tell you my analysis.   I

216
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,480
will tell you in a little while.  First let us

217
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,480
look at the updates.  As for the rest,

218
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,640
when the IDF was asked, Iran is saying

219
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
that it has shifted its entire nuclear

220
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
program somewhere else.

221
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,959
So the IDF, Israeli Defense

222
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Forces said that look, we don't

223
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,839
know yet.  It's too early to say.  We will

224
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,200
look into it and evaluate it.  Ok.

225
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,040
So this is the thing.  After that the Iranian Foreign

226
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
Minister said that now we will have to respond.

227
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
Abbas Saraksh We don't have any

228
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,760
other choice which is right.

229
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,480
Response to you I myself agree that

230
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,959
Iran cannot back down now.  Not you, I am

231
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,120
telling you how, I mean you should see, either

232
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,959
that country itself is very weak.

233
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,839
He doesn't have anything.  But if he has even one

234
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,720
missile, he will hit.  He will do anything

235
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,000
that will put America

236
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,760
in trouble.  Isn't it?  What if the entire

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,519
program has been shifted?  Now tomorrow I will

238
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,000

239
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,920
give you all the lectures on this topic one by one.  Turkey, you know,

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,839
Turkey has said that look, this

241
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,839
conflict can become wide open.  Turkey does

242
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
n't get along well with Iran.  But it is

243
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,760
not made from Turkey or Saudi Arabia at all.  At

244
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,839
least he can see it from Iran.  Ok?  So this

245
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
is the thing.  Chinese experts say that the

246
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,240
attack on the Iranian nuclear site is

247
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,800
not enough to destroy them.  Now

248
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,800
brother what will be the amount then?  Saudi Arabia

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,040
is on alert after this attack and Iran's

250
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,040
foreign minister will

251
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,120
meet Putin in Istanbul on June 22.  Ok?

252
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,920
So this is the thing.  Putin

253
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,560
is currently in Moscow.  So these two are going to

254
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,560
meet today.  PM Modi has spoken.

255
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,320
Russia has said that Trump has started a new

256
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,480
war without any reason.  This

257
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
is true.  And now no one knows what is going to happen in Iran.

258
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Because see, this was never a

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,800
direct attack on Iran.  Ok?  197 Till date

260
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
America has never attacked Iran in such a way

261
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,040
that you killed it directly.

262
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,519
So this happened during World War Two.

263
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,839
So that too happened briefly when Iran came to

264
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,079
America's side.  But this is absolutely

265
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,519
again the UK is evacuating its British nationals

266
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,360
from Israel because now you know

267
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,120
obviously the missiles are going to rain down and

268
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
it's going to start from tonight itself.

269
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,920
Everyone from Bahrain, Iran, Germany has said that

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,959
brother, please talk to us immediately.

271
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,279
You talk about America, Israel and Iran and that is it.   Is it

272
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,320
okay?  Pakistan has condemned America.

273
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:10,079
Iran says wow, this

274
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,240
is amazing.  He is saying right to defend.

275
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,760
Pakistan is talking to Iran.  Well, I did

276
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,200
n’t read this.  The right to defend itself.

277
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
Pakistan's Foreign Minister says,

278
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,839

279
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
brother, Asif Munir will be killed by hanging him upside down.  You will see, he will put it in front of the cannon.  He will blow

280
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,200
you away  He will launch you with the missile itself.

281
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,959
So the post says that

282
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,959
Pakistan has condemned the American attacks.   I

283
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,320

284
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,760
enjoyed the joke.  I want to give this pleasure to everyone.

285
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Which brand, I mean you should see and

286
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,640
ask them and Israel's airspace is being

287
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,640
said to be opened on Sunday itself, that

288
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,680
means today

289
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,440
then friends Lebanese and rest of the people from around the

290
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,360
world have come, basically the response but

291
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,079
now what will happen next, I think it will go on

292
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,880
like this for about a week, Iran will get tired,

293
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,480
America will not get tired, Iran will attack,

294
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,320
definitely it has told all its

295
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,920
ministers that we will not pack down,

296
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
where will it attack?  Can attack the Red Sea.

297
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,880
Iran's proxies may be active.

298
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,959
India is also in danger.  Friends, there is a

299
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,920
huge danger from this.  Proxies can appear here as well.

300
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,839
Pakistan has rightfully

301
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,079
come on Iran's red list.  The

302
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,399
one in Balochistan may be more unstable.

303
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,560
Energy prices may go up.  But

304
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,560
because America has jumped into the war,

305
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,519
America will attack with double force.  And

306
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,399
if that happens, Iran will not be able to survive.  I

307
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,360
think

308
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,839
Iran will come to the table in a week or two, or maybe even before that.

309
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,000
Because if Iran attacks and then America

310
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,720
attacks with more force then there will be devastation in Iran.  Do

311
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,920
you understand?  America, you are

312
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,519
not directly attacking America.   If

313
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,120
you are attacking on the basis then they will

314
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,760
make all of them good.  will turn against Iran.

315
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,160
Iran has such a difficult decision to make at this time.

316
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,680
But it is the same person, his

317
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,079
Foreign Minister, he does not have a choice.

318
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,720
They must be killed.  Very probably there

319
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,600
is zero 1% chance.  And if this happens then it will be a

320
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,040
miracle that Iran comes to the table.

321
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,959
But he will come.  It is the same, that they will come

322
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,560
but after getting beaten they will tell all the secrets

323
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,959
but unless you are beaten then the

324
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,120
police says that if you had told all this in advance then the same thing would have happened

325
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,959
with Iran, he will definitely come to the table,

326
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,959
now it is possible that Iran fires the

327
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,200
missile and says that okay we

328
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,120
fired the missile, we have taken the revenge because

329
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,959
America also says that okay you fired the missile, you have

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
satisfied your ego, you have given an

331
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
answer to the people, forgive the fight,

332
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
you shifted your nuclear program there,

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,519
we fired the missile, the game is

334
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
over we are done with the drama, now let's sit and

335
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,920
eat Vada Pav and have tea, now tell me

336
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,040
what do you want?  So ultimately there will be a

337
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,639
compromise because if I

338
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
told you the same thing that the visa will be changed, then it will happen

339
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,560
that if it continues for long and

340
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,120
people see the devastation, then people will

341
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,279
rise against their government.  Now the public has to respond, the

342
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,720
Supreme Leader of Iran has to

343
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,000
tell the people that we are strong.  Ok?

344
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,000
And now if you say too much that we

345
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,959
are powerful then the public will say, brother, we do

346
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,199
not have the power.  Let us live.  So Iran will play on this only.

347
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,120
These

348
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,920
things will continue like this for about a week and a half.  But I think

349
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,920
ultimately there will be peace talks.  There will be an agreement,

350
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,480
Iran will have to come to the table

351
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,880
