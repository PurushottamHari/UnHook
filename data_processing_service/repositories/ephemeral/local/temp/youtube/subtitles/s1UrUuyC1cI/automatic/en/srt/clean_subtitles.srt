I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss. Friends, today I will tell you that there is a very good article by India Today on whether Khomeini really lied to everyone?  Iran lied to everyone, this is a very important lecture.  In this, I will tell you each and every thing. Everything many things that you don't know you will get to know today.  And do you know what is the real reason behind Iran Israel war?  Barabanki.  The war has started from Barabanki.  Friends, if Barabanki was near Lucknow then this war would never have happened.  Because it was Rohalla Khomeini who brought the revolution in 1979.  His grandfather was from Barabanki.  Syed Ahmad Musafi Hindi He went to Iraq in 1830 and his grandson is Rohilla Khomeini.  So if he had not gone to Iraq, his family would still be living here today. He says very proudly that he is from our family.  So brother, you are seeing where India has its roots ? You can avail this wonderful course on Chanakya Niti and Personality Development. Friends, this is a combo for only ₹500.  So the link is given in the description comment box.  Let me make one thing clear to you today. Some kids say this in the comment box, some people say that Sir you are selling the course , you have come to sell the core.  My brother, today I will clarify one thing with you. What do you want?  You guys, I am not talking about everyone.  You guys love me very much. I am here because of you guys. But what do you guys want?  Ok? You will get this course for ₹1.5 to ₹2 Lakh each. Same thing, you would attend any seminar. Whatever it is that I teach. One session with a psychologist costs around ₹2 to ₹2000.  We have changed the lives of so many people. We don't have any funding in ₹200 and ₹300 friends.   There is no backing.  If someone gives you Rs 1 lakh for the same thing, you will take it smilingly saying that yes, it is a very good thing.  We have to survive.  We have a complete team.  Whatever knowledge we give you, it requires hard work. YouTube has revenue.  Ok. But it is not much that only we and you people are associated with such a big team.  So, first of all, we want this course to reach all over India and we want that every person who cannot afford such expensive things, should get access to them which only the elite people had and the second point is that there are expenses of a team and we have nothing in that too.  We don't have any funding.  We do not take funding.  We are walking all alone.  You guys have a problem with that too.  Well, I don't pay that much attention. But I said let me clear this thing. Ok?  And everyone is doing this. Every influencer is doing it.  So brother, we do it for your own good.  And so many people, so many children have benefited from so many of our courses, someone did one thing, someone did something else.  So we have courses worth ₹200 to ₹300, the amount you would spend on buying a pizza or watching a movie.  So friend, I hope I can understand at least this much that you will be sensible.  The rest of Iran had issued a fatwa.  See what this means now? See, Iran is a Shia nation and if we talk about Iran, then many great scientists have emerged from here. Parshiya has made amazing contributions to science. You won't believe it, it's Al, right? Al Algebra, right? Alchemy, learn from India, India never does marketing and it has always not done it.  This is in our nature.  We impart knowledge. We don't make a big deal about it.  He came here to learn.  All the Persians, because India used to be a centre of learning, they took all the knowledge from here and then gave it to Europe and the entire world.  Then Europe took that knowledge and today they are claiming it as their own. Well, the Persians who came here and learnt the knowledge from here did not have any bad intentions. He was a student and he also accepted that brother, yes, this knowledge has come from here.  Are you understanding? But by 1979 this has been going on for a very long time in the Western Powers.  But in 1979 things changed completely.  When fanaticism came, liberalism went away.  Even today there is a scientific culture in Iran.  Today, friends, if a referendum takes place in the cities of Iran, the city dwellers will 110% vote against the regime, but there is fanaticism in the villages because they are offering sheep and goats and they have nothing to do with education. He will do it against.  Ok?  This is true.  Now during this time, friends, a fatwa is issued by the Supreme Leader. Ayatollah Ali Khomeini says that we will never use nuclear weapons. You have to believe in Iran, sorry, Ali Khomenei, right now the Israel-Iran war is going on regarding nuclear weapons. But Iran has renounced it. A fatwa was issued.  Now its origin is in 2004, Hassan Rouhani, you know he was the 7th President of Iran from 2013 to 2021, then Ibrahim Raisi who died and after that Masood was appointed but the President has no work.  Let me tell you that Iran is a theological country i.e. a religious country.  Here, whoever is the President, no one has any control over who becomes the President.  He can intervene only in finance matters. Their main army is the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Council IRGC or Islamic Revolutionary Guard Council, it is answerable to the Supreme Leader.  In fact, even in the Presidential nomination, the Supreme Leader personally interviews you. Khomeini will personally interview you and you have to prove that yes brother, we have religion within us. Ok?  We are doing everything according to Islam. You will have to prove this. After that you can even contest elections for President. So a proper interview takes place and their president has the main IRGC.   The main army is deployed at the border. He has no work.  Their navy is not good.  Their air force and their army are just namesakes.  The main one is Iran's IRGC, which is under the Supreme Leader. So this President Hasan was also a Shia lawyer.  He was a lawyer.  Ok? Because there every decision is taken according to religion. So now he had introduced a fatwa at that time. Obviously it was Supreme Ali Khomeini who put this in perspective because look, what happened in 1989 was that Ruhillah Khomeini passed away. After that Theni, one of his top five students, and now see, there is a small council of 12 Ayatollahs, you get a place in it, now for that also there is a long process, like the election of President or religion like the Pope, how is the Pope elected, how is Khomeini elected, no one knows till now, right, so now the supreme leader had issued a fatwa, now what did he say, Ali Komeni says that brother, if we acquire nuclear bomb then it is wrong, this is wrong and this fatwa, it is more than NPT.  You know that Iran signed the NPT.  Isn't it?  And what does the NPT do now?  Let me also tell you about NPT.  Nuclear Prohibition Treaty came in 1969.  Today we will discuss it in great detail. Came in 1969.  Why did you come?  Because the Permanent Five here started fearing that the nuclear rage is increasing. As soon as China gets nuclear weapons, the entire world will have access to them.  So we have to create such a framework that there are no nuclear weapons anymore.  Now see, nuclear energy is the cleanest form of energy.  India produces electricity from coal. France produces 90% of its total energy from nuclear power. So the day you got nuclear weapons, the day you got nuclear energy, you were transformed.  But there is a difference between the nuclear energy that you use for electricity and a nuclear bomb.  Ok ?  Now what happens in this?  The problem with Iran is the enrichment that happens in it. What does enrichment mean?  U238.  U238 is a uranium isotope.  This is impure. U235 is made from this which is pure. So what happens now is that there are very large centrifuges like this.  Uranium is condensed.  I mean, like it happens, the churner is churned in a way, it keeps rotating, they are very big, as big as a building, so U35 comes out from it, if you suppose 10 to 15% uranium gets intruded, then you can now use this energy, if it gets intruded up to 30%, then you can generate electricity from it, and if it gets intruded up to 60%, then you can make an atom bomb from it.  So what does the NPT do?  NPT said in 1969 that whoever signs it, we will give nuclear technology to everyone.  If you need nuclear material, we will give it to you too.  You come and assign it.  In return you will have to assure us that you will never become a nuclear bomb.  You will never make a nuclear bomb.  Then after that you will have to assure us that we will comply with the IAEA International Atomic Energy Association whose headquarter is in Vienna which is the capital of Austria.  All of us will come to your place and look at your nuclear programme and if we find anything wrong we will make a report.  Is it okay?  And action will be taken against you accordingly.  So even Iran and North Korea had signed it.  Is it okay?  All this has happened.  Now friends, what happened is that all this happened but in 1979 there was a revolution in Iran.  Now even after that he did not come out of NPT. But America is what it is, right? America, let me tell you that there was a time when Iran-Iraq war went on from 1980 to 1988. So Iran had asked America for help by saying that they should provide spare parts for the weapons that were left behind.  Ok?  Now when this help was asked for, then America did this work and at that time Israel also helped, so this went on for a long time, quite a long time but slowly and surreptitiously, it is said that they kept doing nuclear enrichment because under NPT, NPT had given them the material, after that Pakistan had done complete black marketing saying come brother, whoever wants to make nuclear bomb come to us, so at that time it sold its blueprint to Iraq, Libya and Iran, it sold it to North Korea, right, all these things happened, then after that America entered Iraq.  Israel and Iraq destroyed the reactor.  If a nuclear bomb is found anywhere then Israel will act. And it was the same for Pakistan too. Israel would have attacked Pakistan also but India had refused. Now Iran was left empty.  Everywhere else, they destroyed Libya, destroyed Iraq. Only Iran was left.  And that was it, look brother, we do not have control over Iran. And if he makes a nuclear bomb, it will become a huge problem.  So the negotiations started after 2000 and it was then that this fatwa was issued that brother said in the BBC interview that look, we will never acquire nuclear weapons. This was the official statement of Iran. He had issued this fatwa.  But at that time the experts here said that this is a diplomacy.  The fatwa is just for the sake of name.  This is just for the name. Because they tell us that this is haram.  This is forbidden in Islam.  So we will never make these types of weapons and you will find these statements in Khamenei's paragraph of 2010, but it is clearly mentioned that it only forbids not production and storage. It says, look here, there is a grey line that we will not use it, just destroy it, but we will produce it, we will also store it, so this thing is there in the fatwa that it is forbidden but we can do the production. So experts say that it is not a religious order but a political statement.  I mean, let me tell you what its political statement is, that when the wind blows according to our wishes, then we will work according to our wishes.  For example, like when the JCPOA got stuck. Ok.  I'll turn it on again.  So JCPOA, this was the second slide actually.  So when the JCPOA was implemented, what was in the JCPOA was that America had made an agreement with Iran and when America had made an agreement with Iran, America had said that listen, you will not make a nuclear bomb.  Then America and Iran used to say that we will not make nuclear bomb at all and then this rhetoric became very popular that we do not have to make nuclear bomb.  We are working for peaceful energy. But as soon as Israel attacked, Iran changed its stance and did not say anything about the nuclear bomb.  So this is political diplomacy or political statement that as long as things are going in our favor, we will say that we will not make a nuclear bomb.  But if you go against us then we will change our statement.  So basically this is what is being talked about here.  Do you understand? And this very Khomeini has said these things. But friends, now things have reached a very bad state. Because if we talk about Iran, then we are seeing the climax of Iran-Israel war here.  Now friends, this fatwa, as we told you, at that time, Hasan Ruhani was who he was.  Ok?  That we are not going to do all these things and we will basically act according to America. This was his statement in the fatwa that was issued but at that time America was also helping Iran. IAE things have calmed down a bit.   The period from 2000 to 2010 was a bit unstable and stable. You will not see such a true problem anywhere in the world. Ok?  But things changed after 2015.  Is it okay? Things started changing after 2015.  Now there are 85 public statements here.  Ok?  Only three of them use the word Haram Haram.   This is what is called harem.  So in a way this is a religious fatwa as well as a rational fatwa and we do not need nuclear weapons. Neither today nor tomorrow nor ever.  This was said. Mehndi Khilji says that look, the fatwa can change and now because this will be told to Khomeini that Sir, you had said that nuclear weapons will never be used, we had not talked about storage and production and the fatwa can never be changed, now look, let us talk about tobacco, tobacco 18 means from 1800 to 1900, historically, tobacco OPM is produced in large quantities in Iran, its land is such, so a lot of tobacco was found here and at one time, tobacco was their only source of livelihood.  The British came and took it away from them.  Ok?  The British came and took it away.  So all this happened at that time in 1890. So the tobacco ban was revoked.  The tobacco ban was revoked. Because the British had come.  The Western powers had arrived.  When their purpose was accomplished. So the analysts argue that whatever the fatwa is, they should follow the same path.  Is it okay ?  This is a diplomatic valve.  That means whenever we feel the need, we will issue a fatwa accordingly. Now let's assume that America and Iran sit at one table and make a deal. Ok?  And if both become good friends then perhaps a fatwa may be issued that we will never touch nuclear weapons.  This is a possibility.  So that's why there is a diplomatic way to do things.  Now even President Obama had said this.  At that time I had said that brother, we have great respect for the fatwa.  Extremely welcoming.  And let's assume that Iran is in the present times and if you make Donald Trump or even Obama sit there, they will all say that no, no, we do not accept this.  Butt said this at that time because at that time Iran was acting according to America.   In Javed Zarif's memorandum, he said that this was a strategic tool to remove Western fears. Now look at this JCPO, I have explained it to them many times in a little ease.  You can pause comfortably and look at this. From 2015 to 2020, ultimately Donald Trump came and said that brother, we will stay away from this.  Is it okay?  Now after 2018, I told you that things have completely changed. Killed Qasim Soleimani and attacked anywhere. Israel became very happy that it was good that America had backed off.  Ok? So the same thing and now the supreme leaders are not talking about this.  Ok ?  And in 204-25, friends, the entire Mebodi, the cleric religious guru here, said that look, understand that Muslims should get weapons.  If someone threatens them then it becomes very important and we will have to make a bomb like North Korea.  The Nuclear Chief says that understand that after the Israeli attack we made a doctrinal shift and there is nothing wrong in it, friends.  Like India should also stop going on first no first use basis. Turn this off.  You should go for first use so that Pakistan can be economically drained. Its nuclear weapons should always be in a state of readiness so that its money can be saved.  It's enough. We too have endured a lot.  There is nothing wrong in this. If Iran is doing this then Israel has attacked and if Iran does not follow its doctrine then Iran can be destroyed.  Are you understanding?  So this is the thing.  But these things that are said, fatwa and all this means that it will be a line written in stone.  Nothing like this happens.  Politics changes. Things are done to make people happy.  The poor people are just very innocent. Get stuck in it.  But when you hit it's okay.  And if we hit him then it is murder. it is.  Everything is going on like this. So this is it.  Recently IAEA has also written a report that they have enriched it up to 60%. But it is good for making bombs.  Now the IAEA is saying that we did not tell them that they have a bomb.  But friends, if this statement has come then is it a bomb ?  Iran will make it.  He will make it now too. Israel is saying that it will make these 15 bombs in a month or two.  Israel has not yet revealed its nuclear program, that is, it has not yet revealed its bomb.  However, it is said that he has 60 to 70 nuclear bombs.  But till date he has never disclosed that we have so many bombs.  Do you understand?  So that's all it is.  Rest, as we told you, natural uranium contains 0.7% U235 in U238. 5% U235 i.e. Lower Enriched Uranium.   Is it okay?  That means it is not completely pure. So it is fine for commercial nuclear power plants. High Enriched 20% You can now build Research Reactors.  Great and cool.   If it is 90% or above 60% then it will be amazing. Then you can make anything, make a bomb , make a nuclear reactor, the work will be done. So here it is, what do you think?  You must tell me in the comment box.  Rest you can take the course with us.  You will benefit a lot.  Stay happy keep reading heartily siddhant agnihotri signing off.
