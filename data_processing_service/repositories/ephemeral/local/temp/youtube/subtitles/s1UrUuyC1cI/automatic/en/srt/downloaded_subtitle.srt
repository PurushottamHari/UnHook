1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,319
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,680
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,240
Welcome to Study Gloss.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,639
Friends, today I will tell you that there is a very

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,880
good article by India Today on whether

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,119
Khomeini really lied to everyone?  Iran

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,400
lied to everyone, this is a very important

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
lecture.  In this, I will tell you each and every thing.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,320
Everything many things that

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,240
you don't know you will get to know today.  And

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,039
do you know

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,800
what is the real reason behind Iran Israel war?  Barabanki.  The

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,200
war has started from Barabanki.  Friends, if Barabanki was

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,280
near Lucknow then this war would never have

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
happened.  Because it was Rohalla Khomeini

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,559
who

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,680
brought the revolution in 1979.  His grandfather was

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,120
from Barabanki.  Syed Ahmad Musafi Hindi

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,680
He went to Iraq in 1830 and his grandson is

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,239
Rohilla Khomeini.  So if he had not

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,640
gone to Iraq, his family would still be living here today.

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239
He says very proudly that he is

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
from our family.  So brother, you are seeing

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,320
where India has its roots

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
?

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,560
You can avail this wonderful course on Chanakya Niti and Personality Development.

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Friends, this is a combo for only ₹500.  So the

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,760
link is given in the description comment box.  Let

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
me make one thing clear to you today.

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,720
Some kids say this in the comment box,

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,000
some people say that Sir you are selling the course

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,360
, you have come to sell the core.  My brother,

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
today I will clarify one thing with you.

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,479
What do you want?  You guys, I am

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
not talking about everyone.  You guys love me very much.

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,119
I am here because of you guys.

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,360
But what do you guys want?  Ok?

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,759
You will get this course for ₹1.5 to ₹2 Lakh each.

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,439
Same thing, you would attend any seminar.

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,439
Whatever it is that I teach.

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,680
One session with a psychologist costs around ₹2 to

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,479
₹2000.  We have changed the lives of so many people.

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,720
We don't have any funding in ₹200 and ₹300 friends.   There

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,479
is no backing.  If someone

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,880
gives you Rs 1 lakh for the same thing, you will take it smilingly saying that

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,280
yes, it is a very good thing.  We

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,119
have to survive.  We have a complete team.  Whatever

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
knowledge we give you, it requires hard work.

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,880
YouTube has revenue.  Ok.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
But it is not much that only

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,319
we and you people are

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,479
associated with such a big team.  So, first of all,

55
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,280
we want this course to reach all over India

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,120
and we want that every person who

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,680
cannot afford such expensive

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,080
things, should get access to them which only the elite

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,160
people had and the second

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
point is that there are expenses of a team and

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,760
we have nothing in that too.  We don't have any

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,080
funding.  We do not take funding.  We are

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,920
walking all alone.  You

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,360
guys have a problem with that too.  Well, I don't pay that much attention.

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
But I said let me clear this thing.

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,200
Ok?  And everyone is doing this.

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
Every influencer is doing it.  So

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,000
brother, we do it for your own good.  And so

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,160
many people, so many children have

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,160
benefited from so many of our

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,000
courses, someone did one thing,

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,599
someone did something else.  So we have courses worth ₹200 to ₹300, the

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
amount you would spend on buying a pizza or watching a movie.  So

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,720

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,160
friend, I hope I can understand at least this much that

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,159
you will be sensible.  The rest of Iran had

77
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:07,239
issued a fatwa.  See what this means now?

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,239
See, Iran is a Shia nation and

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
if we talk about Iran, then

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,319
many great scientists have emerged from here.

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
Parshiya has made amazing contributions to science.

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,519
You won't believe it, it's Al, right?

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,440
Al Algebra, right? Alchemy, learn from India,

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,440
India never does marketing

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,360
and it has always not done it.  This

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,599
is in our nature.  We impart knowledge.

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,080
We don't make a big deal about it.  He

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,319
came here to learn.  All the Persians, because

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,319
India used to be a centre of learning, they

90
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,840
took all the knowledge from here and then

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,319
gave it to Europe and the entire world.  Then

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,080
Europe took that knowledge and today they are claiming it as their own.

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,720
Well, the Persians who came here and

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,239
learnt the knowledge from here did not have any bad intentions.

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
He was a student and he

96
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,040
also accepted that brother, yes, this knowledge has

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,680
come from here.  Are you understanding?

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,760
But by 1979 this has been going on for a very long time

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
in the Western Powers.  But in 1979 things

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,480
changed completely.  When fanaticism came,

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,959
liberalism went away.  Even today there

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,959
is a scientific culture in Iran.  Today, friends, if a

103
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,920
referendum takes place in the cities of Iran, the

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,920
city dwellers will 110% vote against the regime,

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
but there is fanaticism in the villages

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
because they are offering sheep and

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,320
goats and they have nothing to do with education.

108
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,519
He

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,359
will do it against.  Ok?  This is true.  Now

110
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,520
during this time, friends, a fatwa is issued

111
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,600
by the Supreme Leader.

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,280
Ayatollah Ali Khomeini says that

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,199
we will never use nuclear weapons.

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,080
You have to believe in Iran, sorry,

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,720
Ali Khomenei, right now the

116
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,240
Israel-Iran war is going on regarding nuclear weapons.

117
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,840
But Iran has renounced it.

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,479
A fatwa was issued.  Now

119
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,040
its origin is in 2004, Hassan Rouhani, you

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,160
know he was the 7th President of

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,240
Iran from 2013 to 2021, then Ibrahim Raisi

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
who died and after that Masood was

123
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
appointed but the President has no work.  Let me

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,919
tell you that Iran is a

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,840
theological country i.e. a religious country.  Here,

126
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,199
whoever is the President, no

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,680
one has any control over who becomes the President.  He

128
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,440
can intervene only in finance matters.

129
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,320
Their main army is the Iranian

130
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,720
Revolutionary Guard Council IRGC or

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,520
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Council, it is

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,520
answerable to the Supreme Leader.  In fact, even in the

133
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Presidential nomination, the

134
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,440
Supreme Leader personally interviews you.

135
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,919
Khomeini will personally

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,639
interview you and you have to prove that

137
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,880
yes brother, we have religion within us.

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,800
Ok?  We are doing everything according to Islam.

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
You will have to prove this.

140
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,000
After that you can even contest elections for President.

141
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,800
So a proper interview takes place and

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,759
their president has the main IRGC.   The

143
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,520
main army is deployed at the border.

144
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,600
He has no work.  Their

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,240
navy is not good.  Their air force and

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
their army are just namesakes.  The main one is

147
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,960
Iran's IRGC, which is under the Supreme Leader.

148
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,960
So this President Hasan was

149
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,639
also a Shia lawyer.  He was a lawyer.  Ok?

150
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,440
Because there every decision is taken according to religion.

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,960
So now he had introduced a fatwa at that time.

152
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,960
Obviously

153
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,000
it was Supreme Ali Khomeini who put this in perspective

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,919
because look, what happened in 1989 was that

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
Ruhillah Khomeini passed away.

156
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,880
After that Theni, one of his top five students,

157
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,440
and now see, there is a small council of

158
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,360
12 Ayatollahs,

159
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
you get a place in it, now for that also there is a

160
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
long process, like the election of President

161
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,240
or religion like the Pope,

162
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
how is the Pope elected, how is Khomeini elected, no

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
one knows till now, right, so

164
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,319
now the supreme leader had

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,639
issued a fatwa, now what did he

166
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,319
say, Ali Komeni says that brother,

167
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:52,080
if we acquire nuclear bomb then

168
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,199
it is wrong, this is wrong and this fatwa, it is

169
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,759
more than NPT.  You know that

170
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,840
Iran signed the NPT.  Isn't it?  And

171
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
what does the NPT do now?  Let

172
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,319
me also tell you about NPT.  Nuclear

173
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,520
Prohibition Treaty came in 1969.  Today

174
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,400
we will discuss it in great detail.

175
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,720
Came in 1969.  Why did you come?  Because the

176
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,919
Permanent Five here started fearing that the

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
nuclear rage is increasing.

178
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,520
As soon as China gets nuclear weapons, the

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,800
entire world will have access to them.  So we have to

180
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,000
create such a framework that there are

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,599
no nuclear weapons anymore.  Now see,

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,039
nuclear energy is the cleanest form

183
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,759
of energy.  India produces electricity from coal.

184
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,840
France produces 90% of its total energy from nuclear power.

185
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,840
So the day you got

186
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,680
nuclear weapons, the day you got

187
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,800
nuclear energy, you were

188
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,800
transformed.  But there is a difference between the nuclear

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
energy that you use for electricity

190
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,199
and a nuclear bomb.  Ok

191
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,400
?  Now what happens in this?  The

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,720
problem with Iran is the enrichment that happens in it.

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,160
What does enrichment mean?  U238.  U238 is a

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,120

195
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,599
uranium isotope.  This is impure.

196
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,000
U235 is made from this which is pure.

197
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,400
So what happens now is that there are very large

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
centrifuges like this.  Uranium is condensed.  I

199
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,319
mean, like it happens, the churner is

200
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
churned in a way, it keeps

201
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,440
rotating, they are very big, as

202
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,000
big as a building, so

203
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,639
U35 comes out from it, if you

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,240
suppose 10 to 15% uranium gets intruded,

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,960
then you can now use this energy, if it gets intruded up to

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,599
30%, then you can generate electricity from

207
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,319
it, and if it gets intruded up to 60%, then you

208
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,759
can make an atom bomb from it.  So what does the NPT

209
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,560
do?  NPT said in 1969 that

210
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,599
whoever signs it, we will

211
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,320
give nuclear technology to everyone.  If

212
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,200
you need nuclear material, we will give it to you too.  You come and

213
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
assign it.  In return you will

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,440
have to assure us that you will never

215
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,360
become a nuclear bomb.  You will never

216
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,279
make a nuclear bomb.  Then after that you will

217
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,680
have to assure us that we will comply with the IAEA

218
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,040
International Atomic Energy Association whose

219
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,000
headquarter is in Vienna which is the

220
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,680
capital of Austria.  All of us will

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,080
come to your place and look at your nuclear programme

222
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,240
and if we find anything wrong

223
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,640
we will make a report.  Is it okay?  And

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,640
action will be taken against you accordingly.  So

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,160
even Iran and North Korea had signed it.  Is it

226
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,760
okay?  All this has happened.  Now

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,640
friends, what happened is that all this happened but

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,480
in 1979 there was a revolution in Iran.  Now

229
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,839
even after that he did not come out of NPT.

230
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,080
But America is what it is, right?

231
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,200
America, let me tell you that there was a time when

232
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,600
Iran-Iraq war went on from 1980 to 1988.

233
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
So Iran had

234
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,920
asked America for help by saying that they should

235
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,920
provide spare parts for the weapons that were left behind.  Ok?  Now when

236
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
this help was asked for, then America did

237
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,800
this work and at that time Israel also

238
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,360
helped, so this went on for a long time, quite a long time but

239
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,440
slowly and surreptitiously, it is said that they kept doing

240
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,519
nuclear enrichment because

241
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,519
under NPT, NPT had given them the material,

242
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,600
after that Pakistan had done complete black

243
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,279
marketing saying come brother,

244
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,800
whoever wants to make nuclear bomb come to us,

245
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,040
so at that time it sold its blueprint to Iraq, Libya and Iran, it

246
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,839

247
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,839
sold it to North Korea, right, all these

248
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,519
things happened, then after that America

249
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,600
entered Iraq.  Israel and Iraq

250
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
destroyed the reactor.  If a

251
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,519
nuclear bomb is found anywhere then Israel will act.

252
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,680
And it was the same for Pakistan too.

253
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
Israel would have attacked Pakistan also

254
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,640
but India had refused.

255
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,640
Now Iran was left empty.  Everywhere else, they

256
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,880
destroyed Libya, destroyed Iraq.

257
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Only Iran was left.  And that was it,

258
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,320
look brother, we do not have control over Iran.

259
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,160
And if he makes a nuclear bomb, it will become a

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,640
huge problem.  So the

261
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,200
negotiations started after 2000 and it was then that this

262
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,720
fatwa was issued that brother

263
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,640
said in the BBC interview that look, we will

264
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,120
never acquire nuclear weapons.

265
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,200
This was the official statement of Iran.

266
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,760
He had issued this fatwa.  But at

267
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,480
that time the experts here said

268
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,600
that this is a diplomacy.  The fatwa is just for the sake

269
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,760
of name.  This is just for the name.

270
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,480
Because they tell us that this is haram.  This

271
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,720
is forbidden in Islam.  So we will never make these

272
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,680
types of weapons

273
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,800
and you will find these statements in Khamenei's paragraph of 2010, but it is

274
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,480

275
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,640
clearly mentioned that

276
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,839
it only forbids not production and

277
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,880
storage. It says, look here, there is a

278
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,160
grey line that we will not use it, just

279
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,000
destroy it, but we will produce it, we will

280
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,160
also store it, so this thing is there in the fatwa that it is

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
forbidden but we can do the production.

282
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,279
So experts say that it is

283
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,200
not a religious order but a political

284
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,160
statement.  I mean, let me tell you what

285
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,360
its political statement is, that

286
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,200
when the wind blows according to our wishes, then we will

287
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,399
work according to our wishes.  For example,

288
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,240
like when the JCPOA got stuck.

289
00:11:52,399 --> 00:12:01,600
Ok.  I'll turn it

290
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,399
on again.  So JCPOA, this

291
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,720
was the second slide actually.  So when the JCPOA was

292
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,680
implemented, what was in the JCPOA was

293
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,040
that America had made an agreement

294
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,200
with Iran and when

295
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,120
America had made an agreement with Iran, America had

296
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,399
said that listen, you will

297
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,839
not make a nuclear bomb.  Then America and Iran used to say

298
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
that we will not make nuclear bomb at all

299
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,680
and then this rhetoric became very popular that

300
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
we do not have to make nuclear bomb.  We are

301
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,839
working for peaceful energy.

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,920
But as soon as Israel attacked, Iran

303
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,680
changed its stance and did not say anything

304
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,200
about the nuclear bomb.  So this is

305
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,600
political diplomacy or political

306
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,040
statement that as long as things are going in our favor,

307
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
we will say that we will

308
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,800
not make a nuclear bomb.  But if you

309
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,959
go against us then we will

310
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,880
change our statement.  So basically this is what is being

311
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,480
talked about here.  Do you understand?

312
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,880
And this very Khomeini has said these things.

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,040
But friends, now things have

314
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,760
reached a very bad state.

315
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,480
Because if we talk about Iran,

316
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,639
then we are seeing the climax of Iran-Israel war

317
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,880
here.  Now friends,

318
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,680
this fatwa, as we told you, at that time, Hasan

319
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,040
Ruhani was who he was.  Ok?  That we are

320
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,800
not going to do all these things and we will basically

321
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,800
act according to America.

322
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,480
This was his statement in the fatwa that was issued but at that time

323
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,519
America was also helping Iran.

324
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,000
IAE things have calmed down a bit.   The

325
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,160
period from 2000 to 2010 was

326
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,680
a bit unstable and stable.

327
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,120
You will not see such a true problem anywhere in the world.

328
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,480
Ok?  But

329
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,760
things changed after 2015.  Is it okay?

330
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,320
Things started changing after 2015.  Now there are 85 public

331
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,880
statements here.  Ok?  Only three of them

332
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,480
use the word Haram Haram.   This is what is

333
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,040
called harem.  So in a way this is a

334
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
religious fatwa as well as a rational fatwa

335
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,680
and we do not need nuclear weapons.

336
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,560
Neither today nor tomorrow nor ever.  This was said.

337
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,399
Mehndi Khilji says that look, the fatwa

338
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,320
can change and now because

339
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,639
this will be told to Khomeini that Sir, you had

340
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,040
said that nuclear weapons will never be

341
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,360
used, we had not talked about storage and

342
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,000
production and the fatwa can never be changed,

343
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,240
now look, let us talk about tobacco,

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,279
tobacco 18 means from 1800 to 1900,

345
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,880
historically, tobacco OPM is

346
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,079
produced in large quantities in Iran, its land is

347
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,440
such, so a lot of tobacco was found here and at

348
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,320
one time, tobacco was their only

349
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,040
source of livelihood.  The British came and took it

350
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,079
away from them.  Ok?  The British came and took it

351
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,399
away.  So all this happened at that time in 1890.

352
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,040
So the tobacco ban was revoked.  The

353
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,720
tobacco ban was revoked.

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Because the British had come.  The Western powers had

355
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
arrived.  When their purpose was accomplished.

356
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
So the analysts argue that

357
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,079
whatever the fatwa is, they should follow the same path.  Is it okay

358
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,920
?  This is a diplomatic valve.  That means

359
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,760
whenever we feel the need, we will issue a fatwa accordingly.

360
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,760
Now let's assume that

361
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,440
America and Iran sit at one table and make a deal.

362
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,959
Ok?  And if both become good friends

363
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,399
then perhaps a fatwa may be

364
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,240
issued that we will never

365
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,720
touch nuclear weapons.  This is a

366
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,279
possibility.  So that's why there is a diplomatic

367
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
way to do things.  Now

368
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,959
even President Obama had said this.  At that time I had said

369
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,519
that brother, we have great respect

370
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,160
for the fatwa.  Extremely welcoming.  And let's

371
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,160
assume that Iran is in the present times and

372
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,760
if you make Donald Trump or even Obama sit there,

373
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,360
they will all say that no, no, we do not

374
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,920
accept this.  Butt said this at that time because at that

375
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,839
time Iran was acting according to America.   In

376
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,040
Javed Zarif's memorandum, he said that

377
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,360
this was a strategic tool to

378
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,199
remove Western fears.

379
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,760
Now look at this

380
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,920
JCPO, I have explained it to them many times in a little ease.  You can

381
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,160
pause comfortably and look at this.

382
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
From 2015 to 2020, ultimately Donald Trump

383
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,240
came and said that brother, we will stay away from

384
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,480
this.  Is it okay?  Now after 2018, I

385
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,199
told you that things have completely changed.

386
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,360
Killed Qasim Soleimani and attacked anywhere.

387
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,360
Israel became very happy that it was good that

388
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
America had backed off.  Ok?

389
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,839
So the same thing and now the supreme

390
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,880
leaders are not talking about this.  Ok

391
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,519
?  And in 204-25, friends, the entire

392
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,920
Mebodi, the cleric religious guru here,

393
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,480
said that look, understand that

394
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,720
Muslims should get weapons.  If

395
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,199
someone threatens them then it becomes very

396
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,600
important and we will have to make a bomb like North Korea.  The

397
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,320
Nuclear Chief says that

398
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,800
understand that after the Israeli attack we made

399
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
a doctrinal shift and there is nothing wrong in it,

400
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,759
friends.  Like India should also

401
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,160
stop going on first no first use basis.

402
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,160
Turn this off.  You should go for first use

403
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,480
so that Pakistan can be economically drained.

404
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
Its nuclear weapons should always be in a state of readiness

405
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,040
so that its money can be saved.  It's enough.

406
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,120
We too have endured a lot.  There is nothing wrong in this.

407
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
If Iran is doing this then Israel has

408
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,560
attacked and if Iran does

409
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,440
not follow its doctrine then Iran can be destroyed.  Are

410
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,759
you understanding?  So this is the thing.  But

411
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,639
these things that are said, fatwa and

412
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,040
all this means that it will be a line written in stone.  Nothing like this

413
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,959
happens.  Politics changes.

414
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,519
Things are done to make people happy.  The

415
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,319
poor people are just very innocent.

416
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,480
Get stuck in it.  But when you hit it's

417
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,160
okay.  And if we hit him then it is murder.

418
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,799
it is.  Everything is going on like this.

419
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,000
So this

420
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,880
is it.  Recently IAEA has also written a report that

421
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,799
they have enriched it up to 60%.

422
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,880
But it is good for making bombs.  Now the

423
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,039
IAEA is saying that we did not

424
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,360
tell them that they have a bomb.  But friends,

425
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,080
if this statement has come then is it a bomb

426
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
?  Iran will make it.  He will make it now too.

427
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,240
Israel is saying that it will

428
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,000
make these 15 bombs in a month or two.  Israel has not yet revealed

429
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,000
its nuclear program, that is, it has

430
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,919
not yet revealed its bomb.  However, it is

431
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,640

432
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,000
said that he has 60 to 70 nuclear bombs.  But till date he has never

433
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,200
disclosed that we have so many

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
bombs.  Do you understand?  So that's all it

435
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,400
is.  Rest, as we told you, natural

436
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,840
uranium contains 0.7% U235 in U238.

437
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,919
5% U235 i.e. Lower Enriched Uranium.   Is it

438
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,520
okay?  That means it is not completely pure.

439
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,480
So it is fine for commercial nuclear power plants.

440
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,280
High Enriched 20% You

441
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,160
can now build Research Reactors.  Great and cool.   If it is

442
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,240
90% or above 60% then it will be amazing.

443
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,000
Then you can make anything, make a bomb

444
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,799
, make a nuclear reactor, the work will be done.

445
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,480
So here it is, what do you think?  You

446
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,919
must tell me in the comment box.  Rest

447
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
you can take the course with us.  You will

448
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,039
