Hello Friends.  Friends, recently a map was released by Israel to garner support in the world in the midst of the Israel-Iran war.  Meaning, here we can show the world that Iran is not just a threat to Israel.   There is a danger to the whole world.  But he made a big mistake inside this map.  And seeing this he had to apologise. Because if you look at social media in India, a huge backlash was seen. You can see this news Israel Iran tension IDF, basically this is Israel Defense Forces. They apologize to Indians over wrong map.  So let us understand this in a little detail, what exactly has happened here?  You will get to know a lot.  Look, first of all you should look at its background here.  You all know that a big war is going on between Israel and Iran.  And in view of this, the Israeli Defense Forces released an infographic map in which they tried to show how far Iran's missiles can reach. If you see this, here this tweet has been made by the Israeli Defense Forces in which they have said that Iran is a global threat.  So basically Israel is telling the whole world that this is not just a threat to us.  Israel is not the end goal. It is only the beginning.  If we are attacked, it will be just the beginning.  We had no other choice but to act.  And because of this we were left with no option. And that is why we started Operation Rising Lion here.  And the intent of these Israel Defense Forces was to warn the international community that look at how Iran can today fire its missiles as far as Europe. So in fact if I tell you what is shown inside the map? Inside the map, an attempt has been made to show basically a radial range map that if Iran launches its ballistic missiles, then how far it can reach and here the different ranges are shown in circles 300 500 800 1300 2000 Km.  Iran currently has a range of more than that. If you look at this, here are the different missiles of Iran, for example 300 km. You will get to see Fateh 110, a short range system with a range of . Apart from this there is 500 Km.  It became a Zulfiqar class missile. 800 Km  1300 Km  Here you will see Shahab three missiles. And the most important thing is 2000 km. If you look at the range of , then this missile can actually reach India also.  And if you look here, it is Gadr 110.  Sejil is done.  So there are many such new variants which can fire missiles even at Iran and India.  So if we talk about its range, then the entire Middle East is covered. These missiles can reach all the Gulf states, Iraq, Israel, Syria, Turkey, Afghanistan in South Asia, Pakistan and even India. And in fact, within Europe, their missiles can reach Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. And some parts of Africa became Libya, became Sudan.  You can see almost the entire thing is being covered. Ethiopia is getting covered.  Meaning, an attempt was made by Israel to show a radial range that these missiles can be lethal for the entire world.  So a strategic messaging was being given here.  In a way, you can understand that Israel, by showing the missile range, was telling the world that Iran is not just our problem.  It's yours too.  Apart from this, he was also trying to garner public support here.  Was trying to garner diplomatic support.  Across Europe and Asia.  And along with this you can see that it is also being said that the Israeli Defense Forces have carried out dozens of air strike carriers on Iran. You must have seen that since yesterday there has been continuous news that their nuclear sites in Iran have been attacked in some way. So the purpose behind it , the rationale behind it was that Israel was in a way showing it to the world. And along with this a psychological pressure was also put on Iran that if we show Iran in a negative sense, then in a way Iran will be a little constrained that it will not develop missiles etc. the way it is doing now. So now the question arises, what happened? What's the problem with this?  What's Wrong in the Map?  Now his intention here was to send a message to the international responses and alliances. But what did he do by mistake here ?  The map of Jammu and Kashmir including Ladakh basically shows a part of Pakistan.  As you all know, this is a very sensitive issue in India.  Whenever such things happen then backlash is seen here. If you look carefully, this is a zoomed-in map, you can see clearly inside the map that an attempt has been made to show this part of Pakistan in this manner.  In fact, an attempt was made to show almost the entire Jammu and Kashmir in the map of Pakistan, including the Aksai symbol.  So because of this, if you look at the immediate reactions here, the Indians on social media immediately pointed out this error and said that the territorial sovereignty of India is undermine.  There are many Indians who support Israel diplomatically and ideologically.  There is a lot of support for Israel in India. So he also said here in a way that it is very disappointing that Israel is not taking care of all these things. Some users here also called it insensitive.  It was said that it was unacceptable, that in a way, how could Israel, which is a close ally of India, make such a mistake. Many believed that this could be an innocent mistake.  An attempt may also be being made to give a diplomatic message. So you will get to see different opinions here. But it was certain that the people who were constantly on social media were very angry.  In fact you can see there is a tweet here now you understand why India remains neutral.  This question arises many times, like for example, when India carried out Operation Sindoor, a call immediately came from Israel and they said that we fully support you.  But you never get to see the same thing from the Indian side.  It is often seen that India remains neutral in these things. Because India's relations with Muslim majority countries are also quite good at present. So because of this some users are now saying that look this is the biggest reason due to which India often remains neutral.  No one is really your friend in diplomacy.  It is not necessary that at what moment a person will be your friend and at what moment he will become your enemy. So this kind of ideology was visible on social media.  But it is obvious that Israel also knew that this was not right and they immediately apologized and asked for forgiveness. If you see here, you can see that Israel also knew that this was not right and they immediately apologized and asked for forgiveness.  If you can see here, Israel was in a way saying that the map shown was not the correct illustration.  In fact, I was seeing on every tweet that the Indians who had posted the message here had replied regarding that map, for example the map posted by Israel Defense Forces incorrectly shows Jammu and Kashmir as part of Pakistan.  So if you look below every message, you will see that the Israel Defense Forces have tweeted and replied that this post is an illustration of the region.  This map fails to precisely determine the border.  He is not deciphering it correctly.  We apologize for any offence caused by this image.  So if any offence has been committed here or any kind of mistake has been made, we apologize for it.  In fact here again you can see Use Correct Map of India and regarding this also the same message has been given by the Israeli Defense Forces.  Now see why all these things matter?   The most important is the relationship between India and Israel. If you look at the relations between India and Israel, you will find that everything is very strong, be it diplomatically, defence or technology, and both countries often support each other on international forums. But this kind of blunder, even if it is unintentional, the public sentiments here can suddenly flare up at any time and somewhere or the other, especially at this time, you all know that global alliances are being tested to see which country is with which country; a lot of discussions have started taking place these days in geopolitics and especially the issue of Kashmir, you all know that how core an issue it is for India and this is not just about Israel, if you see, at many places, be it Google Maps or United Nations or in many foreign tax text books, when the correct map of India is not shown, then that backlash is seen from India's side.  In fact, the Government of India has also recently passed a law here, Geo Special Information Regulation Bill, under which if the borders of India are misrepresented in any way, then it will be considered illegal.  So India has done such things also.  And what is special is that this is a huge crisis for Israel as well. Because what Israel is currently trying to do is to garner as much support diplomatically as it can from around the world, and a mistake like this could cost it its credibility.  Particularly, India is an ally of Israel and one of the few countries which have always strengthened their ties with Israel.   In fact, if you look at the recent times, Israel had attacked Iran.   Just yesterday, PM Modi received a call from Nitin Yau and Nitin Yau explained why they had attacked, what had happened and even at that time, if you see, PM Modi spoke to him and said for restoration of stability after the Israeli strike.  So you will get to see this scenario overall. But I hope that as per the discussions that were going on regarding this, Israel has apologized.  So you must have understood what is the reason behind this?  And before I go, a very interesting question. Recently, there is a lot of discussion about Arrow 3 in this war.
