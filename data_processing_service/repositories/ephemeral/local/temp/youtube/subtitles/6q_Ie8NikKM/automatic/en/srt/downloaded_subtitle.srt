00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
Hello Friends.  Friends, recently

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,000
a map was released by Israel

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,639
to garner support in the world

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,200
in the midst of the Israel-Iran war.  Meaning, here we

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,040
can show the world that Iran is

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
not just a threat to Israel.   There

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
is a danger to the whole world.  But

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,279
he made a big mistake inside this map.  And

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,199
seeing this he had to apologise.

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,680
Because if you look at social media in India, a

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,160
huge backlash was seen.

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,960
You can see this news Israel Iran tension

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,519
IDF, basically this is Israel Defense Forces.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,200
They apologize to Indians over wrong

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
map.  So let us understand this in a little detail,

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,040
what exactly has happened here?  You will

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,800
get to know a lot.  Look, first of all

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,960
you should look at its background here.  You

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,960
all know that a

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,960
big war is going on between Israel and Iran.  And in

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,559

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,280
view of this, the Israeli Defense Forces released an infographic map

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,920
in which they

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
tried to show how far Iran's missiles can reach.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
If you see this, here

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
this tweet has been made by the Israeli Defense Forces

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
in which they have said that Iran is a

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
global threat.  So basically Israel is telling the

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,880
whole world that this is not just a

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,280
threat to us.  Israel is not the end goal.

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,080
It is only the beginning.  If we are

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,640
attacked, it will be just the beginning.  We

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,640
had no other choice but to act.  And because of this

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
we were left with no option.

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,920
And that is why we

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,240
started Operation Rising Lion here.  And the

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
intent of these Israel Defense Forces was to

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,119
warn the international community that

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,759
look at how Iran can

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,600
today fire its missiles as far as Europe.

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,759
So in fact if I

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,159
tell you what is shown inside the map?

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,560
Inside the map, an attempt has been made to show basically a radial range map

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
that if Iran

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,520
launches its ballistic missiles, then

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,200
how far it can reach and

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,439
here the different ranges are shown in circles

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,079
300 500 800 1300 2000

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,000
Km.  Iran currently has a range of more than that.

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,840
If you look at this,

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,399
here are the different missiles of Iran,

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,680
for example 300 km.

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,600
You will get to see Fateh 110, a short range system with a range of .

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
Apart from this there is

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,520
500 Km.  It became a Zulfiqar class missile.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,440
800 Km  1300 Km  Here

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,480
you will see Shahab three missiles.

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,040
And the most important thing is 2000 km.

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,520
If you look at the range of , then this missile

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,800
can actually reach India also.  And if

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,200
you look here, it is Gadr 110.  Sejil is

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,239
done.  So there are many such new variants which

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,160

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
can fire missiles even at Iran and India.  So if we talk about its range, then the

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,080
entire Middle East is covered.

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,000

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
These missiles can reach all the Gulf states, Iraq, Israel, Syria, Turkey, Afghanistan in South Asia, Pakistan and even India.

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,760
And in fact,

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,360
within Europe, their missiles can reach Greece, Bulgaria and

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,360
Romania.

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
And some parts

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599
of Africa became Libya, became Sudan.  You

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
can see almost the entire thing is being covered.

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,319
Ethiopia is getting covered.  Meaning, an

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,720
attempt was made by Israel to show a radial range

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,480
that these missiles

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,400
can be lethal for the entire world.  So a

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,120
strategic messaging was being given here.  In

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,000
a way, you can understand that Israel, by

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,239
showing the missile range,

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,360
was telling the world that Iran is not just

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,200
our problem.  It's yours too.  Apart from this,

84
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
he was also trying to garner public support here.  Was

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,760

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,239
trying to garner diplomatic support.  Across

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,920
Europe and Asia.  And along with this you

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,720
can see that it is also being said that the

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Israeli Defense Forces have carried

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,239
out dozens of air strike carriers on Iran.

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,319
You must have seen that since yesterday there has been continuous

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,640
news that their

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,040
nuclear sites in Iran have been attacked in some way.

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,000
So the purpose behind it

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,159
, the rationale behind it was that

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,799
Israel was in a way showing it to the world.

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,599
And along with this a psychological pressure was

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,080
also put on Iran that

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,239
if we show Iran in a negative sense, then in

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
a way Iran will be a little constrained

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
that it will

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,720
not develop missiles etc. the way it is doing now.

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,879
So now the question arises, what happened?

104
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,519
What's the problem with this?  What's Wrong in

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,920
the Map?  Now his intention here was to

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,480

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
send a message to the international responses and alliances.

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,080
But what did he do by mistake here

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,040
?  The map of Jammu and Kashmir

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,040
including Ladakh basically

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
shows a part of Pakistan.  As you all know,

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
this is a very sensitive issue

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,040
in India.  Whenever such things happen

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,880
then backlash is seen here.

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,199
If you look carefully, this is a zoomed-in

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,199
map, you can see clearly inside the map that an

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,120

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,199
attempt has been made to show this part of Pakistan in this manner.  In

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,840
fact, an attempt was made to show almost the

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,000
entire Jammu and Kashmir

121
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,639
in the map of Pakistan, including the

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,400
Aksai symbol.  So because of this,

123
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,199
if you look at the immediate

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,680
reactions here, the Indians on social media

125
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,759
immediately pointed out this error

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,400
and said that the

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,720
territorial sovereignty of India is undermine.  There are

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,960
many Indians who

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,800
support Israel diplomatically and ideologically.  There

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,720
is a lot of support for Israel in India.

131
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
So he also said here in a

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,759
way that it is very disappointing

133
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,520
that Israel is not taking care of all these things.

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,240
Some users here

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,199
also called it insensitive.  It was said

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,520
that it was unacceptable, that in a way, how could Israel, which is a close ally of India, make

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,600
such a mistake.

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,600
Many believed that this

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,440
could be an innocent mistake.  An

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
attempt may also be being made to give a diplomatic message.

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,919
So you will get to see different opinions here.

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,240
But it was certain that the

143
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,919
people who were constantly on social media were very

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
angry.  In fact you can see there is a

145
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,080
tweet here now you understand why

146
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,240
India remains neutral.  This question arises many times,

147
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,880
like for example, when India

148
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,720
carried out Operation Sindoor, a

149
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
call immediately came from Israel and they said that we

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,120
fully support you.  But

151
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,560
you never get to see the same thing from the Indian side.  It is

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,400
often seen

153
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
that India remains neutral in these things.

154
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
Because India's relations with Muslim majority countries are

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
also quite good at present.

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
So because of this some users are now

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,280
saying that look this is the biggest

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,319
reason due to which India often

159
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,400
remains neutral.  No one is really your friend in diplomacy.  It is

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
not necessary that at what moment a person will

161
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,720
be your friend and at what moment he will become your enemy.

162
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,639
So this kind of ideology was

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,880
visible on social media.  But it is obvious that

164
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,039
Israel also knew that this was

165
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
not right and they immediately apologized and asked for forgiveness.

166
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,120
If you see here, you can see that Israel also knew that this was not right and they immediately apologized and

167
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,759
asked for forgiveness.  If you can see here,

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,560
Israel was in a way saying that the

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,880
map shown was not the correct illustration.  In

170
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,199
fact, I was seeing on every tweet

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,160
that the Indians who had posted the message here had

172
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,160
replied regarding that map,

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
for example the map posted by Israel

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
Defense Forces incorrectly shows Jammu and

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,280
Kashmir as part of Pakistan.  So if

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,280
you look below every message, you will see that the Israel

177
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,360
Defense Forces have tweeted and

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,479
replied that this post is

179
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,039
an illustration of the region.  This map fails

180
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,600
to precisely determine the border.  He is

181
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,960
not deciphering it correctly.  We apologize for

182
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,000
any offence caused by this image.  So

183
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,080
if any offence has been committed here or any kind

184
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,759
of mistake has been made, we apologize for it.  In

185
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,240
fact here again you

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,479
can see Use Correct Map of India and

187
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
regarding this also the same message has been

188
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
given by the Israeli Defense Forces.  Now see

189
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
why all these things matter?   The

190
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,240
most important is the relationship between India and Israel.

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
If you look at the relations between India and Israel,

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,440

193
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,680
you will

194
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,400
find that everything is very strong, be it diplomatically, defence or technology, and both

195
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,400
countries often support each other on international forums.

196
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,800
But this kind of

197
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,960
blunder, even if it is unintentional, the

198
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,199
public sentiments here

199
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,280
can suddenly flare up at any time and

200
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,840
somewhere or the other, especially at this time, you all know

201
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,000
that global alliances are being tested to see

202
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,160
which country is with which country; a

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,319
lot of discussions have started taking place these days

204
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,479
in geopolitics and especially the

205
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,039
issue of Kashmir, you all know that

206
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,280
how core an issue it is for India and this is

207
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,360
not just about Israel, if you see, at

208
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,280
many places, be it Google Maps or

209
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,520
United Nations or in many foreign tax

210
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,759
text books, when the correct map of India is

211
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,599
not shown, then that backlash is seen from India's side.  In

212
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
fact, the

213
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,199
Government of India has

214
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,759
also recently passed a law here, Geo

215
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,919
Special Information Regulation Bill,

216
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,919
under which if the borders of India are misrepresented in any way, then

217
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,400

218
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,800
it will be considered illegal.  So

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,879
India has done such things also.  And

220
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,039
what is special is that this is a huge crisis for Israel as well.

221
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,960
Because

222
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,280
what Israel is currently trying to do is to garner

223
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,919
as much support diplomatically as it

224
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,399
can from around the world, and a mistake like this

225
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,440

226
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,320
could cost it its credibility.  Particularly, India

227
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,120
is an ally of Israel and one of the few

228
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,080
countries which have always strengthened their ties

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,920
with Israel.   In

230
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
fact, if you look at the

231
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,839
recent times, Israel had attacked Iran.   Just

232
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
yesterday, PM Modi received a call from

233
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
Nitin Yau and Nitin Yau explained

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,680
why they had attacked, what had happened

235
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,240
and even at that time, if you see, PM

236
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,360
Modi spoke to him and said for

237
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,680
restoration of stability after the Israeli

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
strike.  So you will get to see this scenario overall.

239
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,200
But I hope that as per the

240
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,760
discussions that were going on regarding this, Israel has

241
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,680
apologized.  So you must have understood

242
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
what is the reason behind this?  And

243
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,440
before I go, a very interesting question.

244
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,959
Recently, there is a lot of discussion about Arrow 3 in this war.

245
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800

246
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,480
Can you tell me what Arrow Three

247
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
exactly is?  You have to tell out of these three options

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,360
and you all know the right answer.  You

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160

topper behind it like but nothing works for

287

me.  I was like it, it won't happen, let's leave it.  If it is

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,600
not happening then what is the use of

289
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,839
reading them again and again?
