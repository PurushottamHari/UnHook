Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, as you all know, this year's G7 summit is being hosted by Canada. This question was being asked for a long time whether PM Modi will go there as guest or not. At last, it was confirmed that PM Modi is definitely going here and everyone was assuming that the biggest news in this entire summit will be how PM Modi is welcomed and what will happen in this summit. But suddenly Donald Trump has done some things due to which this entire summit has become a joke and clearly Donald Trump does not seem to want to keep this group alive for long. Donald Trump recently made a big statement that he wants the G7 to be expanded.  Now when the expansion was being discussed here, people thought that India which is going as a guest country to the G7 summit, perhaps India will be added as a G8 country and will become the eighth member, but no, suddenly Donald Trump shocked the entire Western world by saying that I want G7 to be made G8 by bringing Russia back. By the way, let me tell you that before 2013-14, G7 used to be G8.  Then Russia was definitely a part of this group.  Later, when Russia initially occupied Crimea in Ukraine, in response Western countries expelled Russia from G8 and G8 became G7.  Recently Trump said that this is a big mistake of the western world. I look at the G7 to be the G8. Obama had rushed in, then I would make a mistake, I think you never right now rush in. You must have just heard that Trump said that Barack Obama and a man named Troe, both of them together had thrown Russia out of the G8, then it became G7, this was a big mistake. Donald Trump is saying all these things while standing in Canada during the G7 Sawan Summit and the person with whom he is standing is Mark Carney, who is the current Prime Minister of Canada and is also a very good friend of Justin Trudeau. Both belong to the same party. But look at the US, its dominance is so high.  The US has so much power that Donald Trump said all this and Mark Carney could not even interrupt him and ask what are you saying standing in my country and interestingly Trump did not stop here.  Further, he also said that by expanding G7, they should first add Russia and then China. Make G7 into G9.  And for once you can say that Trump's statement is quite shocking.  But Donald Trump has given a lot of clarity to India. Because there was a time when there was no debate in India on whether we should consider USA a dependable partner or not, whether we should buy Air Force equipment from here or not.  Now look, we have understood one thing.  If there is any transport aircraft etc., that is a different matter.  But fighter jets should not be bought from USA at all because again these people do not have any proper foreign policy.  On one hand Trump says that China is a challenge for them. Their Defense Secretary says that China is a big threat.   On the other hand, Trump says that China should be included in G9 by expanding G7.  And nowhere does it say to make G9 into G10. Add India here too.  No statement what so ever.  And at least I would say that now India has got proper clarity. And India is now able to take big decisions regarding many decisions. For example, let me tell you that this month there is a very important summit of Defense Ministers of the SCO Shanghai Corporation Organization.  It was not clear whether India's Rajnath Singh would go to China or not.  But today, India-China relations are being rebuilt and in the meantime, Rajnath Singh has also announced that he is going to China and at the same time, it is also being known from sources that India is positively looking at RIC, the Russia India-China Group, about which the Russian Foreign Minister recently said that it should be restarted.  Look, these statements of Trump are that it is sure that Russia and China are not going to come back to G7, G8 or G9 are not going to be formed. By saying all this, Don't Trump has scored an own goal; here he has given India a big reason to keep a mistrust regarding US policy and suppose tomorrow any US official says that why are you attending RIC, why are you attending the SEO summit, then we have to directly show Trump's statement that your President is saying this. You tell me why should we not form BRICS?  When you people yourself are saying that you want to include China in G7. Now, by making such absurd statements in just a few hours, Donald Trump had already weakened this year's G7 summit to a great extent. After that Trump says, I will not be able to stay for long. Meaning, by the time PM Modi reaches to attend this summit, Donald Trump would have already gone back to the US. What is the reason?  See, everyone knew the reason.  The situation between Israel and Iran is getting a little worse.  And if one world leader, as we say in local language, teased Donald Trump a bit for fun, then it was Emmanuel Macron of France.  Emmanuel Macron gave this statement that look, Donald Trump is a little busy.  They want to enforce ceasefire between Israel and Iran.  No, this line has obviously been said by Emmanuel Macron in a teasing way because Trump repeatedly keeps talking about ceasefire between India and Pakistan.  Whereas India has categorically rejected this fact many times that no ceasefire was ordered by USA. But still Donald Trump has said 14 times that I had ordered ceasefire between India and Pakistan.  And as soon as Trump heard this word, cease fire.  Trump got angry and lashed out at Emmanuel Machara on social media.  I cannot believe that a US President has posted this and here you can see that Donald Trump has written that publicity seeking President Emmanuel Machho, French President Emmanuel Machho is hungry for publicity. He mistakenly said that I left the G7 summit so that I could enforce a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Wrong here again Trump understood what Macro was trying to do and when Trump gets even the slightest feeling that he is being made fun of, he becomes aggressive and starts tweeting such things. So he said here that no, I did not go to get any ceasefire imposed. Emmanuel Machara has no idea why I'm going to Washington.  He has no idea why I'm now on my way to Washington but it certainly has nothing to do with cease fire.  Much bigger than that. I want to do something even bigger than that. I absolutely want this war to end this time.  I want to end it. He said there will be no ceasefire this time, now what does end mean is that some regime changes will be made in Iran.  We will bomb Tehran on a heavy scale so that no one survives. We don't really know.  But after Emmanuel Machia 's statement, Donald Trump became very angry.  And this time's G7 summit has already become a joke.   The US President is not here.  There is talk of bringing Russia back here. Whereas all G7 countries have imposed sanctions on Russia.  If someone purchases oil from Russia, then the rest of the G7 countries thwart that country. And now they are saying bring Russia back into G7.  Whereas it doesn't even make any sense.  Because G7 countries are based on the principle that the seven largest economies globally should be in the G7, G8 or G9.  Let's take a look at what happens if I completely ignore the geopolitical equation.  Ok?  So we can bring this to China for once by saying that China is very important.  But then bring India into that case also.  Because if I look at the list of countries and you have to make G9, then these nine countries that you can see there, from rank nine to rank one, all these countries should be combined to make G8 where there is India and China but Russia is at rank 11.  Russia's economy has also fallen behind Brazil.  If I talk about nominal GDP, then on what basis is the talk of bringing Russia back here. It is a complete circus and that is why it is said that G7 has no relevance left in today's time and that is why I believe that the way G7 has been made a joke, India should not send its Prime Minister to the upcoming G7 summit and the Foreign Minister is enough.  I actually would like to know, your opinion is in front of you here. What G7 has become?  The G20 is different. More countries participate in G20 and such things happen less there. So here I would like to know whether you believe that in future G7 summits, it is enough if the Foreign Minister is sent there instead of the Prime Minister.  Because again this is not a serious summit anymore. Write about it in the comment section. I would like to know your opinion.
