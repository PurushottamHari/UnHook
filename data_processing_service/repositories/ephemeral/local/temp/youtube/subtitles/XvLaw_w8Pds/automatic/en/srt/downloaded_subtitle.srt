00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,759
Prashant Dhawan. Now, as you all know, this

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,160
year's G7 summit is being hosted by Canada.

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,039
This question was being asked for a long time

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,520
whether PM Modi will go there as guest or

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,760
not. At last, it was confirmed that

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,880
PM Modi is definitely going here and

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,279
everyone was assuming that the biggest news in this entire summit will be

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,679

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,120
how PM Modi is welcomed and what will happen in this summit.

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,680
But suddenly Donald Trump has

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,239
done some things due to which

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,520
this entire summit has become a joke

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,000
and clearly Donald Trump does not seem to

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,559
want to keep this group alive for long.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,280
Donald Trump recently made a big

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,160
statement that he wants the G7 to be

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,239
expanded.  Now when the

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,399
expansion was being discussed here,

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,199
people thought that India which is

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,160
going as a guest country to the G7 summit, perhaps

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,720
India will be added as a G8 country and will

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,119
become the eighth member, but no, suddenly

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Donald Trump shocked the entire Western world by

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,560
saying that I want

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,200
G7 to be made G8 by bringing Russia back.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,960
By the way, let me tell you that

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,439
before 2013-14, G7 used to be G8.  Then Russia was definitely a

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,520
part of this group.  Later, when Russia

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,400
initially occupied Crimea in Ukraine,

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,280
in response Western countries

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,799
expelled Russia from G8 and G8

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,079
became G7.  Recently Trump said that this is a

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,200
big mistake of the western world. I look at the

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,400
G7 to be the G8.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,240
Obama had

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,439
rushed in, then I would make a mistake, I think you never right now

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,000
rush in. You must have just heard that

39
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,720
Trump said that Barack Obama

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,520
and a man named Troe, both of them

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,920
together had thrown Russia out of the G8,

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,920
then it became G7, this was a big mistake.

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,879
Donald Trump is saying all these things while standing in Canada

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,360
during the G7 Sawan Summit

45
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,920
and the person with whom he is standing is Mark

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,080
Carney, who is the current Prime Minister of Canada

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,760
and is also a very good friend of Justin Trudeau.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,239
Both belong to the same party.

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,160
But look at the US, its dominance is so

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,239
high.  The US has so much power

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,560
that Donald Trump said all this and

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
Mark Carney could not even interrupt him and ask what are

53
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
you saying standing in my country

54
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,920
and interestingly Trump did

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,720
not stop here.  Further, he

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,440
also said that by expanding G7, they should

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,560
first add Russia and then China.

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
Make G7 into G9.  And for once

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,599
you can say that Trump's statement is

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,519
quite shocking.  But Donald

61
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,319
Trump has given a lot of clarity to India.

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,879
Because there was a time when there was no debate in India on whether

63
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,599
we should consider USA a dependable

64
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,160
partner or not, whether we should buy Air Force

65
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,160
equipment from here or not.  Now look,

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,400
we have understood one thing.  If there is any

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,959
transport aircraft etc., that

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,680
is a different matter.  But fighter jets should not be bought from USA at all

69
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,480
because again these people do

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
not have any proper foreign policy.  On one hand

71
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,599
Trump says that China is a challenge for them.

72
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,840
Their Defense Secretary

73
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,280
says that China is a big threat.   On the

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,840
other hand, Trump says that China should be

75
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,280
included in G9 by expanding G7.  And nowhere does

76
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,280
it say to make G9 into G10.

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Add India here too.  No statement what so

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,599
ever.  And at least I would say that

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
now India has got proper clarity.

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,680
And India is now able to take big decisions regarding many decisions.

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,720
For example, let me

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,200
tell you that this month there is

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,840
a very important

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,920
summit of Defense Ministers of the SCO Shanghai Corporation Organization.  It was not clear

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,319
whether India's Rajnath Singh would

86
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
go to China or not.  But today,

87
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,959
India-China

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,519
relations are being rebuilt and in the meantime, Rajnath Singh has

89
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,840
also announced that he is going to China

90
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,560
and at the same time, it is also being known from sources

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,159
that India is positively

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,640
looking at RIC, the Russia India-China

93
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,640
Group, about which the Russian

94
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,200
Foreign Minister recently said that it should be

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,840
restarted.  Look, these

96
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,120
statements of Trump are that it is sure that

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,000
Russia and China are not going to come back to G7,

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,040
G8 or G9 are not going to be formed. By saying all this,

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,160
Don't Trump has scored an own goal;

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,720
here he has given India a big reason to

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,360
keep a mistrust regarding US policy and

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,600
suppose tomorrow any US official says that

104
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,600
why are you attending RIC,

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,680
why are you attending the SEO summit, then

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,919
we have to directly show Trump's statement that

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,000
your President is saying this.

108
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,840
You tell me why should we not

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,199
form BRICS?  When you people yourself are saying

110
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,440
that you want to include China in G7.

111
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,680
Now, by making such absurd statements in just a few hours,

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,880
Donald Trump had already

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,600
weakened this year's G7 summit to a great extent.

114
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,440
After that Trump says,

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,160
I will not be able to stay for long.

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,720
Meaning, by the time PM Modi reaches to attend this summit,

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,120

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,000
Donald Trump would have already gone back to the US.

119
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,400
What is the reason?  See, everyone knew the reason.  The

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,960
situation between Israel and Iran is

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,600
getting a little worse.  And if one world

122
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,479
leader, as we say in local language,

123
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,280

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,840
teased Donald Trump a bit for fun, then it was

125
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,240
Emmanuel Macron of France.  Emmanuel Macron

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,880
gave this statement that look, Donald Trump is a little

127
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,759
busy.  They want to

128
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,840
enforce ceasefire between Israel and Iran.  No, this line has

129
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,280
obviously been said by Emmanuel Macron

130
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,440
in a teasing way because Trump

131
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
repeatedly keeps talking about ceasefire

132
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
between India and Pakistan.  Whereas India has

133
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,000
categorically rejected this fact

134
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,960
many times that no ceasefire was ordered by USA.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,600
But still Donald Trump has said 14 times

136
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,960
that I had ordered ceasefire

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,680
between India and Pakistan.  And as soon as Trump

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,160
heard this word, cease fire.  Trump got angry

139
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,039
and lashed out at Emmanuel Machara

140
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,880
on social media.  I cannot believe that a

141
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,560
US President has posted this and

142
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,120
here you can see that Donald Trump has

143
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,039
written that publicity seeking President

144
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,840
Emmanuel Machho, French President

145
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,440
Emmanuel Machho is hungry for publicity.

146
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,560
He mistakenly said that I

147
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,600
left the G7 summit so that I

148
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,479
could enforce a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

149
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,960
Wrong here again Trump understood

150
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,280
what Macro was trying to do and when

151
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,080
Trump gets even the slightest feeling that

152
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,759
he is being made fun of, he becomes aggressive

153
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
and starts tweeting such things.

154
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,680
So he

155
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,160
said here that no, I did not go to get any ceasefire imposed.

156
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,919
Emmanuel Machara has

157
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,880
no idea why I'm going to Washington.  He has

158
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,840
no idea why I'm now on

159
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,280
my way to Washington but it certainly has nothing

160
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,120
to do with cease fire.  Much bigger than that.

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,240
I want to do something even bigger than that.

162
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,720
I absolutely want this war to

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,560
end this time.  I want to end it.

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
He said there will be no ceasefire this time,

165
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,599
now what does end mean is that some

166
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,919
regime changes will be made in Iran.  We

167
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,440
will bomb Tehran on a heavy scale so that no one survives.

168
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,599
We don't really know.  But after Emmanuel Machia

169
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,240
's statement, Donald Trump became very

170
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,280
angry.  And this time's G7

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,840
summit has already become a joke.   The

172
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,759
US President is not here.  There is talk

173
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,479
of bringing Russia back here.

174
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,199
Whereas all G7 countries have

175
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,240
imposed sanctions on Russia.  If someone purchases oil from Russia, then the

176
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,880
rest of the G7 countries thwart that country.

177
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,440
And now they are saying

178
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,840
bring Russia back into G7.  Whereas

179
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,880
it doesn't even make any sense.  Because

180
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,400
G7 countries are based on the principle that the

181
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,639
seven largest economies globally

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,599
should be in the G7, G8 or G9.  Let's take a

183
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,639
look at what happens if I completely

184
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,039
ignore the geopolitical equation.  Ok?  So we

185
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,120
can bring this to China for once by saying

186
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,599
that China is very important.  But then

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,879
bring India into that case also.  Because if I

188
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,360
look at the list of countries and you have to make G9, then

189
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,319
these nine countries that you can see there,

190
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,599
from rank nine to rank one, all these

191
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,440
countries should be combined to make G8 where there is

192
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,319
India and China but Russia

193
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,320
is at rank 11.  Russia's economy has also

194
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,560
fallen behind Brazil.  If

195
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
I talk about nominal GDP, then on what basis is the talk of

196
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,880
bringing Russia back here.

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,039
It is a complete circus and that is why it is said that

198
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,839
G7 has no relevance left in today's

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,399
time and that is why I believe that the

200
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,440
way G7 has been made a joke,

201
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,200
India should not send its Prime Minister to the upcoming G7 summit and the

202
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
Foreign

203
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
Minister is enough.  I actually would like to know,

204
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,279
your opinion is in front of you here.

205
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,440
What G7 has become?  The G20 is different.

206
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,760
More countries participate in G20

207
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
and such things happen less there.

208
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,800
So here I would like to know

209
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,680
whether you believe that in future G7 summits, it is

210
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,440

211
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,880
enough if the Foreign Minister is sent there instead of the Prime Minister.  Because

212
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,880
again this is not a serious summit anymore.

213
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
Write about it in the comment section.

214
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,920
I would like to know your opinion.  Look,

215
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,000
I believe that if you are

216
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,240
not using Artificial Intelligence

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,040
in your work today, then you are living in a different era

218
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,519
because with the help of AI, you

219
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,680
can do many jobs.  You can make a lot of

220
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
money.  You can skill yourself now.

221
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,920
For example, suppose

222
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,480
I want to show that Captain America is

223
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,240

224
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
eating Vada Pav in some busy street of Mumbai and on it is written a very

225
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,120
attractive text 'Yummy'.  So

226
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,000
I can do that easily by putting in the right preamp.

227
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,720
And here you can see it was

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,600
just that easy, you can make many variants of it.

229
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,240
If I want to move this image,

230
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,920
I can do it in the way

231
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,720
you can see on your screen.

232
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,519
I

233
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,839
can make this image move with the help of lots of generative AI software.   I

234
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,160
can create a story.  I can

235
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,880
pretty much do anything.  And this is just one

236
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,399
small, I mean one very small,

237
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,640
aspect of generative AI.

238
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,640

239
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,440
