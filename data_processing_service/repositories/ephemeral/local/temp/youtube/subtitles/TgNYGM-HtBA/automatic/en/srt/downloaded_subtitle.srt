1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,839
I've created 900 podcasts with people

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,680
who believe to be in the top 1% of

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,400
humankind. This is what I've learned

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,880
over the last 6 years of my career

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,280
sitting across the grades and seeing the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,760
common patterns in all their lives. We

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,279
live in a world that's all about

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
disruption.

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,160
Over the course of this documentary, I'm

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,439
going to present game plans, templates,

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,560
and architectures for you. the average

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,559
20some, the average 30some, the kind of

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,520
skill sets you need for success are

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,600
constantly changing. Considering the

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
revolution that artificial intelligence

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,360
is bringing, the only thing truly in

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,719
your control are your personal systems,

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,800
which should be built using the systems

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
that the greats have used in order to

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
become the greats. This entire

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,840
documentary is divided into seven

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,399
chapters. Each chapter will lead you

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,000
into developing a game plan for your

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,879
day, for your year, and for your decade.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
We bring you our first documentary. This

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,610
is how you design your life to break

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,790
into the top 1%.

Chopra, Serena Williams, Kohley. None of

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,479
these people scroll on their Instagram

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,040
reels or Tik Tok for 3 hours before they

34
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,159
go to sleep because all of these people

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,399
have likely mastered their own dopamine

36
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,560
systems.

37
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,680
According to studies done by frontiers

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,240
in behavioral neuroscience, dopamine is

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,880
highlighted as a critical driver of

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,920
behavioral activation.

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,319
That means it helps organisms overcome

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,879
effort costs to obtain rewards.

43
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,680
The first rule is that everyone's

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,080
different. If I just tell you what the

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
top 1% did in terms of their time

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,640
management, you're going to have 900

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,280
different cases of time management. But

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,160
the one commonality in all these 900

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,879
cases is that each of them were

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,120
extremely self-aware. They knew exactly

51
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,920
what it takes to move forward in their

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,640
career. And they also knew exactly what

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,360
habits pull them back from moving

54
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,400
forward in their career. First things

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,640
first, it's not about managing just your

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
time. Eventually, if you work hard

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,599
enough, you'll figure out how to manage

58
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,280
your time. Firstly, you've got to learn

59
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,130
how to manage your own subjective

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,259
dopamine systems.

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
Now to truly understand how dopamine

63
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,959
affects our daily lives, let's look at

64
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,080
relatable cases. Case one is of a

65
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,280
regular young person today lying in bed

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,879
scrolling through reals, shorts, Tik

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,879
Toks.

68
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,560
Dopamine hit after dopamine hit. This is

69
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,920
the modernday version of smoking

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,200
cigarettes. Every swipe gives you that

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,680
tiny little reward. But let me ask you,

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,440
do you remember even 20% of the total

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,879
short content pieces that you watched

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,879
yesterday? Likely no. The only effort

75
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,159
that you're putting in is using your

76
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,400
finger to move on to the next reel. But

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,120
here's the science of what's happening.

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,159
When you get a big spike in dopamine

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,560
without earning it, your brain reacts by

80
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,400
dropping your dopamine levels below

81
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,879
where they started. So, there's

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,840
something called baseline dopamine,

83
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,400
which is where your dopamine levels

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,439
began, perhaps before you ever started

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,439
using reals. Every time you consume a

86
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,599
real that you like, of course, you're

87
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,239
getting a dopamine spike. But once that

88
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,320
spike of dopamine settles down, your

89
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,280
baseline dopamine doesn't stay where it

90
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,280
was, goes a little lower, and you end up

91
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,440
feeling like crap. You end up feeling

92
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,600
demotivated. That's that headache you

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,560
get after using short content for that

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,479
long. And this is one of the basic

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,280
points that you need to understand about

96
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,040
dopamine before we move forward. That an

97
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,960
excess of anything can drop the dopamine

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,280
levels in your bloodstream and can

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,960
basically leave you feeling like crap.

100
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,199
This is what we call a dopamine crash.

101
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,560
The higher the high, the deeper the

102
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,680
crash. And that crash can last for hours

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,800
or even days. depending on how intense

104
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,040
the stimulation was.

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,360
Imagine that this is your bloodstream.

106
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,840
This is your dopamine reserve in your

107
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
bloodstream. Currently, you're feeling

108
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,560
fresh. Your dopamine levels are

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,120
regulated. But if you try getting

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,160
yourself intoxicated or you try enjoying

111
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,720
yourself or if you wish to give some

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,440
energy to your work, if you want to do

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,759
something productive, in both cases,

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,479
your dopamine system releases some

115
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,880
dopamine into your bloodstream. Now,

116
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,120
clearly the levels of dopamine that are

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,360
available in your body are lesser

118
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,880
because some of it has already gone to

119
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,400
your bloodstream.

120
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,199
So, this glass needs time to be

121
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,720
refilled. The higher the degree of

122
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,039
indulgence or hustle, the longer it'll

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,039
take for your dopamine levels to get

124
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,039
regulated.

125
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,160
We use the reals example to explain it

126
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,080
from a daily life perspective, but all

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
forms of addiction that leave you

128
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,600
feeling like crap work in the same

129
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,160
manner. The worst part of being in that

130
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,479
low phase with lower levels of dopamine

131
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,840
is that your brain craves more dopamine

132
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
when there's a lack of it in your

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,080
bloodstream. So you pull out your phone

134
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,600
again, you start scrolling again, you

135
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
open up that pack of cigarettes again,

136
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,919
you roll a joint again, you eat junk

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,000
again, but each time you do that, you're

138
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,160
digging a deeper hole for yourself

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,319
because eventually every drop in

140
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,800
dopamine is going to be lower than the

141
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,680
previous drop. The game is all about

142
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,160
fixing these drops in dopamine. You have

143
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,680
to start earning your dopamine again

144
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
through effort, not shortcuts. And

145
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,479
that's the core of every successful

146
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,120
person in the world. They focus on the

147
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,000
slow release of dopamine over the course

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,960
of a 24-hour period or over the course

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,440
of 25 years of human life. The issue

150
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,000
isn't with dopamine itself, but it's

151
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,800
with your relationship with dopamine.

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,120
Over stimulation leads to depletion.

153
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,520
That's a misuse of our dopamine

154
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,919
circuitry. It's ignoring the fact that

155
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,800
dopamine is not infinite in its

156
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,639
availability. Your first cigarette will

157
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,919
always feel much better than your

158
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,639
1,000th cigarette. What the world calls

159
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,759
addiction is effectively your dopamine

160
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,479
systems malfunctioning in the long term.

161
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,520
But remember that glass needs time to

162
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:33,280
refill. There's a reservoir of dopamine

163
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,240
in your body and it can be depleted, but

164
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,240
it can also be replenished.

165
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,280
This is probably the most important

166
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,680
chapter in this whole documentary. It's

167
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,880
called Dopamine Green Flags versus

168
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,160
Dopamine Red Flags. Your decisions can

169
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,879
either fix your dopamine system or abuse

170
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,319
it and in the long term end up abusing

171
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,000
your health. Earned dopamine equals

172
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,240
green flags. This is the kind of

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,879
dopamine that's aligned with how our

174
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,919
brains evolved. This is an outcome of

175
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,520
effort, consistency, and long-term

176
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,919
thinking. The easiest way to get

177
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,720
long-term sustainable domain is working

178
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,120
hard at your career. The second building

179
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
long-term fitness or health by the same

180
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,400
consistent boring routines. The third is

181
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,080
consistent studying or upskilling for

182
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,360
self-development. Constant knowledge

183
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,399
accumulation. Next, starting a business

184
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,839
and gradually increasing your profits.

185
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,159
Finishing a workout. Meditating for a

186
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,080
certain amount of time every day.

187
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,399
Journaling. Learning something new every

188
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,080
day. Learning something challenging.

189
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,160
Solving a complex problem at work, deep

190
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,760
conversations that lead to some kind of

191
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,480
growth,

192
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,120
cooking a meal from scratch,

193
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,360
volunteering or helping someone or

194
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,000
adding value to society in some way.

195
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,279
This kind of dopamine trains your brain

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,480
to value effort. It creates long-term

197
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,360
satisfaction, not just quick pleasure.

198
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,640
But it's also important to understand

199
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,279
hijacked dopamine or the red flags. This

200
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,160
is where the system goes wrong. Modern

201
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,640
tech and lifestyle and the urban society

202
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,880
around us can trigger dopamine without

203
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
any real effort and that's what's

204
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,600
dangerous. Firstly, any kind of

205
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,560
stimulant, cigarettes, vapes, excess

206
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,560
coffee, any kind of quick addiction.

207
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,279
Second, as we spoke earlier, doom

208
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,360
scrolling obviously. Third, shopping

209
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,080
just to feel something without really

210
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,640
needing the clothes or the accessories.

211
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,839
Next one, super common addiction, or

212
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,760
even casual hookup cycles. Next, we're

213
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,959
talking about binge eating, binge

214
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,279
drinking, or even gambling. All of these

215
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,399
red flags give you short bursts of

216
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,720
dopamine, but the more you use them, the

217
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,399
more they drain your baseline

218
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,399
motivation.

219
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,200
Eventually, nothing feels exciting

220
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,279
anymore. And here's the brutal truth.

221
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,080
Your life is a sum total of which

222
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,920
dopamine side you choose to live on. You

223
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,480
can train your brain to chase things

224
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,839
that actually improve your life, or you

225
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,120
can train it to respond only to cheap,

226
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,120
fast hits of stimulation.

227
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,519
Now to explain this next input better,

228
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,120
I'm going to pick up the examples of

229
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,720
Priyanka Chopra, Virat Kohli and Arnold

230
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,440
Schwazenegger.

231
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,440
The templates associated with how these

232
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
people designed their own careers and

233
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,399
their own systems can be applied to any

234
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,320
other industry. Of course, all the

235
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,200
entrepreneurs I've spoken to also fall

236
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,240
under the same bracket. Now over the

237
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,279
course of 900 podcasts what I found in

238
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,760
common about the 1% is that all of them

239
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,399
have identified an industry that they

240
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,920
wish to flourish in but have also

241
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,440
identified one core skill that they

242
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,079
invested a lot of time in in order to

243
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,959
get better than the others in that

244
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,040
industry. The richest industries are

245
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,160
often also the most competitive

246
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,000
industries and the truth about careers

247
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,360
is that you need to be really really

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,519
good at one thing. Priyanka Chopra

249
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,519
progressively got better as an actor

250
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,560
over the course of her career. She

251
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,880
focused on being prepared. Virat Kohli

252
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,440
or any other cricketer that I spoke to

253
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,480
focused on their core skill of batting

254
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,279
or bowling through repetition. They put

255
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,560
in more hours repeating the same

256
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,200
processes until the skill got polished.

257
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,519
Anel Schwazenegger who had multiple

258
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,200
successful careers within one lifetime.

259
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,440
He found success because his core skill

260
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,800
was communication.

261
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,040
You need to identify one core skill

262
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,839
that's required for you to flourish in

263
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,120
your industry and give that skill

264
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,519
maximum hours. But also keep in mind,

265
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,200
you need to choose a skill that you

266
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,360
actually enjoy getting better at. That's

267
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,639
how you manage your own dopamine

268
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,360
systems. You need to feel a rush from

269
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,000
what you're working towards. As Naval

270
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,720
said, the trick is to choose a job that

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,240
looks like play to you, but work to

272
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
others.

273
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,399
Your practice should leave you with a

274
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,279
higher sense of energy than you felt

275
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,240
before you began practicing. take one

276
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,360
skill really really far.

277
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,279
Now, additionally, what all of the great

278
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,839
do is that they focus on three

279
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,560
additional skills other than that one

280
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:59,360
core skill. A cricketer's obviously got

281
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,360
to focus on fitness, branding as well as

282
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,160
other cricketing skills like fielding or

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,320
bowling. An actor has to understand

284
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,279
social media, has to understand

285
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,519
communication, has to understand PR.

286
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,079
Every single entrepreneur that I've ever

287
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,800
spoken to on the show constantly speaks

288
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,200
about the need for reinvention over the

289
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,680
course of business as well. And that

290
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,920
reinvention is only going to be an

291
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,560
outcome of you putting in hours of

292
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,680
studying additional skills that you add

293
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,600
along the course of your journey. But

294
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,680
the only additional pattern that I've

295
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,320
recognized over all these podcasts is

296
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,399
that over a decade, you'll figure out

297
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,839
how to upskill yourself for the sake of

298
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,160
your growth. After that 10ear mark, it

299
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,639
becomes all about managing your physical

300
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,600
health as well as your personal

301
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,399
relationships that aid your career.

302
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,560
Personal relationships fuel your mental

303
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,360
health positively and the physical

304
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,399
health leads you to having higher energy

305
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,040
levels to go about your upskilling

306
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,839
process faster and to be more productive

307
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,120
at your workplace. Have a look at all

308
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,760
these photos. The right side represents

309
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,880
people who have learned how to use their

310
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,040
dopamine systems correctly. The left

311
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,600
side represents people who've abused

312
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,160
those same dopamine systems.

313
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,720
The same mechanics have led to mega

314
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,800
success on the right and the destruction

315
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,079
of life on the left. Keep in mind where

316
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,600
you end up in terms of productivity or

317
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,880
career success or legacy is heavily

318
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,120
dependent on your own choices.

319
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,720
That's the case with the 900 people I

320
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,160
spoke to. Not everyone has fully cleaned

321
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,240
up their life. Everyone's got one vice

322
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,040
or another.

323
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,079
Your job is to understand what each of

324
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,199
those vices are and how each of your

325
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,440
habits are affecting your long-term

326
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,800
career prospects.

327
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,760
In the long term, your career is heavily

328
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,880
dependent on chemistry. But from a very

329
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,279
practical daily life basis, you need to

330
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,920
pay attention to the next chapter in

331
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,920
order to self analyze.

332
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,160
This chapter is all about selfanalysis.

333
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,560
How do you figure out your own dopamine

334
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,639
systems and your own dopamine spikes?

335
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,079
And this chapter matters because if you

336
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,199
want to retrain your brain and reclaim

337
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,320
your focus, your energy, your

338
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,120
motivation, you need to first understand

339
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,440
your dopamine related habits. Most

340
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,320
people go through life unaware of what's

341
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,320
hijacking their attention. And hopefully

342
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,600
this chapter will help you break that

343
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,079
loop. Step one, the dopamine journal.

344
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Grab a notebook. Firstly, list down five

345
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,199
things that you're addicted to or feel

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,240
dependent on. Be completely honest.

347
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,560
Nobody else is going to see this. And

348
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,120
ask yourself, are these activities

349
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,600
giving me effort-based dopamine or are

350
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,560
they giving me instant dopamine? Step

351
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,720
two, learn to spot the imbalance. Here

352
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,279
are the signs that your dopamine system

353
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,600
might be misfiring. Firstly, maybe you

354
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,680
need constant stimulation to feel okay.

355
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,839
Then maybe you're bored with everything

356
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,279
and even things you used to love just

357
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,440
seem very dry now. You procrastinate

358
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,519
even on goals that you genuinely care

359
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
about. Maybe your energy crashes

360
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,000
randomly throughout the day. Or you find

361
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,079
it hard to feel excited without a screen

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,720
or a substance. But you've got to keep

363
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,680
in mind is that it's not about being

364
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,399
perfect. No one's perfect. No one's life

365
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,560
is all about green flags. You don't need

366
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,120
to be David Gogggins. You're allowed

367
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,160
some kind of escapes. Make sure that

368
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,560
your escapes are conscious. The goal is

369
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,279
not to remove dopamine spikes from your

370
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,160
life. It's to try earning them as far as

371
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:08,240
possible and educating yourself about

372
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,520
your own cravings and then making

373
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,199
informed choices. Now, by this point,

374
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,760
you've probably figured out what's

375
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,319
holding you back in life versus what you

376
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,000
need to do to move forward in life. But

377
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,880
that's step zero in my eyes. Step one is

378
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,760
all about action with respect to your

379
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,520
career. But in order to move faster, in

380
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,400
order to break into that 1% faster, you

381
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,720
have to go ahead with a game plan, with

382
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,120
a bit of a strategy. And that's what

383
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,640
will be explained to you in the next

384
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,720
chapter.

385
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,440
This next chapter contains what we call

386
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,480
the rewire protocol in order to

387
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,200
re-engineer your life to break into that

388
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,200
1% bracket.

389
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Now, this kind of framework is not a

390
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,720
detox, but it's an optimization of your

391
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,360
daily systems. It will help you reset

392
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,960
your life one step at a time. So, let's

393
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,160
talk about rewiring your life. R stands

394
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,360
for reviewing triggers. Firstly, assess

395
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,840
the frequency. Go back to your red list.

396
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,440
How often are you engaging in each

397
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,919
activity? Once a week, every day,

398
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,280
multiple times a day. Ask yourself,

399
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,400
which is what brings us to E.

400
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,039
E stands for exchanging habits. The

401
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,160
replacement principle. The best way to

402
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,000
cut out any dopamine related addiction,

403
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,000
any kind of intoxicant, any kind of red

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,160
flag activity is to replace it with

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,559
something better. Ideally, use your own

406
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,000
green list. If those things don't excite

407
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,600
you, discover new ones. dance classes,

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,720
martial arts, team sports, trekking,

409
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:59,600
music, regularly consuming value adding

410
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:03,039
content. Moving on to W, wake and reset.

411
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,000
Designing a daily reset routine. Waking

412
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,640
up and stepping into the sunlight. This

413
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,760
boosts your natural dopamine and

414
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,080
supports your energy for the entire day.

415
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,200
Next, we move on to I, which is

416
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,520
introducing friction. Add friction to

417
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,240
all the red flag oriented dopamine

418
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,720
triggers. Make it hard to access

419
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,120
addictive habits. Log out of social

420
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
media. Keep your phone in another room.

421
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,520
Disable autoplay notifications. If it's

422
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,160
an intoxicant you're dealing with, don't

423
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
keep it at home. Try understanding that

424
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,559
if it's a friend of yours who's

425
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,120
responsible for your intoxicant

426
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,160
addiction, try keeping some distance

427
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,480
from that friend for some time. You have

428
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,720
to catch yourself before you begin to

429
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,720
play with your own dopamine systems.

430
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,600
Next are rally mini wins. Build momentum

431
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,400
with mini wins. Motivation follows

432
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,440
action. So start small. Just wear your

433
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,960
gym clothes. Just write one sentence.

434
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,080
Just clean one corner. These small wins

435
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,480
compound and naturally rebuild your

436
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,760
dopamine drive. E energize and restore.

437
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,559
Rest is not a luxury. Rest is your

438
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,200
brain's pause button in order to

439
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,440
replenish that glass. Replenish your

440
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,640
dopamine reservoirs.

441
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,919
Practices like yoga nidra or NSDR,

442
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,080
non-sleep deep rest. These can increase

443
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,159
baseline dopamine by up to 60%.

444
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,480
Going about a cold plunge or a cold

445
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
shower releases dopamine for a longer

446
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,600
duration.

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,240
So train your brain to earn its rewards.

448
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,919
That's how you build lasting motivation,

449
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,320
focus, and peace. The rewire protocol

450
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,280
followed correctly over an extended

451
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,880
period of time is exactly what leads

452
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,280
people into this 1% bracket. When people

453
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,320
say that your routines become your

454
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,360
story, this is what they mean. All of

455
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,480
them have applied a version of the

456
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,480
rewire protocol in their own personal

457
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
lives.

458
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,120
[Music]

459
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,250
Over

460
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,250
[Music]

461
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,320
the course of a 10 year career, I

462
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,039
figured that for me and my personal

463
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,520
headsp space, I need a break every 2 and

464
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:39,360
1/2 to 3 months. That's what really

465
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,200
keeps me going. Like I will visit every

466
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,880
vacation spot with a lot of negative

467
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
energy, with a lot of heaviness, with a

468
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,919
lot of exhaustion, but I'll always leave

469
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,559
with positivity irrespective of where I

470
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,720
go because there's something about a new

471
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,280
environment, new surroundings, so much

472
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:03,120
data for your mind to absorb, so much

473
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,120
of a change for your heart to feel. I

474
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,200
think that's what replenishes dopamine

475
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,360
reserves in the first place because

476
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,919
every single place I visited three or

477
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,799
four days in I'm raring to get back to

478
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,960
Mumbai and get back to creating videos.

479
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,600
I have so many new ideas. I have so much

480
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,679
freshness. I think the 10 year YouTube

481
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,520
career has been sustained through breaks

482
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,480
like this.

483
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,280
But this video is about the science. So

484
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,210
when it comes to these quarterly breaks,

485
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,720
here's what you need to know.

486
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:37,039
[Music]

487
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,840
Right from school to college to your

488
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,960
job, this is your longest most

489
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,480
effortbased phase of your life.

490
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,480
Everything that you achieve in the

491
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,880
material world. All the money that

492
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,960
you're making is an outcome of your

493
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,679
dopamine systems being in the right

494
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,520
place. Your dopamine systems are trained

495
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,440
through this journey. So whether it's

496
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,320
the great grade you got in school or

497
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,640
college or that fat pay package, it is

498
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,640
an outcome of your dopamine system. What

499
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,200
you're doing through watching this video

500
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,520
is also your dopamine system being at

501
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,120
play. But here's the catch. It's

502
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,480
important to know when to use it. If you

503
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,200
want to have a long arc life, if you

504
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,240
wish to achieve sustained success and a

505
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,159
long arc career, your goal has to be all

506
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,440
about mastering these transition states

507
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,320
as well. Because transition states allow

508
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,120
us to replenish the dopamine reserves

509
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,960
after a high dopamine activity. Every

510
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,159
time you see negative outcomes in a

511
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,720
person's life, it's this exact science

512
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,640
at play. They've not mastered their

513
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,520
transition states.

514
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,480
All forms of success first and foremost

515
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,480
come from discipline. But as Khabib once

516
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,120
said, what's more important than

517
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,799
discipline is sacrifice. Your life is an

518
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,720
outcome of your routines. And your

519
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,159
routines should be shaped up by

520
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,400
sacrificing on all the red flag dopamine

521
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,600
activities. Whether it's Naval Ravi

522
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:10,159
Kant, Priyanka Chopra, Karina Kapoor,

523
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,640
Ronaldo, Messi, Lamin, Yamal, name any

524
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,799
achiever and at the center of their life

525
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,720
you'll find routines and beneath those

526
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,520
routines, you'll discover their

527
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,520
sacrifices. That is the secret of

528
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,520
dopamine.

529
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,559
Ladies and gentlemen, this was our first

530
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,080
the show documentary. I'd love to

531
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,400
receive feedback from you and I hope

532
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,039
that you gained immense value over the

533
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
course of this entire game plan that

534
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,120
we've chocked out for you. The

535
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,960
description box contains scientific

536
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,760
research papers to back everything that

537
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,880
we've said, but it also contains a

538
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,600
document that contains this framework

539
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,240
that will help you improve the quality

540
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,320
of your life. Many more documentaries

541
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,640
are coming your way. Keep sending in

542
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,880
feedback and keep sending us topic

543
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,880
recommendations. Thank you for listening

544
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,880
in.
