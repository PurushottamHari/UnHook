I am saying this because yesterday a very rare statement was issued by the Financial Action Task Force. Meaning, FATF does not comment directly on any incident. But here FATF has accepted India's point.  India's stand is that yes, terror funding is behind the terror attack in Pahalgam.  Meaning this Pahalgam attack could not have happened without terror funding. You can see this news.  FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack, Says It Couldn't Have Happened Without Money.  So there is a need to understand this in a little detail as to what exactly is happening here. What will be the impact of this statement of FATF and can Pakistan be put in the grey list? I will tell you everything in detail as to when this is possible. Let's move on.  But before that friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are preparing for UPSC, whether in any language or if you want to take it in pure English, pure Hindi or English, it is available in all three languages.  You have to use this code AnkitLive to get maximum discount and you will get its link in the comment section. Let's get started. First of all, let me tell you that tomorrow there is FATF Financial Action Task Force, which is the most important body in the world that monitors money laundering and terror financing. He issued a rare public condemnation for the 2 April Pahalgam terror attack that took place in Jammu and Kashmir. And this incident marks only the third time in over a decade. If you look at the last decade, this is only the third time that FATF has highlighted a particular incident and has directly condemned this particular terrorist attack and said that this is very serious, meaning that somewhere it is being shown by FATF that we are taking this matter very seriously and somewhere you will also see its financial implications. Well, you all know about the terror attack that happened in Pahalgam on 2nd April in which 26 innocent civilians were killed and definitely the Pakistan based terror outfits behind this, be it Lashkar Taiba or Jaish-e-Mohammed, you all know that TRF was brought to the fore here and TRF had already accepted it, after that, somewhere Pakistan played a trick and started backing out through its own statement.  Well, whatever it is, it is clearly visible here that Pakistan had a hand in this.  So now the question is why is this statement of FATF so unpredictable ?  See here what FATF has said?  Please understand this carefully.  True attacks could not happen without money.  This attack which happened in Pahalgam would not have been possible without money. And the ability to move funds between terrorist supporters.  Meaning, the way money transactions are being done between the terrorists, this particular attack could not have been carried out without it.  So this statement of FATF implies that there is a direct financial link with terror activity.  This shows that organisational and cross border facilitation is happening somewhere. This is not an incident that happened in isolation. Somewhere or the other things have come from across the border.  Only then this particular incident was created.  Well, this statement shows that there is talk of promoting global vigilance.  The state actors and financial institutions are being told to try to stop such activities. Otherwise this can create a lot of problems. Well, when I talk about FATF, keep in mind that FATF was created in 1989 by G7 nations. Now you already know that PM Modi has also gone there and the G7 meeting is going on in Canada.  So it was established by him in 1989. Keep in mind that from your exam perspective its headquarter will be in Paris, France. What is its main focus ?  Basically, how to combat money laundering? Whatever international standards have to be set related to terror financing, they are done by them.  Well, how many members does it have?  Keep in mind there are 39 full members.  Out of 39, there are basically 37 countries and two organizations.  Organisations like GCC Gulf Cooperation Council and one of yours I think European Commission.  So in this way there are 39 full members in total and you will also find many affiliates here. What tools do they have?  Meaning they can blacklist these countries. Can be put in grey list.  Mutual evaluations are done by them. Country monitoring is done.  So they have a lot of power.  Well why does this matter so much ?  Why is this condemnation by FATF so important?  Let us understand this a little.  The first is diplomatic win for India.  No doubt.  Look, India has been campaigning for this for a long time and now you must have seen that India has sent delegations to every country, that is, to all the important countries. All party meetings, all party delegations were sent and somewhere in that, India was highlighting that Pakistan is trying to spread state sponsored terror network.  Meaning he does terror financing. Promotes terrorism.  Tries to spread terrorism in India directly or indirectly.  So this statement of FATF shows that this is a victory for India, diplomatic in a way.  And the statement of FAETF is, in some way, promoting India's claim. It is showing that the financial system in Pakistan is being misused to carry out cross-border terrorism and apart from this, India's argument to reintroduce Pakistan into FATF Grey List gets strengthened to some extent. Apart from this, what I was telling you here is that it is very rare that a particular incident is highlighted by FATF. Because this has happened only twice before. You can see that the Paris attack that happened in 2015 was carried out by ISIS. Apart from this, you will remember in 2021 when the US was withdrawing from Afghanistan.  So at the time of withdrawal, a big bombing takes place at Kabul airport. A lot of people have lost their lives.  I think we made videos on that and I remember at that time, probably the number was around 200-250. Many people were killed.  So only these two particular incidents have been highlighted till now. So the fact that the Pahalgam attack has been highlighted again shows that there is global concern about it and the threat level of terror is continuously increasing.  Then thirdly, there is another thing here that the statement of condemnation issued by FATF again focuses on terror funding and how to stop it.  So what will be FATF's future efforts?  Like Movement Across Digital Platforms.  Nowadays, the money movement that happens is transferred from here to there very easily on the digital platform. So how can we stop him ?  Then how can we stop the use of Hawala, Crypto currency, informal network etc. ?  International donors who may have no idea how they are funding extremist charities.  Because like you see, Jamaatuda Dawa, which is Hafiz Saeed's party, has formed its own religious front and it keeps getting a lot of donations etc. So there might be many people who give donations thinking that it will be useful for education.  It will be useful for health purposes. But actually his money is being misused.  So, somewhere or the other, this should also be stopped in some way.  So this is going to be the future effort of FATF. Well, what will be the impact here on Pakistan?  First of all, let me tell you that between 2018 and 2022, Pakistan was put in the grey list of FATF. And you can see in Pakistan, there were many shortcomings in the anti- money laundering and terror financing framework in Pakistan and that is why he was in it.  But what happens finally? In October 2022, a 34-point action plan was given to Pakistan.  You should fulfill all these things.  So keeping that in mind, it is withdrawn from somewhere. Meaning, Pakistan is removed from FATF's grey list. But let's say Pakistan is included in this list again, what will happen?  First of all, the entire financial funding from international finance like IMF, World Bank, ADB, Asian Development Bank will be cut.  Secondly, economic sensations can be triggered here. Different countries can also impose economic sanctions.  Then the third and the most important one is let me tell you because Pakistan has a habit of asking for money everywhere. So here, if he asks for the money and the interest that has to be paid on it will have to be paid more because of his credit rating, it falls and the credit rating falls means that earlier you were paying 12% interest on whatever money you borrowed, now you will have to pay 14%, 15%, so this is the impact, so going into the grey list means a very big blow to your economy and somewhere India wants that it should be put in the grey list and that is why, if you see, India has already submitted dossiers and intelligence to FATF, that is, FATF here and Asia Pacific Group and we have told this again that see how Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar are roaming freely in Pakistan.  That means you have said that they are UN designated terrorists.  Despite that, he is roaming around freely. What is going on?  So somewhere this was highlighted by India. Then look here, it is not just about FATF.  International reactions have come from several organizations.   The Parliamentary Forum of BRICS condemned this attack and focused on collective responsibility and how we should attack the financial backers of terror. Secondly, the member states of USAC also said here again that we will have to make the financial monitoring strict.  And the European Union agencies have once again given their support on how to stop virtual asset based terror financing.  Look, now the question that will come to all of your minds is when can Pakistan be put in the grey list ?  Let me tell you that the review of the Asia Pacific Group is going to be held on 25th of August. So what is there here, it means there are reviews of many countries like Pakistan, India etc.  So, India will try very hard to get Pakistan included in the FATF grey list and when will the decision be taken on this?  On the 20th of October.  Basically the FATF plenary meeting will be held in Paris.  The head quarters are there as you know.  So it will be decided there whether Pakistan will go into the grey list or not.  And at the end of this year, FATF's report on terror financing also comes out.  It shows how financial infrastructure has been attacked due to it in recent times. Well, the conclusion is that it is a turning point.  This means that the FATF condemnation has gone beyond being a regional terror incident to become an international compliance issue.  Meaning, this will put a lot of pressure on Pakistan's financial transparency and the eyes of the whole world will now be on Pakistan. And what's more, terrorism is no longer just a military security concern but it has become a financial concern as well.  This statement of FATF highlights this.  So let us see whether Pakistan goes into FATF's grey list or not.  But I hope that I have told you whatever the background was behind this. Before I go, can you tell me a very interesting question?
