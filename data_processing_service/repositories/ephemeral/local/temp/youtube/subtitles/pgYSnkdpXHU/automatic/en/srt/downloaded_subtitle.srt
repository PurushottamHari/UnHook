1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,960
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,280
Hello Friends.  Friends, will

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,040
Pakistan be put on FATF's grey

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
list once again?  I am

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,600
saying this because yesterday

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,000
a very rare statement was issued by the Financial Action Task Force.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,640
Meaning,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,879
FATF does not comment directly on any incident.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,360
But here FATF has

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,719
accepted India's point.  India's stand is

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,680
that yes,

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,559
terror funding is behind the terror attack in Pahalgam.  Meaning

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,800
this Pahalgam attack could not have happened without terror funding.

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,320
You can see this news.  FATF

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,560
Condemns Pahalgam Attack, Says It Couldn't Have Happened

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
Without Money.  So there is a

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
need to understand this in a little detail as to

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
what exactly is happening here.

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,600

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,600
What will be the impact of this statement of FATF and can Pakistan be

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,360
put in the grey list?

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
I will tell you everything in detail as to when this is possible.

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
Let's move on.  But

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
before that friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,799
preparing for UPSC,

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,640

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
want to take it in pure English, pure

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
Hindi or English, it is

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,640
available in all three languages.  You have to use

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,400
this code AnkitLive to get maximum

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,400
discount and you will get its link in the comment section.

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,240
Let's get started.

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
First of all, let me tell you that tomorrow there is

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,119
FATF Financial Action Task Force, which is the

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,680
most important body in the world that

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,600
monitors money laundering and terror financing.

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,600
He issued a rare public

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,240
condemnation for the 2 April Pahalgam

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,719
terror attack that took place in Jammu and Kashmir.

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,280
And this incident marks only the

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,079
third time in over a decade.

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,880
If you look at the last decade, this is only the third time that

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,200
FATF has highlighted a particular incident

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,039
and has

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,520
directly condemned this particular

57
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,599
terrorist attack and said that this is

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
very serious, meaning that somewhere

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,840
it is being shown by FATF

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
that we are taking this matter very seriously

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,440
and somewhere

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,760
you will also see its financial implications.

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,480
Well,

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,959
you all know about the terror attack that happened in Pahalgam on 2nd April in which 26

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,760
innocent civilians were killed

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,319
and definitely the Pakistan

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,640
based terror outfits behind this, be it Lashkar Taiba or

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,800
Jaish-e-Mohammed, you all

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
know that TRF was

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
brought to the fore here and TRF had

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,560
already accepted it, after that,

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
somewhere Pakistan played a trick and

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
started backing out through its own statement.  Well, whatever it

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,879
is, it is clearly visible here that

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,800
Pakistan had a hand in this.  So now the

76
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,280
question is why is this

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,120
statement of FATF so unpredictable

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,920
?  See here what FATF has

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,120
said?  Please understand this carefully.  True attacks could not happen

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,560
without money.  This attack which happened

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,680
in Pahalgam would not have been possible without money.

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,640
And the ability to move funds between

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,720
terrorist supporters.  Meaning, the way

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,519
money transactions are being done

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,159
between the terrorists, this

86
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,000
particular attack could not have been carried out without it.  So

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,560
this statement of FATF

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,200
implies that there is a direct financial

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,440
link with terror activity.  This shows

90
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,680
that organisational and cross border

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,760
facilitation is happening somewhere.

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,319
This is not an incident that happened in isolation.

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,799
Somewhere or the other things have come from across the border.  Only

94
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,280
then this particular

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,519
incident was created.  Well, this

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
statement shows that there is talk of

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,760
promoting global vigilance.  The

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,239
state actors and financial

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,720
institutions are being told to try to

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,200
stop such activities.

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
Otherwise this can create a lot of problems.

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,599
Well, when I

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,319
talk about FATF, keep in mind that FATF was

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,159
created in 1989 by G7 nations.

105
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,480
Now you already know that PM Modi has also gone

106
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,319
there and the G7 meeting is

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,239
going on in Canada.  So

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,840
it was established by him in 1989.

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
Keep in mind that

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
from your exam perspective its headquarter will be in Paris, France.

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,639
What is its main focus

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,880
?  Basically,

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,520
how to combat money laundering?

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,320
Whatever

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,240
international standards have to be set related to terror financing, they are done

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,720
by them.  Well,

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,080
how many members does it have?  Keep in mind there are 39 full members.  Out

118
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,320
of 39, there are basically 37 countries and

119
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,120
two organizations.  Organisations like

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,000
GCC Gulf Cooperation Council and one of

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,479
yours I think European Commission.  So in this way there are

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,080
39 full members in total and

123
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,000
you will also find many affiliates here.

124
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,919
What tools do they have?  Meaning they

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,919
can blacklist these countries.

126
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,919
Can be put in grey list.  Mutual

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,400
evaluations are done by them.

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,720
Country monitoring is done.  So

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,960
they have a lot of power.  Well why does this matter so much

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,440
?  Why is

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
this condemnation by FATF so

132
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,360
important?  Let us understand this a little.  The

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,080
first is diplomatic win

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,320
for India.  No doubt.  Look, India has been campaigning for this for a long time

135
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,960
and now you must have seen that

136
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,960
India has sent delegations to every country, that is, to all the

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
important countries.

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,360
All party meetings, all

139
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,440
party delegations were sent

140
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
and somewhere in that,

141
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,280
India was highlighting that Pakistan is

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,759

143
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,759
trying to spread state sponsored terror network.  Meaning he

144
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,160
does terror financing.

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,919
Promotes terrorism.  Tries to spread terrorism in India

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,720
directly or

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,800
indirectly.  So this

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,720
statement of FATF shows that this

149
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,120
is a victory for India, diplomatic in a way.  And the

150
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,600
statement of FAETF is, in some way, promoting India's

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
claim.

152
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
It is showing that the

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,080
financial system in Pakistan is being

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,320
misused to

155
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,639
carry out cross-border terrorism and

156
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,440
apart from this, India's argument to

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,919
reintroduce Pakistan into FATF Grey

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
List gets strengthened to some extent.

159
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,319
Apart from this, what I was telling you here is that it is

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,240
very rare that

161
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
a particular incident is highlighted by FATF.

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,479
Because this has happened only twice before.

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,120
You can see that the

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,520
Paris attack that happened in 2015 was carried out by ISIS.

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,199
Apart from this, you will remember in 2021

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,840
when the US was withdrawing

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
from Afghanistan.  So at the time of withdrawal,

168
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
a big bombing takes place at Kabul airport.

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
A lot of people have lost their lives.  I

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,080
think we made videos on that and

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,319
I remember at that time, probably the number was around 200-250.

172
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Many people were killed.  So only these

173
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,560
two particular incidents have been highlighted till now.

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,800
So the fact that the Pahalgam attack has been

175
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,280
highlighted again

176
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,160
shows that there is global concern about it

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,479
and the threat level of terror is continuously

178
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,360
increasing.  Then thirdly, there is another

179
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,000
thing here that the statement of condemnation issued by

180
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,319
FATF again focuses on

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,360
terror funding and how to stop it.  So

182
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,599
what will be FATF's future efforts?  Like

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,039
Movement Across Digital Platforms.  Nowadays, the

184
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,199
money movement that happens is transferred from

185
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,880
here to there very easily on the digital platform.

186
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,960
So how can we stop him

187
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,520
?  Then how can we stop the use of Hawala, Crypto

188
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,319
currency, informal network etc.

189
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,360
?  International donors who

190
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,680
may have no idea how they are

191
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,720
funding extremist charities.  Because like

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,199
you see, Jamaatuda Dawa, which is Hafiz Saeed's party, has

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,520
formed its own religious front

194
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,840
and it keeps getting a lot of donations etc.

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
So there might be many people who

196
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,199
give donations thinking that it will be

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,280
useful for education.  It will be useful for health purposes.

198
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,599
But actually his money is being

199
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,520
misused.  So, somewhere or the

200
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,000
other, this should also be stopped in some way.  So

201
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,400
this is going to be the future effort of FATF.

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
Well, what will be the impact here on

203
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,440
Pakistan?  First of all, let me tell you that

204
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,759
between 2018 and 2022, Pakistan was

205
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,400
put in the grey list of FATF.

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,479
And you can see in Pakistan, there were many shortcomings in the anti-

207
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,800
money laundering and terror financing

208
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,560
framework in

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,879
Pakistan and that is why he was

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,400
in it.  But what happens finally?

211
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,240
In October 2022, a 34-point action plan was

212
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,160
given to Pakistan.  You should fulfill all these

213
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,919
things.  So keeping

214
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
that in mind, it is withdrawn from somewhere.

215
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,560
Meaning, Pakistan is removed from FATF's grey list.

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,039

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,280
But let's say Pakistan is

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,759
included in this list again, what will happen?  First of all, the

219
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,240

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,440

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
entire financial

222
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,159
funding from international finance like IMF, World Bank, ADB, Asian Development Bank will be cut.  Secondly,

223
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,000
economic sensations can be triggered here.

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,320
Different countries

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
can also impose economic sanctions.  Then the third and the

226
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,000
most important one is let me tell you because

227
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
Pakistan has a habit of asking for money everywhere.

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,880
So here, if he

229
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,120
asks for the money and the interest that has to be paid on it will have to be

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,959
paid more

231
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,120
because of his credit rating,

232
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,080
it falls and the credit rating falls

233
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,080
means that earlier you were paying 12% interest on

234
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,519
whatever money you borrowed, now

235
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,920
you will have to pay 14%, 15%, so this is the impact, so

236
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,240
going into the grey list means

237
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,000
a very big blow to your economy

238
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,839
and somewhere India wants that it should be

239
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
put in the grey list and that is why, if you

240
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,480
see, India has already

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,959

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,200

243
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,519
submitted dossiers and intelligence to FATF, that is, FATF here and Asia Pacific Group and we have told this again that

244
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,920
see how Hafiz Saeed

245
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,240
and Masood Azhar are roaming freely in Pakistan.  That means

246
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,080
you have said that they are UN designated

247
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,920
terrorists.  Despite that, he is roaming around freely.

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
What is going on?  So

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
somewhere this was highlighted by India.

250
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
Then look here, it is not just about

251
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,160
FATF.  International

252
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
reactions have come from several organizations.   The

253
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,839
Parliamentary Forum of BRICS

254
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,839
condemned this attack and

255
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,720

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,920
focused on collective responsibility and how

257
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,240
we should attack the financial backers of terror.

258
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,200
Secondly, the

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,120
member states of USAC also

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,360
said here again that we will have to make the financial monitoring

261
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
strict.  And the

262
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,120
European Union agencies have once again

263
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
given their support on how to

264
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,720

265
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
stop virtual asset based terror financing.  Look, now the

266
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,279
question that will come to all of your minds is

267
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,600
when can Pakistan be put in the grey list

268
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,800
?  Let me tell you that the

269
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,720
review of the Asia Pacific Group is going to be held on 25th of August.

270
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,560
So what is there here, it means there are

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959

272
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,200
reviews of many countries like Pakistan, India etc.  So, India

273
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,120
will try very hard to get

274
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,519
Pakistan included in the FATF grey list

275
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,480
and when will the decision be taken on this?  On the 20th of

276
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,399
October.  Basically the FATF plenary

277
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,399
meeting will be held in Paris.  The head

278
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,320
quarters are there as you know.  So it will be

279
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,320
decided there whether Pakistan will

280
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,560
go into the grey list or not.  And at the end of this year,

281
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,959
FATF's report on terror financing

282
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
also comes out.  It

283
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,640
shows how financial

284
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,279
infrastructure has been attacked due to it in recent times.

285
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,200
Well, the conclusion is

286
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,320
that it is a turning point.  This means that the

287
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,720
FATF condemnation has gone

288
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,959
beyond being a regional terror incident to

289
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,959
become an international compliance issue.  Meaning, this will

290
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,200

291
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,200
put a lot of pressure on Pakistan's financial transparency and the

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,440
eyes of the whole world will now be on Pakistan.

293
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,760
And what's more, terrorism

294
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,399
is no longer just a military security

295
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,720
concern but it has become a financial concern as well.  This

296
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,640

297
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,399
statement of FATF highlights this.  So let us see whether

298
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,160
Pakistan goes into FATF's grey list or

299
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
not.  But I hope that I have

300
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,360
told you whatever the background was behind this.

301
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
Before I go, can

302
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
you tell me a very interesting question?  There

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
are two statements related to FATF.

304
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
Which one is correct?  And you all know its right answer.  You

305
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,519
