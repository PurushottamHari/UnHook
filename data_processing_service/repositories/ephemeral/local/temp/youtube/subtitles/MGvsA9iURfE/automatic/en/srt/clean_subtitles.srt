Dhruvail you would have played for India yes what was that feeling Is? Whenever I play an India match Even if I get out. so daddy so much Oh, no problem. when you look in tricolor If not, my chest would swell with pride Is. My papa was a constable. Quick Had to take voluntary retirement. Because Papa had a heart attack on duty. So he had to take up a job because of me. So he is someone's bodyguard so I told papa Literally I saw him opening the door. to papa I did not tell you but I came home and felt a little When he cried, I said he wanted a kit bag but he refused Did it. Then Mummy told him to sleep Sell ​​the chain and get a kit bag for it. I had promised mommy, mommy no also my earning will come first to you I will tell you that gold I will get it for you.

I always visualized that I am a BCI I am watching TV on Virat Bhai's side My name is written in it. and exactly the same Happened. Sharing a dressing room. Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah. Common what is the thing? This is what it feels like in the Indian team Talk to some senior, I don't think so That friend you are talking to a senior. He explains the meaning in such a way that we too are at this stage But I was like you. something happened to me Personally. so I go into flashback Yes, I saw this on TV. Every cricketer Dhoni Why can't it be done? I had said that Bhaiya how are you so comfortable? They He said, if you work so hard, you will win 10 matches I will do that twice. This is MS Dhoni's M S Dhoni in the position he used to bat In that position I do it and its Hard because in australia in england Cricket is just a support for them but for As no, this is our religion, we are leaving Our deeds go by touching the ground with our feet movie I won't say much Dhruv Judel I will just say about them that I I am a fan of mentality, but this person's mentality I am not the only fan of . even if it Be it Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Suresh fan I have spoken to countless senior cricketers I have talked about these. Everybody Pole Talks about Judel's mentality Is. And in the long term the world of cricket Mentality is what matters the most Because everyone works hard. this is an IPL special. On It's a Cricket Special Morally it's a mentality special we Mamba Mentality Monster Dhruv Jude and D R [music] S pole root looks great that you Be in the studio. thank you for having me Or not I am having love with you friend. on my mind There was a conflict going on as to whether I should do this Should I say it in the end or in the beginning? In the end I will tell you something after knowing you a little. But in the beginning I would like to say that I have Watch cricket for my entire life. and right now I don't know which young players I see the right attitude. that long ago I get to know from it. first of all thank you what are you Already done for the country. You played a solid innings in Test cricket In. A love watching in IPL as well. Honestly.

The seriousness that you have No, she looks good. showed seriousness gives it to your game. the whole world Class athletes are serious. A who He also played everything seriously for India There are. Some are more serious Like you. Thank you. Thank you. Agree? all of that I think that from my upbringing It comes. My father was in the army when I was a child I have learnt from this that meaning does not mean anything don't take this as a joke because everything It is serious. If you want to take yours If it is above me then whatever I do I give it my 100% And I give something like this fun I don't see that friend this is that because for me who knows that if he does not do well in the future If that happens then I will regret that thing I try to always give my 100% and I should be in full focus. for india when you What is that feeling when you are playing? It is very good and whenever it is from India I have played for it so it feels like that means I am representing India because As a child, I had a dream that I would do something in India I should do it for this and not for cricket already Was. I grew up watching my father. Papa is very There was discipline. My papa was a constable. So I think that I am in a higher rank I want to represent something for India. so i Wanted to do NDA till at least. then to me I felt that it wouldn't be possible, friend. I tried But I play street cricket a lot So I started playing. I Papa I have told him many times that Papa, I want to go to India So I have to do it but side by side I also want to play cricket. So dad said no because there is a mentality which is in the middle Class ki yaar cricket is a gamble because how many people are playing and very few There is a percentage who can reach that level. So That was the one my mom liked. He also refuses I used to do this because one of them was expensive it's a game and you are not sure that your The child will go to the team where he/she is It becomes stable and you start earning well If you go, it was always decided that you would join the government If I take a job then anything can happen to me It was like, okay, I am in Papa's line. I will go and do something for India I always thought I would do something for India what happened those were the days of summer camp Two-three friends decided that some Let's do it in this summer camp, everyone has decided did that swimming pool school classes Let's take it. I said okay let's go. So I was there where the forms were being filled out When I went to fill in the form I saw kids playing watch white race match yes playing cricket So he filled the swimming pool form. I have filled the cricket form and come back quietly and I came with them but wight I brought the kit. I borrowed ₹250 from my mom and a triple N white kit comes Was. I just had that on me, I had gloves on There was something there. I did this so that I could play cricket I started playing and my friends said brother you Where are you going? Brother, I saw you there He abused me and said you are a cheater This is it my friend, let me try it out no because I won't tell mom and dad I could have told them that Papa told us to take care of the swimming pool I have told you not to go in such deep water yes yes you will see it then I would have come I came and kept walking like this so mom when I told him that this is my white I play with my dress, it's dirty hey mummy will wash it then you said what is this dress made of I have done it just like that, he said swimming pool I don't understand this costume I secretly told this to my mother I cried a lot, I cried a lot that please let me play let me play play When he gave it to me, he agreed and told me to let's go ok, he agreed, then I told papa Papa Dila Bat When I gave it to him, he said, yes it would cost ₹200-₹300 Papa, I'll get you some of that I am not a tennis player, I play with a leather ball I am a professional so I need something good Professional to English, Philosopher to English I don't know if there is a Philo bat but there comes a Kashmir willow bat which let's start so I said papa that Give it to me, how much does it cost It was worth ₹850 ₹900 so dad was thinking It will cost Rs. 200-300 and my father at that time I had retired, the house also means loan etc. When it was moving, that table was not in that position If you could give me a bat worth 850 then I would Everyone cried and then he started playing well I had gone a little bit because whenever When I started playing, I only had a bat I used to borrow the next spade for someone Then it felt like friend, I also need my own How long will I keep asking for it, then I muster up the courage After making it he said to me baba kid back I asked if I wanted it but at first I refused, state You won't get it, I want to play with you If you don't want to play then come, his only solution was to leave Let cricket come back and use your brain again I don't know what habits he has acquired from his government job When I said that I have adopted it, he refused did I give it to you or not papa please give it to me Give it to me, I cried, everything happened in two-three days It's been 4 days and it's been going on like this, right? When I got it, I always went to my mommy go to mommy see talk to daddy Look, papa talked to mummy I also scolded him saying that you have spoiled it it has happened to you, if you don't correct it then I'm going to kill him, so I thought, now what should i do and i was dead Seriously, I want to play cricket only. because I was enjoying it so much and my I felt like I could do something From the first day I looked different Was. I felt that yes, these kids I am a little different from. When did we find out that Do you play well? It seems to me that It was initially known in a month when I used to play street cricket with him earlier Was. I used to play very well in that too. But What was the role? Batsman. batsman keeping did you do it? No. Ok. She also did the keeping It is an interesting story. I will tell you. So I started, I was batting and The medium page used to bowl. Wow! Yes. Because there was aggression and not a medium Have to insert page stage. going into the hollow through The meaning was like this. So I said kit bag. If I want it then I refuse, then I go to the bathroom I went and was taking a bath. I don't know what I It clicked. I'm talking while taking a shower if you don't get me my kit bag Then I'll leave the house and run away I will go. So papa said yes, you go. Papa told me to go away. by doing so that He knew that he wouldn't go. Mummy She took that thing a little seriously. Son is the same Is. And then what did mom do? Now their There was a gold chain. He gave it to papa. it take this sell it to this means kit for this Bring the bag. So that thing occurred to me at that time I did not realise it because I felt that Yes, it's okay, they are my parents. the work is We are doing our part. What happened? then like I have started earning, so I After one year I played under 14 states So some money came from there. So when to me Realization started when I told mom Was promised to. Mom, no one is the first My earnings will come to you, whatever you say, I will do that I will get you that gold. Because what our The UP type of families which are They get a lot of fascination from not sleeping that yes gold gold gold because everything we see it because mom and dad are not together Even when you go to a wedding someone judges you If you do then judge by your sleep that friend He is wearing gold so he is very rich So a mother has always had a Because mom and dad always struggled so much Papa has always supported mummy in life When I stayed with him as a housewife, this was my situation Now I will give you whatever you say I will get it for me when I get a good one in 14-16 I could not earn this much in just Rs. 1000 7-8000 per match when I was in Under 19 World Cup When I played cup, I got some good money I got a lot of gold for my mommy I bought only gold, take it mom I hugged Sir and sat down as if he Made my name famous and it means a lot He had tears of joy, I loved it a lot It felt good, even 14 crores was a lot People can buy more gold, should I tell the truth And brother, now I don't like that 14 crore ok but what you started with Earning, the earning that I had was a lot Now I have got 14 crores, it's okay. worked hard for it my parents whatever I have coaches who are there for everyone at the right time It's not mine alone but I feel This is what I earned in the beginning I had started doing it, which was a realization I am missing him so much right now that I love him so much Anyway, money doesn't make that much difference just want to do well for my country to bas So that's it, whatever you are to me Whosoever comes, I give it to papa Papa please I don't need anything, really I have literally given his account. that papa you look after it because I have no There is no fascination, it's okay with money, friend All I wanted was that I should not have to tell my We don't want to give a good life to our parents because He has struggled so much I am Sure everybody would do it, but I I have seen my parents struggle I have struggled so much that I can do whatever I want I still want her to be like that If there is mentality then the mother's legs will ache It happens that Papa is also getting older, so am I I am telling you to keep a caretaker. They She also refuses. What happened? I do I will take it. So why give money to anyone? He still has this mentality. because he He showered every penny on me I have fed him. I have taught my sister. So that one Seeing this thing I feel that my friend Papa Now I have started earning. Do it now, friend. But still they say that what will he do it? Money will be wasted. I will do it no This that. Then sometimes I get angry too Would. What am I earning and for whom? I am earning for you. So he right now I am explaining it to you but you don't understand. Is So, parents. But do they like this feeling? That his son is a great player? For them The best thing seems to be that the son is the country's is playing for. whenever i am in india I play the match even if I get out So. So hey, it doesn't matter. when you are the tricolor I can see my chest proudly It becomes wider. I had to tell you one thing after we met. We I have been following you for a long time Is. I don't know if I think you are missing me Is. yes yes yes it's been maybe two-three years Are. yes and when i saw your name retention This is all I had to do on the list. Really Happy I am genuinely happy from the heart. Aki who is sitting behind the camera. This too He is a big cricket fan. Your words I I have been doing this for a very long time. And Fortunately, many seniors came through the show Cricketers were also present. Everybody is your talks about mentality and It is said that connecting far will take you a long way. So it feels good, that means everybody praises it But what I told you in the beginning It's all about upbringing. like i mean it like that Behaviour is because of mom and dad because they They are also like this. and there is one and not some After achieving the achievement you are a little high You go away. But he is always grounded We keep it. So papa always says that B Be humble, be helpful, help everyone. so that's it It's a thing like that. So I am very into it I believe that if I do good to someone If I do, God is watching somewhere To me. And I am a great devotee of Bajrangbali I am a devotee since childhood. Hail Bajrang. Jai bajarangabalee. So there have been a lot of those. means to me It seems that who I am today is not my meaning Right because of parents, right because of coaches At the time I have seen that many Do cricketers live during the time of Bajrangbali? I don't know what power comes from them because my So this is where I had a ground Not from where I started playing cricket Spindle Cricket Academy who was the coach there Parvinder Yadav, he always comes to my house He lived near. So this was me, I am in the Army I used to study in school. so when the kids get out of school If I were going home, I would have attended school When I was going, I would meet them upside down So they asked you did you come to school because I He used to be the first guy who would immediately get a holiday He used to stand at the gate to give me time Don't waste 15 minutes by cycling I used to go to school or sorry home then there was a kit He was there after having food with bags etc. If I lived there then he would have made me sit on his bike He used to carry the kit bag in the middle while sitting on the bike I used to go there every Tuesday and our There is a temple of Bajrangbali there so I will go there I used to go and I still go because if If something of mine was going left or right then I go and apologize to them If something happened then forgive me, it means I am very attached to Bajrangbali since childhood You think about them even on the ground I think a lot and that gives me strength I feel that my parents and I are the ones Because when I go to the ground First I close my eyes and pray to my parents I think about what they Blessings have been given to the coach I think of Bajrangbali and I take a deep inhale. I double inhale So, I like it. I am a friend Where do I start with this podcast? with? I don't understand because Actually I want to talk to you a lot. Yes. Maybe let's start with one reel. Rihan when I was talking with you then your words Curry. Yes. Nobody wishes ill upon you. In the cricket world. and honestly the audience I would like to say this to. I am not saying this Dhruv bhai have been. This is what I am saying about cricket In this world people do evil to each other. Often I've never had anyone speak badly About you. Let's watch that reel once. What is Dhruv connected like? Dhruv is the The Hardest Guy Practices Who Likes the Like it's hard practice. it's not like It's not for the soft softies. it's like Hard practice. I see I tell you those Cramp things, right? that happens to him Almost every practice. He is like that. He He Just Feels Happy When He Works Hard. if he doesn't get runes he will work even harder like that just goes on Even this IPL he just kept on working hard and that's been going on for the last Two Years I Have Been With Him For The For the Last Two Years We Share Rooms We Do everything together and i have just seen him he is a fun guy he is a very fun guy of the in the field we go out hang together he loves his coffeera but then at practice he just like I said mama mentality or just get done Regardless Mama Mentality Mama If I tell you the truth, this is my mentality I didn't even know the meaning of this word, uncle Mentality is a series, last Dance is where all this fascination came from I saw it for the first time See wow, is there an approach like this as well Because in to be honest cricket this happens The approach is very less and many Viewers may not have seen The Last Dance Is. The Last Dance is about Michael Jordan. It's about Michael Jordan. Michael Consider Jordan as the Kohli brother of basketball Are. That's a good way to explain. So There's a documentary of their final season Where he made the team win. Butt Whole His life was told in the documentary And his mentality has been shown. Yes. So I saw that and it started. One episode in it is on Kobe Brain Is. I said it's such a big basketball is a player. He has an episode on it. What's in it? Then I told him about Read everything. Saw his documentaries. everything that he does for his speeches, podcasts, etc. Is. I said what is this guy? means his who The training schedule was that in the beginning He tells me that it is better to waste my time I don't think so. and i don't like to go on vacation because i don't want to regret it I did this, I could have done better. So that one why can't I become this thing that pleases me I have tried this a lot, To be honest, I am telling you this for the first time I also tried the schedule Kobi ka Kobi That I should sleep again for 2 hours at 4:00 in the morning it couldn't happen in cricket Then I realised that my friend Is it an indoor game or an outdoor game? It's difficult because you need wickets If you want it fresh and do it early in the morning then you Would not have been able to do it because there would have been a fresh wicket The one in which the sun shines is hard But there is so much moisture in the morning. You can't play. I think the main scene is It is about intention. Yes. no intention for Greatness. Intention to be the best version of Yourself. So it meant the same thing. I tried to try the same thing and It couldn't happen. But I felt that friend What else can I do better? to me It is not like that friend, they might be something else By doing this. So I realised one thing that You have to be consistent. whatever you are doing it is not that you did this or that because Sometimes People talk about motivation, there should be motivation Needed I don't think you are motivated You will be able to do much more. one day two days but It is discipline and not that brother this is your work. you have to do it regardless of what Have to do it. So I think that the thing Is good. and then you see in it that you How will you enjoy that thing? Now that's you Find that friend I'm going to the gym. Go Is. It's not like I have to go Is. I have to enjoy. Ok? Give motivation After that if I do this then this is my It will be beneficial. If I do this then it will be beneficial And your family's life will be better after going back So it seems like everything is about you If you are connected then you will do a lot of The life of the sons will become better who I have worked hard for you so you cheat on yourself he is doing it ok but don't cheat them Brother, this is Indian Mamba. Mamba desi Mamba desi Mamba who is desi Apart from you in the world of Mamba cricket I think Mahi bro Mahi bhai means whatever he has done for India For Unbelievable because to be honest with that The position in which he used to bat I do it and it's hard because you don't know where you're going There are three-four overs left. you can't take I have to kill it as soon as the time passes. strike rate Have to keep it well. The team needs it. thats Why he is great. He did it and Have done it repeatedly. So it seems to me that Mahi bhai means I respect him a lot Am. Whenever I meet them, I mean to I just keep watching. So if I mean them He achieved so much, he did not even achieve 1% If I do it then I will be very grateful. His Do you study games? Yes. Because all One of his game is that he has a lot of self belief Is. In what situation did his reading come and They have such self-belief that sometimes it seems That the situation demands 101 runs I want it in one over but whenever he plays single or double We are playing. They know that if I If he takes me deep inside then I will do it. I I will do it. And not many people have this belief It is not that I am not my friend, if I could not be my friend It couldn't happen. it is not in them, they do and always means 80-90% of the time they If we win matches because of him then I It seems that every cricketer is like a legend Why can't he become Dhoni? According to you I mean, I feel that becoming Dhoni is so It is not easy Because Dhoni sir has shown everyone that Skill means nothing but their There is mind and sharpness. the biggest thing i Whoever feels like saying something about his mother and brother no because it is very easy for me to say it too that be in the present think about it But they show it by doing it, they say it Trust the process, they prove it Friend I will think about it and rest will take care of itself like this But as a cricketer, I am telling you It's so hard to stay in the present Sometimes what happens is that you move ahead Do you ever go backwards during an edge of a match? this also happens because everything depends on you you are doing calculations aren't you my friend It has to be done, it has to be done. so a lot of things Sometimes we forget to do simple things my. Hum That's Why He Is The Greatest That They do that thing. what we say is not He has shown it by doing the thing. these lowers Let's talk a little about the middle order. Yes Yes, I do. you said it's a very Difficult position. ya na as a fan Obviously it is understood that the friend is aggressive Batting has to be done immediately. Are we right? Meaning This series did not take much time. Is this a very difficult factor for him? there is a difficult factor and that is because when you When you go to the wicket you don't know that How is the ball coming from the wicket? You don't have this Know what variation the bowler is doing and when what can you do and when you are batting at the top if it is normal then they put normal good length short ball this is when you go They also know that he is here to slog Trying to bowl wide of the crease Are. If there is a slow run ball then it is one type of ball We don't get that rhythm. One happens to be get rhythm that the same ball is coming 140 145 140 145 now what happens when we go Somebody wide of the cage yorker then We can also predict different balls I can't figure out what's going to happen Because when I talked to Dhoni So I said, brother you are so how can you be comfortable because I am very I was curious that you did it many times He always said that you just be in The Present Ball Dekh Just React And Wo Jab It will come when you practice. We are now what happens in practice is that we yes we will take time because there is exit Not there. Now he practices by putting pressure Do that friend, these shots are my option This is a field, so if you work hard If he does it then it will happen twice in 10 matches. This much It is less. That thing will be 100% 20%. These MS Dhoni is saying. MS Dhoni and himself I was telling you to watch my matches so that I How much do I do? But when I do it, it's the same There is enough and very few people do this. you can name them, you will easily remember that Who is it. That's why we are the greatest. So I mean, I think a lot of There are players who hit 100, hit 200 Are. But the impact that they have Meaning the hardest position he took Kankar has done it, that's why he is the legend. They This could be a game changing position. 100% yes It is a complete game changing position and very hard is also there. That's why he does it very easily. So I feel that whenever I too get something If so, I watch their videos and Whenever I get time, I talk to them. Am. A This is a strange question. I don't you know If that's the right question to ask. We butt ourselves What is your career projection for ? Meaning, what do you want to do in your career? This way Have you thought of something for yourself? I like the boss very much Keeping it simple means not thinking too much because I can't predict tomorrow therefore and whenever you predict yes, I personally feel that it is it is a human tendency that whenever you think about something Yes, we think negatively first of all. so it's the same thing so if I have some Even if it happens then why not positive? I will think about it, we will see if it doesn't happen So I am okay so acceptance is there that I would do the same in cricket too if I play this is my plan if could not accept that now what happens you got out, you went out after making a plan Once done, they tell you to do this he would have done it why would he have done it you are I'm sure I have to do this, I couldn't do it I will do it again, who knows there is something in the plan I will come again and have had the experience Now if I do something then it means to myself Doesn't it demotivate me at all, friend? It's done friend it's out it's okay this thing I have learnt from Virat bhai and Rohit bhaiya I have learnt it because whenever he gets out he comes He is smiling and making everything normal it is not like this and what would have happened to us Because I've just turned one year old Butt first for India while playing cricket I used to get out and I used to coach myself a lot that Friend, oh friend, what happened to this butt to him? Look friend, now it has gone out i.e. part end it's a parcel of the game and I think Whatever success you get, it is not like that How hard you work, how loyal you are Having the right things at the right time is very important Importent You can expect legendary players in the test team You are playing together. Sharing a dressing room. Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jaspreet Bumrah. we are with such people when you If you share a dressing room then what type of dressing room? Do you get mentorship? mentorship whatever Do it, there is learning in that thing. means that Everyone has seen what he does on the field We do. But the things that happen off the field They have made preparations regarding every thing. Like there is a bag. How do you keep KidBack yes. I mean those little things that you How much do you give? How much does the bat care about him You keep it with me. like bumrah bhai Are. I am a big fan of Bumrah. Since I have shared a dressing room with him. He is a legend. i.e. those things too We do it, right? Whenever something happens I I talk to them like this. So whatever that When we talk it feels like friend No legend is talking. one of mine is big Brother is talking. so it feels so good Is. I mean, just yesterday those Nav Awards When we met we were talking a lot I liked it. I mean it is like that there should be a perspective that when If you had not met him, how would he be? Off the way but Virat bhai Rohit bhai Bumrah Brother you are very chill, you are very helpful sometimes You can also go and talk about anything, will you? Answer you abhi his vibe is different from hardik bhai like literally means Rohit bhai Virat Bhai and Bumrah bhai are absolutely normal and sincere It means different if Hardik Pandya brother if Whether you are in that room or not, the vibe of that room is different yes really the way he talks his energy na makes the whole room feel that yes Hardik Pandya is a lion in our room yes so really i mean these things in these To learn a lot from small things If I get it, then it means I will try to I will learn anything from anyone I meet I just want to learn something from Hardik Pandya I always call him mentality monster 100% it means that mentality has been formed I have seen a lot because of the struggle He has seen a lot because he never Even now I talk to him a lot, He always says that I have improved a lot over the years it looks like that How much did he improve himself? Hmm and we are still improving So like playing a match means it feels like Someone is going we do match batting I go bowling and I'm always 100% 200% I mean it looks like they proved it does that mean anything dude if you think that You're gonna do it, you'll do it. what is it to you It seems that the public is not sure about Hardik Pandya What don’t I know? I think he is very very humble very caring helping means still i When he came he said that DJ only calls me DJ that no one will ever have any problem with you yes, tell me. so that means this is the thing It is not that I will call you tomorrow, brother. But I felt good inside that friend Hardik Pandya told me this. hmm so the same thing means it is very Helping to keep up with him when he's bowling They are doing it. What is that feeling? Because we don't know Hardik Pandya as a finisher Let's talk a lot about. I am a tomorrow stat was reading ben strokes and these Comparison was being made. by sports kid Had put it. Hardik Pandya scored more Wickets taken in ODI age compared to Ben Strokes. Why don't we talk Was his bowling like this? I think that everyone has accepted it I have accepted that he does it. means I you See if they play a T20 match sometime. Batting If there is no batting then there is bowling If he is not bowling then he definitely bats. He gives all-round performance. thats Why he is the MVP. What Impact We Make Is? That is what I am telling you. At number six if you are batting then if you are Scoring 50 and with a good strike rate you Be a different player, not everyone can do that. Because accessing as you go and automatically have belief because if you are taking time is same dhoni bhai same if you are It is taking time otherwise you will have to give it to everyone I know that this guy is very confident Because if you get out then 15 balls 15 Everyone will ask what is he playing but those 15 balls I know that yes it's okay Now I will take time in the last over If I hit two-three sixes then he will believe it It is also very important. this is the main factor It happens. This is the main factor. we believe Maybe among all the West Indies players this is also the main factor at that part Off the batting order like Andre Russell Pollard Dwayne Bravo is his self believe If I get the first ball I will hit it by doing this one but that is one Self belief is based on calculation Friend, I will take my time to play such a game and I'm gonna drive it like this one happens The game which runs itself, I will run the game like this I am the same thing Hardik Pandya And Dhoni bhai, Rinku Singh is among them He has the belief that I will play like this I will do this again in the last, this one thing is one layer deeper, okay I have this belief because of practice because of practice And this is the reason for doing this over and over period I've done that many times you know what is it because practice i know is good Everyone does this to hone their skills you upgrade yours but what you need the idea comes from maths, if you If you do it once, you get a feeling that yes brother i did it like this good Is. I can do it in the next match also. So This confidence comes from matches. Rayna Brother Recently I shot a video with We. We have a new series called Taaqat Jahan There is talk about mental strength. Yes. And While talking about that same mental strength Your name has come up. Ok. so he said that he made you captain in UP Was. Yes. And he said kudos to him Because he brought T20 style batting He is in his game. Yes. With hard work. Yes. A Basically your batting will increase further It has become aggressive for the sake of T20. We a how did you do this journey from where you were to where you are and could you even more Try to bat more aggressively Are you doing it and if yes then how? i you Let me tell you how I pick in IPL Happened. So If there are trials then I have a friend I mean we played under 142 karthik Tyagi. Ok. Ok. So I told him friend Look at me friend, if there are any trials if I get it for that then he talked to me then that Time I was not playing state. So my I did not even have any motivation, friend. Where was mine? Will be from? Even I am not playing state. What was your age? My age will be 21. Ok. 21 After the World Cup Under 19 World cup. So a lot of mean boys were picked up Ravi Bishnoi, Yashasvi Jaiswal. so to me I felt that I also want to play IPL But friend, it was not picked up. then a little one Motivation goes down. talk to dad You always kept it. but sometimes Overthinking also occurs. was 21 years old I haven't played that much cricket. used to work hard But I am not able to find that platform Was. So I said to Karthik friend please Look, he is my good friend. So he said that time he was playing war RR. So he called the video analyst He said that Sir, it is a boy. So I said let's go for details Send it. So he sent it. She completely Properly written sir that is the one of the best wicket keeper right now he has all the clips send etc because we played under 19 together world cup he sent everything so how he No, how did you agree then I will go there for trials I reached RR and I was not there Motivated to be honest because I wasn't I didn't even feel like going to the playing state no i am going away what happened So then I was nervous that whatever this is I gave everything to that day, friend From here we have to do this, that and so many people come keep I played the first round and it was [ __ ] very [ __ ] round eye plaid like very useless There was batting then I was like what is it okay friend i was packing my bag From there he was managing the nets etc. So he said that you have to bat again then I thought it was okay, I thought again I have come and seen that I will get my ball I will play naturally, like I play, I will not take any burden on me i will play freely So I went and shot shots and so on I have come with no expectations at all All. So when it was auction day I was not I am expecting that my match status is not there I am playing. The trial also went well. First Round It didn’t go well. So do this or give RR Picked I So I was like I was in tears. Mummy Papa called. Everyone was crying. I That means I cried too. I didn't know what happened? I mean, it was a very big day because I That day papa told me son you should join RR Picked up. ok but you didn't open everyone's mouth I stopped it because my dad did so much I have struggled but was not that well earned Papa's pension used to come because Papa's Papa also had to take early retirement Wantri because papa's on duty heart When I had an attack, I used to get pension from my pension Everything was going on, does papa know what Papa used to live, I mean very good Meaning he used to say what should happen to cricket It won't be done, does that mean you always kept it easy? Cricket is done, I will not become a cricketer What if it doesn't work out? You got a job somewhere My papers will get me my father in the army If I was there then I would have been one and not on paper You will become good at physical cricket If he plays, he will become good in physical too If you are physically good then you can also do that There is a recruitment for those who come as a soldier If you take it out, something will be alright If there is no tension then my father says cricket You play and this will keep you away from dirty things This groupism will remain and all this some of this whatever after school college etc you will stay away from him, you will focus better I will see when I get picked up Papa told me while crying that you Shut everyone's mouth. feeling good today yes I am feeling proud that my brother You made my chest broad, so I felt very good really So I went there for the first time as a Rajasthan Royals player feels so good When I got the T-shirt this happened to me I felt good, I got a training t-shirt He has practiced a lot there and worked very hard I used to do legit a lot of hard work, now I'm done I won't leave you because you love me one by one Thoughts used to come to me that I wanted to live my old life I don't want to go where I'm struggling Am. This is the platform I have got. I will do my best. full hard work I will do it. So I worked very hard. Meaning You won't believe it. I work from 8-8:9 hrs. I batted once in a day. I completely loved it my friend I won't leave now. no matter what happen. So first year I didn't play any match. So And I am glad. I am very happy For it's because I didn't get a match. because That time I thought I was not ready. I saw what I got in one year What gets things going. I found out to What I need to do exactly. like what This is very fast cricket. you have to be very Bold Confident. And it is not the case that if you are not able to do it on that platform then You go home. Nothing. means like this it was not like that okay I'll give it to you I will give. because it was on me that on me There is no backing. I was not even Playing State Cricket. So back it up like this That he is a good player. This is whatever it is You have one or two chances, if you get them So. And you have to make them. So We had a good team. Now I said that now How will I get into the team? you have to be Extraordinary player. i think so that the right things happened at the right time To me. That setup is so good. It is there in Talegaon, a little away from Nagpur Ahead. So I went there and batted. There is only ground there. Second Season It was about to start. then our first match Was in Guwahati. So I prepare for that I started doing it. There was a match with Punjab King. I I am visualizing that this ball is coming to me They are putting it. Sam is putting Karan. Arshdeep He is putting it. what can i do this is So I started this three or four times. month in advance and 15 days before IPL We got a day camp in Guwahati. so i was batting for like se hours 8 Hours. I am going to do it I am going to do it Am. I had a ghost that I had to do something I have to do it, I have to do it. so that time impact Player Was Introduced. So if the normal playing 11 If it were so, I think I would play too I can't find it. But dad always says Impact 11 Impact whatever rule comes is yours I came here because that rule changed my life To be honest, I played my first match maybe maybe 28 balls 75 odds runs var required to me and hetty was playing then I went, I know I should tell you the truth It didn't feel like it was mine at all This is my debut match, I have to be honest to myself It seems like I belong here and this one matches I played because I Listening to the sound of the crowd at airports Was. Somebody is crying, somebody is screaming, Somebody is doing this. I am walking. I'm going in from the exact end. I put in my right foot and it went in. Crease I Played leg stickly. This is the whole as it is me I would visualize it completely. From there he threw the ball Used to be. So maybe in that match I will I probably hit 32, 33 not out in 15 balls There was and we lost that match ah with three more Four runs. So that one felt to me like friend came Belong here I worked so hard for myself I didn't feel it so much that IPL IPL IPL because I felt like man I I belong, I will do it from there My journey started then in that season Two-three more good innings came and then from there It was good that we played Ranji Trophy again I had opened that one, I am not a The opener butt was empty right there so this is mine Don't meet anywhere, what will happen there If you get out more than this then it was a good season for me then i picked up for india a Ah, there was a match in South Africa, I scored runs Against South Africa A then we have an inter It was a squad match in which all of us were from India A There was a Vs India match so he came from practice Before the first South Africa tour, there I batted very well, Rahul sir etc. were there and there was also an advantage that Rahul sir was with me in under 9, we If he saw it then then the India column then this then this I was speechless when my I saw the name I tested the player through Witch means she's always that baggy blue I have always thought that I used to visualize that I am watching BCI TV which is their The website is there in it with closed eyes that My name is written next to Virat Bhai's name and we are in the same squad that thing and Exactly that is what happened, I named it that Look, I called my dad at 10 in the night. It is 11:00 o'clock. papa i got If I am selected then which team would I say? I Papa India, you are playing. that i was Playing India only. I told you papa Virat bhai Rohit bhaiya's team. He said, tell me the truth. I Yes Papa Khush could not sleep the whole night. These Then I went there and started two I did not play the match. Hmm. then i am third I made my debut in the match in Rajkot. So before that we were sent home because There was probably a gap of 89 days so I went I called Zubinder, Sir please do something please do it, I want to bat in the cam I have to bat a lot if I get a chance I won't let you go like this I have to do batting, you want believe me i played it back in the day 140 overs and 90 were played on the second day overs it was whoop na it felt like that too Where is that strain above strain 21 It does not show that there was 21 strains and recovery The next day she was 3% of mine But to tell you the truth, I was not able to get up when he I think we are not legit after 140 overs I picked myself up and was motivating myself Come on son, this is the chance you are going to get Nobody gets it just like that You will play in a population of billions Do this and that, son, you will have to do it for yourself For parents and coaches who provide support If I had to do it for everyone then I went I played that over for the first time entrance was bowling means that first run At the end of my life, I left it So I absolutely loved it. I said ok if he plays then I will be in that match I got out on 46 but I kept it well Another good catch made by run out in wicket-keeping etc. stumping etc. in the next match Again Dhoni also played in Ranchi Everybody was chanting there because This is Dhoni's home ground, Dhoni is not even two were there but it felt so good I mean how much fame he earned and I I am playing there and as an Indian If I am playing the player then that match and I Got Man of the Match remember this so I think that The whole of India took good notice of you today did yes that day but when you were such a strong When you are playing a Test innings you know that The whole of India is watching this I don't know about India, but it is true that in my Parents are watching at home and are very proud Yes, I was just that friend for my country I am doing something And I mean I am doing Indian jersey so I felt very good. means when man of the match if i got it then Happy for you. Thank you. Just that and this This is not the end of the podcast, of course. but this I would like to say that this is just the beginning. or 100% you said recently that you have UP It has also been opened for. Yes. this lower middle Batting up the order and opening skills Are the sets similar or very different? Both They are different. because if you are an opener you I have to look for a new ball. if that poor person If we talk about the red ball then it is for us Let's make an old ball so that we can play Because it is the skill set, not that There is open ball swing. There is a seam. He goes and plays on a fresh wicket. We know when our batting comes The ball isn't doing that much. This one This is the situation. and in the wide ball in the wide ball you have to hit with the first ball because you Can't take time. you play in power play If the fielder is behind then it's a right time to take on so that thing is a There are different skill sets but Both are very important to win the match For us, in my heart, you are through with your career You are moulding yourself as a batsman For the middle order we will ask you to tell me I think there is no such certain position It doesn't happen to me what I feel if Will someone tell me that I have to open your house tomorrow? Because we are playing professional cricket If your team needs this and I can deliver it so why not i am i am happy happy to do it for my team so What will happen, at the most I will sing out But I have it in me that if I get set I will try to make the team win and I How can I imagine how my team will be now? If we win then it's always been like a team goal not my like individual goal that I this I should do whatever I want, I just need a team Because that feeling after making the team win No, there is nothing unmatched if you hit 100, 200 Hit me, if the team loses then it's not me, we are the same That's the same mentality I've been taught in the NBA. You might not remember that Michael Jordan How many points is this? Butt rings you must know How many rings are there? That too the address of the brands How many rings would you have? So that championship A team that thing. Your mom and dad never Let's talk to you about cricket. Actually mommy doesn't have that much knowledge About cricket. Now you know the catch What happens? out what is that small basic basic thing so the same thing means His belief is that if I am happy, he is happy If I get out then mom Like my mom and dad, I mean every week I mean, I stay in Agra on weekends. Papam means we have everything in the village as well as in Agra So he always goes to Mathura because It is nearby and by going to Banke Bihari Because from there when I was making my debut no then rahul sir told me that you can ask Your father to come and hand over the cap to you Say that your debut cap is the one you will hand I handed it over to you so I called Papa When I did, my father told me to make my debut I am going to Banke Bihari what did you mean by that one Spiritual that yes he should go and put his hands on you What he meant was that you will place your hand on me If he does well in his debut then it means that he will I liked it, didn't I mean it was very grounded, these are the same things that I mean it feels good that it is very simple it is variant and it does not mean that Even if you have started earning well now It does not mean that the son should do this or that. Give simple life very good absolutely the best talk to me this way because your father is your Have you been a coach before in life? Yes, no, a lot Do you have a lot of connections? I wonder what they must be feeling about all this whatever is happening in your life He is very happy, to tell you the truth, he always When we talked earlier it seemed a bit like that yes okay there is something because back Our neighbors etc. remain off the mind, right? Actually I am a Jat so she is from that community There are many things, what kind of society do we have? But ever since I played for India means it stays in very wide area, yes my son my son means that thing No, I mean I like that my Papa had told me that look at your son, he is a father but the father is known by the name of the son If that day is not known by name then it will be the pride of the heart It happens that look Dhruv's father is going My father, don't say such things to me It happens on its own that papa yaar such things don't do this don't make me so big Whatever I am, I am here because of you how am I feeling i feel very good Is I mean, whenever I come into the room, then my I have a routine that I come to the room and lie on the bed I sleep, I just thank God for everything i will not ask that friend to me Give me this, give me that, whatever you've given me a lot I will keep working hard with a true heart give me whatever you have to give me as soon as you There are two. I am very happy because I have Now I feel at that stage, I don't think about myself that much Am. I think about my parents. whenever little things happen Because they have struggled so much Like papa mummy's age is almost around 60 It's done. He spent at least 50 years of it So, I have come out of this struggle. go now when I played Under-19 with Papa, Papa He was there, he was a deputy. So I paid that. So papa also says son for whole life I was in debt. whole life means everyone This kind of namaste from someone is really very I did this because when I used to play cricket Papa when there was pension, papa when there was no work I used to do this so my father had to take up a job Because the expenses are not being met. So Papa opens the gate in a municipal corporation Papa had a pistol because he was in the army So papa one license is for someone I was a bodyguard, so whenever I was from Delhi If anyone came back after playing a match or something, he would sit there I used to stay with Papa because Papa's When the duty was over we would go home on our bike We used to go there because it was a municipal corporation The stand was there and Papa's office was there, so I I saw my father literally opening the door I will tell you the truth about myself at that time. I mean I didn't tell my father but I came home I cried a little because I felt that Papa was there for me What are you doing? So to me it was that No friend, now papa means the one who He opens the door directly to everyone's father A message comes that Naimi Papa's name is Singh is Nemi you have done a lot of this My father had no idea what to do with such great men When I used to open their gate, I was getting their call If yes, then papa says that means he comes every day they mean it like this you know what i think 10 years Later we will not say that Nemi Uncle Dhruv Nemi uncle is doing something for brother Actually I was doing something for India. 100% he dedicated his whole life to India I have given it. I also saw his son. how does it feel dude All? think about it because Before the start of the podcast we went to Mumbai We were talking about glamour. I am Sure, you can find Bollywood stars. You know cricket is on top in our country Buddy. It is above Bollywood. cricket is religion then Meaning People Worship Cricket. from there to here How is your mind processing all this? I am not processing it. I told you that I have to take you along one day because Whenever you think ahead, you are a You think negatively that friend this happened, that happened Went. Is it okay? Whatever happens will be seen. Meaning There is acceptance, whatever happens will be seen. now one Establishment that life is good Is. Mom and Dad have had a good life. So now I don't want to think about that Financially, all this is good It is kept by the grace of God. now to me I have to concentrate only on cricket. Now he There isn't a side noise like this friend That, that, it's just cricket now. We are now that I think that those who are over the periods There has been a change. Now it's only cricket. Last For the last one year it's only cricket or not now I have to focus on cricket only. There is nothing. my cricket my parents And the one above. Not just wow, Dhoni bhai is also the same They say. Focus on this. everything else Will follow. Yes, that was what he said that if you focus on cricket everything is by Product Everything will come to you Fame Money and it is simple if you play well on yourself Sponsors will come and you will get a good contract If it happens then why not is the meaning behind that thing Don't run away, let him come, this is a simple thing That's why he was a legend and he is a legend that he showed simplicity and simply By doing simplicity over and over and over Because sometimes I get bored too is that friend no friend he is doing the same thing yes but it is very beneficial We mean to do it as difficult and boring as life Yes, the success will be that much higher It will be high, right, like you podcast. Your field is different, mine is cricket, whatever isn't it, it's around it, this is the thing I'm I won't do anything I won't have fun Friend, I should do this because of this thing thanks to you i am sitting here actually today If I do that with this thing, friend, it's okay it's not that i am scared of it I am telling you the truth, I am very scared I guess if I don't train well If I don't do this properly then I will feel guilty It stays there friend, today I did eight wraps in it Why weren't 10 raps written in the program? I think he should do this or not No friend, I am scared of the one above Friend, he is watching that, no one is seeing if he did this then I will always I'll try anything for this thing I will not let this harm cricket I have made one of my own. So, this thing Let there be harm. such mentality young Players don't always have it. You don't have to say anything. this is mine The world of cricket has observation. But I have seen that Hardik's Mentality is exactly like this. Yes. Peak Dhawan's mentality is exactly like this. Who it's your mentality and not like go far but Stay in the present, stay boring, routines Follow me. Growth mentality, right? Because all the legends that have been created are of sons This has been the mentality. because that's the thing No brother, it means that she is giving you everything Why do we have to have fun with this because in australia in england Cricket may be different and cricket is just a support for them but for us no one knows what This is our religion, this is our religion, we go Why do you go with your feet touching the ground? Brother, this is our land of work, we should go It means we are going to war brother We will go and worship him, our bats by kissing him completely, by doing it like this I keep it such that if my friend touches my foot then it will be just like this If you do it then it is the same thing and people will say is it friend no friend cricket is just a spot So why not do it like cricket? Cricket is not just yes Cricket is not just a sport and we live in india and we are Grateful that we live in India because BCCI one of the richest boat right if I I would have been playing cricket somewhere else I don't have all the opportunities here But population is very difficult in India to play. If you get there, you're settled For the rest of your life. so we are fortunate that we are under BCCI maybe Three-four generations are also settled. his address No, I did not think that far ahead. no don't think Brother. No. want you to always be Dhruv 100%. among young cricketers Sometimes financial matters arise Investments Savings or Even One Layer Deeper here basically we are talking about discipline We are disciplined, such things happen A lot happens, a lot happens, everything happens together Let's talk about where to invest real estate these these these these things no, even if it is a little distracting I have given everything to my father, My money also comes from my father's account I have given it. Meaning, it is my account. Father I have given it to. Papa, do whatever you want. And I have an account. So what I am in I do what I do. First this is mine When I had no money I thought this was it Dude lewthon bag rx watch. then his Later I realised that this is all It is a materialistic thing. I gave you this myself But I have noticed that after 15-20 days the same thing happens She doesn't excite you that much. So I have started recently. I'm somewhere I go for a walk carrying his memories with me I am coming. culture food everything wow we are showing experiences experiences when you If you were in your 70s or 80s, what would you say? that friend what do you call my old age Sold my youth in order to buy it. So that is the thing that I enjoy myself. I would do it and I would not have enjoyed it, Louis Whitten bag this that that you are not enjoying any And he is enjoying Luthon's bag, this is him If you want to be in that thing then I am Sure you have to do it but you should do it yourself The realization that my friend, I have done something I have brought some memories and anytime you You're sitting there wondering if you know what that person is That thing which excites happened there isn't there nothing around it because you You live in India and your culture is Indian It's different, if you go somewhere else the culture there is different Then you would enjoy learning something new For. It's the biggest lesson that you get out of Should go for a trip. lots of things how to Deal with different types of people and their food. It may never feel good but when you try it why is that so? Ask about them. So That thing looks really nice. that all of these Bag watches are not a tool for healing wounds Is. Yes. Whatever that is in childhood, yes. Injuries My heart said yes. She fills them up butt 15 really over in the day because a one Incidentally, when I needed an iPhone it was a 7 plus so when I I was playing cricket and I was in Noida I will tell you the situation as well Let me tell you how I reached Noida Played under 14 for UP so much in Agra There was no opportunity, it was already there playing well and if you want to improve If you want to do it then you have to do it with them who are playing there at a good level, You play well. because i am already Playing good among all. so where am I from Should I improve? I don't have anything like that that I look up to someone and try to become like him Have a desire for it. So I thought that man I will go to Noida. It was a very tough decision Be honest. So I made mom and dad how to do it. because papaam is on that stage I had understood that he would only play cricket. So I I told you papa's job was security The guard one. So papa used to come, mummy used to take care of everything Some. So what did Papa do then? to mommy no with me noida Sent food and drinks. And at that time I was Very happy. That's ok. You will get food. It's time. I will practice. at that time What would papa be doing? I think so. Now Who would cook the food? It was sister. didi's too There was coaching etc. Who would have made it? I How did you do it? And my mother stayed with me for two and a half hours Year. When I reached there the apartment The one I had taken was Gauss's. Gaus is a society was his. Why am I mentioning its name I will tell you about the Gars later. Gauss's Its rent was Rs 7000. It was a lot, friend. Truth Let me tell you, it was very difficult. how no how Did. Then I joined the academy there Noida Wonders. The coach there was Phool Sir. so I Started playing. I started There was also his fee for scoring runs etc. He hasn't charged me any fees till now Because I was playing well. They He supported me a lot. from there my The journey started. Then from there I again Revived, played Under 14 and then Under 16. Then Played Under 19. I had a break through season. Then I scored three centuries. then mine The name came in the series as a captain Asia Cup. So we won that Asia Cup. in the World Cup The name came up. And I was scoring runs. So My journey started from there. Then after that, Covid happened. all of us come back Fell. Then came back. Then from there IPL It was going on. So it wasn't closed. Dubai IPL was going on in that. so i don't pick It happened. I found it very strange because Friends, all those who were playing with me. and I And I was vice captain of the team under 19 World Cup. If I am not picked then to me It felt very strange, friend, what should I do? so I I was very much broken, what did that mean, friend I mean I have only one child and not the boys who are with me He is playing IPL and got a contract Everything is there so I thought what should I do friend I talked to papa and asked what happened to playing problem then there is state etc also in proper way I was not playing because if you are from UP There is a lot of competition where you are playing It's not about how good a player you are How soon does your time come? When do you get an opportunity, it is when you get it I didn't have that much So then when that trial thing happened then I The selection was done. then after covid I did not have to come back to Noida again. so for some reason I could not go to Phool Sir. then i Went to an academy. Divyansh is my friend Joshi. I asked him if he lives in Noida. Brother, I need an academy there. So There is an est public school. This is Afzal sir. Then From there I get the right guy at the right time. found. He was the coach. He helped a lot Curry. They searched my apartment etc. saw. Come on. So when I love him so much it wasn't that much worth the money because good I had earned it in under 9 so I am doing it Was. I was just taking care of it. So From there I started the journey again. So this is how my journey started from there Hui. Then came to Noida. Then that Gauss's I That's why I was telling you when he sold Gauss for Rs. 7000 It was the first apartment. my mommy did He said, wow, there are houses like this too. or two rooms One lobby, this one, and the other, on the 17th floor. Oh wow what did he say that there is a house like this That our little house in Agra never looked like this I haven't seen so many buses passing by or I saw on TV that there were apartments too There are sky scapes etc. taken there 7000 so Gus took Gauss's now he is back of the The bat is mine Gars wow and I am the brand ambassador of Gorse oh so that's the thing that means when Do you know where and how it is written it wouldn't happen hmm hm I miss my teenage days very much I have struggled because I never had to travel by auto Papa had an Active one and he paid on EMI She had sent it to me, I used to go by auto myself brother it is very good than etc. i mean I am I I am grateful that this happened to me and whatever I think he is playing at a higher level They all have stories. maybe if all that It would not have happened then you would have been worth 14 crores I am not able to handle the contract mentally. And if that hadn't happened, I would have thought He also gets a contract worth 14 crores No. I am a friend this is worth 14 crores There are talks of contract, right? I have come I don't believe this, I know that we RR has also done something in your mentality We have seen that they have talked about maintenance He also made some contribution hogi hum like there is a lot of belief around You are I am and now you have to know a little bit I am sure you believe that you are The pressure is not processing. For you There is no pressure. You might infact have strength It is available. It gives me strength. Right What is the environment of Tarar? because some So that must be the reason why Rihan Parag is so There has been a big bounce back. Jaiswal got so much Growth has been achieved. You get out of the RR setup. something is going very right which every We can't say no to a franchise. But This should definitely be the highlight for RR She goes. And RR has always been such a It has been a franchise that has always attracted youngsters It promotes. Still this time that splendor Picked up Suryavanshi. why are we in them something looks good but you have to be very Flexible so you can do whatever they say It will happen because he knows how to be a cricketer Is made. You go to 2013 and buy a 13 Year old cricketer's mindset when I started playing cricket wow yes and He would really get an IPL contract Meaning where is cricket going and meaning How much talent is there in cricket? It seems to him that Vaibhav is not feeling normal I mean we talked about it completely brother how are I good and this is normal and he is very good batsman like i have seen him It is like something, how are we Jaiswal, age A teammate? jaiswal and ryan ryan are my Like bestest friend. means whatever they Yes, it means that the three of us will tease each other They keep pulling everything. Jaiswal means the one who He is here today because of his hard work I still remember that we played under 19 World Cup Together. Then he would have batted like this I was really angry, friend, Why do you bat so much, friend? we too are I will bat. That means she knows that she came Want to do it. Then he has to do one more I will do it. When he gets out and works hard Is. Same with Ryan. People call Ryan a little I mean on social media they think that hey this It is like that. But he is such a genuine heart That person is me, I am my go to person Big. Meaning, whatever the matter is, we talk about it. humble caring helping means so good Meaning, his style of playing is different. He just plays with aggression. and it's ok When you are in the ground you will see your team If you want to win the match then you should show aggression Or show me anything if that helps you. if it is there then it's ok and you have to accept it even if he is not able to do it Doing for the team so I think that Ryan Jaiswal Sanju Bhaiya me and this Vaibhav if came We stayed grounded and thought good and did good I mean I practiced and everything is good If that remains, we will continue to give 100% RR for each of the three years. of cycle by winning championship in it I will give. We have played with Jaiswal before also when he Were you in UP? No, I did not play then. I Started with him from Under 19 itself. Yes. You Now it seems that the mentality of both of you is not the same To me. Like I feel like you both say Are cut from the same cloth. Meaning of DNA Beans It belongs to both of you. because he also has a lot of I remained struggling. Means there was a lot of struggle In his life too. So it is the same thing. I mean even if I get out Everything happens, I explain it to him. If he gets out, I will explain it to him Am. We are a mean pillar. Meaning Both of us were on Australia tour. both of us were talking to each other that friend you because if you are getting out then I Jaiswal seems like he did so well Is. I understood him, I always explained it to him Am. He explains to me that from one inning nothing is happening. Means you as a cricketer One innings is enough for us. We sometimes He goes immediately. But to ourselves we must You have to stand it up, friend, it doesn't matter This is the next chance. because we mean It is not the case that since childhood no one He told us that there are five to six chances of doing it. Give. Then it becomes easy, right? one on you There is a chance, I will have to do it. If you won't do it then no one And there is more. So that mentality is still with us Is. But we know that if we make one or two If the match is not good then we will have The surroundings are so good. They will back us. But our mentality doesn't go away Is. We feel that a match is going to be bad, friend We should not get dropped. we are totally negative They go away. so the same thing we Keep explaining to others. this is probably the answer It is a speciality of the state. of every place of every place because if you look at the population, 60-70% of its population plays cricket That too professionally and beyond that on the street Almost everyone plays cricket. You must also be playing cricket. so how not will be? Now tell me this Vaibhav Suryavanshi 13 years Would he have batted so well at the age of 13? So we This means a very competitive sport very much very much and you are very lucky yes if you are playing at a higher level you are very lucky your blessings are good You will always be loyal to your parents and God If you work hard then you will get everything If synchronization happens then you can proceed further yes sashasvi and you go for a walk together yes I will take him to Australia I will take him along with me. yes that means ever If you take me then we mean cafe cafe We really enjoy hopping. Coffee Coffee is ok so I would try it I live. This is very different We both have a good bond. what things Does it happen in cafes? Nothing in the cafes. Anything we talk about is normal. I I have told him this rule. Brother Cricket Please don't talk about it. yes know this Was. please don't talk about cricket because every time cricket cricket cricket Cricket you seem like a spark to me You forget it. There is a spark, isn't there one It feels like a good excitement that cricket Cricket starts to become boring that you Are you getting bored talking about this Are you doing this? Wake up tomorrow morning and pick up the bat again. If I have to bat then I think today We will talk about normal things and we have made a rule Brother, we will only talk about cricket No, we need to tune out like this. Yes is a must. You feel very fresh It is necessary because there is an excitement No, I am batting like you I scored runs today. Now go and bat tomorrow too I will do it, so I am pushing myself Am. I am not enjoying and enjoying It is very important in cricket. and Annie Sport or don't mind me asking. These It is a very long question but the beginning of the question I will do it from here. how far did you study Was? I have studied till 12th. And I have completed my first year of BA. I don't have time for the second year right now. I got it because you are thinking of some exam What about the exam? Yes. now to me You will have to give exams, right? It's not like this now It will happen automatically. Now get this much window I am not able to do it because IPL happens. Now I am an international because since I am an international Have you started playing, right? So it's time I can't find it. Hopefully no I will keep playing. I am shocked that you are thinking about studying had been. Yes. Yes. Wow. what is this feeling Is? Nothing. It feels good now that it's like this He said that he is 12th pass and 10th pass and one The graduate said that the graduate to me I have to do graduation and that's all I care about, friend You can also talk about life from the world of cricket You learn about it. very much, very much More. Human life, life is a sport. Meaning I mean the biggest beautiful coat I always I think. This too shall pass. if you make 100 had been. Tomorrow morning someone else will wake up and do 100. People will forget. And you are hitting zero. Tomorrow After hearing this you will get up and make it 100. People Zero You will forget it. So it means there is nothing like that. Life goes on, goes on, goes on. just that I don't think about life. taking it so seriously It isn't there at all. Be normal, be good, be the best Talk nicely. Just Hardik Krunal Both of them together told me one thing that Give me the feeling that a cricketer grows If definitely because of hard work we Discipline and those are all factors. Butt another This is a factor which is not talked about much. And That is growing outside of the world of Cricket also. 100% the people around you if you want to gain knowledge then this what is the link according to you because You are a growing cricketer, please explain this to me From your point of view, cricket is a good thing. It's a game we play, everybody knows everything You are playing cricket but outside Earlier you were talking about investing, so that is the someone is talking about this thing, meet someone did we go or did we go to some event, someone there But one good candidate of any specific field I found the guy, I talked to him and from there you grow because if you play good cricket na you will get good links that found a good doctor found a good lawyer or do we get any meaning from them to learn how this works friend That if you are keen to learn it doesn't mean that You should be interested, right? I can't tell you that friend, what kind of work are you doing? you do it, you should be interested and everyone Nor do we have a different way of looking at the world ask everybody what like let them talk and Who knows, something like this might click for you Help us, we are always happy with cricket The psychological game is also very much of its own If psychology is made strong then in cricket There are many benefits to you Meaning you don't have to be a neutral thing The day it goes away I feel that A lot of things become easier if you The performance didn't happen, you are just like this, right? So I think that it is a pause in life that yes it's ok it's ok means accept it yes okay yes what This happened and it does not mean that at the time of low Don't take so much at the time of high don't get high, stay cool and enjoy Meaning in IPL teams or Indian cricket Like the role of a psychologist in the team too It does stay there, right? Yes, it often gets kicked in when is their role meaning if the player's mental If his health is deteriorating then yes, Meaning everything is related to cricket performance performance we are getting It is not happening, then he feels that this is But then I think that's a good thing There should be a psychologist in the team, this or that, but you yourself you will become your own for me because you know that's what you're thinking if you You're a psychologist, no matter how much you You will not tell me, I will talk to you so openly I can't even find what I'm thinking because one fear is that the friend will Will you judge me and no one will accept this no i am transparent neither you You are your own best teacher You can make the resolution by talking to yourself You can resolve that thing? so to me it seems that the same thing is that you take your Time. No one is telling me to do this or that do it. If you are my best friend and me You are my guardian. So I will talk to From you. That area should not be small. Whatever I feel. inner circle. inner circle It should be very small. if as big as If it goes away it will be that much sad. Your inner circle is in cricket only. No I have two friends - my mom and dad. One is a touch, one is Shivam and one is a part and Whenever Rinku Bhaiya etc. but most of the time i talk to my friend sparsh then that Me to him because we have been together since childhood. Sparsh and Shivam have been together since childhood. like me I would probably say 10-11 years because it's very All things happen. you from your parents I am not able to talk. and its not that you do I can't do it. you can but you're older now You are done. He makes Papa and Mummy so sad I don't want to do it because it is somewhat emotional Things happen brother, this is not happening friend He will abuse me once or twice. Now it's ok right What happened to that thing and some other things You have to talk to the parents. We I talked about Rinku bhaiya. yes we are flat Mets. Yes. yes we have one in greater noida We live together. still you yes still you Are you talking about cricketer Rinku Singh? Yes cricketer Rinku Singh wow why? Because we have to motivate each other. No, we practice at one place. Everything comes from Aligarh. I Come From Agra it is nearby. when i was young I used to come to see him and used to watch the Aligarh matches. Brother, I play a lot of class. What brother We have to bat like this if we stay together now means very genuine hearted person and Both of Bajrangbali are very beautiful The elder ones stay together, we do everything And the biggest thing is that everyone says no If you stay with Rinku Singh then you will be interested in cricket Things will happen, I will try that too Neither that guy nor I, I said brother I What can I do for myself in cricket? I don't know, he is not able to tell me brother He is doing it right, he is doing it well means it is so easy doesn't it mean that it is your I am my own man and very good, very good He is a good guy, he is very humble, that means he Why have you got success? I have seen the same struggle, everything and yes, self belief self believe this is our hard work it keeps making me think that if we don't We are able to do it and we try like this no it is not happening let it go and we will do it again how long will we do it, it won't happen because the same thing isn't it where we're coming from I don't want to go now, I have to go further and from there Our family's thing is also connected She also motivates people like us a lot. Human beings have energy, right? Yes. like you I brought out that warrior energy. A Well, cities also have energy. Yes. So How do you like the energy of Bombay? I haven't come to Bombay that far. Matches I come because of this but very lively It seems so. People always look at me Let's go. Meaning there is only one city 8 After 9:00 pm you moon. but it is like this here But it doesn’t happen. People are so busy, Is career oriented. Feel it in stadiums too It happens. Every stadium has a different energy. Mumbai Meaning what is the energy of Wankhede? When is Wankhede's unreal? So that rally It was unreal, still our team would have settled down Is. So different level means crazy loyal fan meaning we are very fortunate that we are Playing for India. Of the Wankhede crowd What remains of energy? She is very good. It means a lot when people say things like Vande Mataram means the crowd comes. really mean You have such good energy, don't you? you will go if you cast a particular spell are you cheating on me this is so good I feel it, I mean, really, very much good vibes means if you go to a couple of stadiums If you say so, Wankhede is one of them in which the game it feels so good I feel the love of the audience very much I feel very much like this is the end of the podcast no way I would like to tell you one thing in between Yes, friend, those who understand cricket No, the fans who are still not convinced with Test cricket Follow it carefully we all love Dhruv Join. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you. and we Love you for your process. Thank you. this which Is there discipline in your game? Is. So just be you because 100%. I Feel You are already becoming a pillar of India And the strength of that pillar will increase further. time is full with as much time as is needed I can't talk about it 100% tomorrow Yes, do a little about Abhishek Sharma talking in The best innings I have seen till date innings hum friend what happened to them not how is he playing me no he always does He plays with it like this. now the thing is that tomorrow I have played such a good innings till date I have never played such a good innings sitting in front. Really mean those who were batting from the East no proper cricketing shots to we were being selfish ki yaar 34 I should score a century, I should score a century at 34 The record will be broken but the way he played Incredible hmm nice to watch how is he deep inside i felt he was also going to Have a big IPL this year is very cool he is a guy, if you ever talk to him then He has only one mistake every day, Paaji ji Yesterday I asked him if he should bat Hey, I told you that if the day passes then it means He is a very cool guy, he lives in the present Absolutely awesome we uvipa copy paste mentality really mean it looks mean something mean uv It is evident that Paaji has worked so hard on him Already when such a senior player If he gives close coaching then something changes Young people have a huge advantage because if they have so much Senior player who has played such big games Tournament Comments Up Uske Experience there is a meaning for every thing if that thing is saying something isn't it so after thinking about it because He has been in that situation many times You need one thing, not the exam I have brought the answer for it, you can see it It is very helpful, my question to you is this that you shared the dressing room with Jose Patla with yes wicketkeeper batsman right so What conversations took place there The conversations used to be that I would tell them this I used to ask you that you play with so many over periods and you are now a captain so what does that mean There has been a change over the period so he said friend Nothing, I just kept gaining experience And I learned faster from experience So if I am failing, why am I failing? So it's not that I mean that thing did you neglect it or not it's ok if you go with that thing learned and it feels great that if someone If the appreciation comes from such a big player then I was with them for 3 years and I have been playing for 3 years. So every year I meet her, she always tells me that you look Improvement always feels good to me It seems whenever he used to say yaar you are Improved is that thing that yes, somewhere no you are doing something good Whatever you are becoming, that is what is mine That is success for me, success is like for me Success is like being the best version of yourself Yourself and a place that you don't want to stay Friend, you are in one place, nothing came from there I just won't play like that, I don't know my You have to learn by going out of your comfort zone Kohli should have played with Rohit Sharma as well play with jos butler as well Play. What is the common thing? All the dedication because I feel that Those are such good contracts what is it that they have Keeps you motivated for now to play for Their respectable countries. So that every one I don't have it because there are a lot of players are they comfortable that they are a Running value. So it would have been a respectable thing Isn't it true that it is for our country above all money fame they are giving all in to her that respect that I feel for them Makes it different. Jos Buttler understands that his How big is your fan following in India? Yes yes I understand. He understands completely. Have you ever talked to him about India? about? Since the time I started playing cricket We haven't done it since he has been playing IPL So they understand that everything means AB de Villiers Jos Buttler Lasith Malinga These Few There are players who have a fan following in India We add a lot of foreign players in it Let's do it in some desi player's game It means a lot to you, a different perspective To be like to be care like It's okay to be careless sometimes, not that You don't have to do this, you have to do it sometime You won't think of things like this, nor do I want it She will drift away from you and someday should that's okay because there's a David As he was telling ash bhai that a The butterfly's quote is that if you If you try to catch her, she will not come, you are still If you stay, I would come and sit on your shoulder someday Is We mean we want to play cricket out of desperation without you you just enjoy the cricket the rest will take care of itself means your You will come whoever comes we are foreigners se bro who is your hetmyer you can Hitmyer End Obed Mokoy and Ferreira that's South African player like they were good flab yes enjoy I try to make sure every thing doesn't get out Meaning they enjoy learning the thing How much can he get off the field for this I am very chill, I don't think out, friend it's done i could have done better that's fine next Their approach does not change with the same approach We were getting out now what happens That now I don't do anything else, this is my game I will trust it, we have the same self belief Too much self-belief Self-belief maybe Because of confidence on a human level yes it comes 100 because there is a little bit of it in us Why don't I have self belief? I think the reason is because we are in India I am playing cricket. I'm scared sometimes From the public. also from the public No. going back where you came from If I get out, where will I go, people? Because looking at the public I believe that they They troll and memes are made. it's ok Friend, it means everyone has their opinion. it's ok and They are giving hard and money to watch you. Give will also think that you will perform this That's normal, it's acceptable. But Don't let that thing go to your head. because he It is temporary. If You Are Not Doing Well There Will troll you. They will make meme out of you. but if you start performing they will like I will lift you up and keep you up. so that's the public's It's not the side that's trolling you. You also have that side that if you do well I will not fight with anyone else on your behalf They. How are you saying that he is doing this This is what he did. so it's what it means That is the reason why cricket is so popular. Are there cricket memes exchanged? Insta DM? yes yes we were very happy Are. I mean exactly, because now I It's probably been 7-8 months. I don't use I have a friend of mine and I gave it to him because I think that a little There is distraction because there is so much content Now you can see reels on Instagram If you keep watching, I feel a little that it is a waste of time but the reels which makes them their sense of humor I don't know where you get so much brain from We are guys so we enjoy a lot when You should also see hmm, you know? A new term has emerged It is in the world of Genghis. it is called Brain rot I think. Brain rot. Brain Rot Meaning, it will rot the mind. means backwards going. Yes. going in reverse. going in reverse. well maybe. And this is being fueled by short content Because of. that means if you sit down All day long with reels. So then your Dopamine systems go haywire. It is possible Is. so that's what I needed It is not so much that I get distracted That means no matter how strong you become If you see something that you It doesn't seem like she stays in my mind. This way No, yes, it stays in my mind, friend Why did he say that? That's not how I am Is. Why is this so? So there is no need to see No. Why? I mean I mean I'm taking Care of my body. I am taking care of My mind. I will not see it. we these It is very important for a cricketer. Very It is necessary. is a must. because we Actually cricket after one point you It is played through the mind. 100% no 100% They say it's a psychological battle Bowling vs Batting. Yes. because no one A match is going on, there is a bowler His so much hype, stats etc. this, that, at At the end of the day you have to see the ball. Your I don't need to look at the stats. If your Your skills and your mind are right on that day will be. Your planning will be correct. you will If the pebbles are his then they are simple one Do not bring extra unnecessary things that friend He does this, he bowls the ball like this, So it stays in your mind, he put it there No, this is already on your mind he does it, he does it, now look at the ball You have batted only against Adeep, yes What is that vibe of my first IPL? A six probably over covers on Adeep But what makes you think that they have so many Why have you got wickets at the international level one is very Discipline is very hard working and he is cold very cold means do you ever see He knows that there is no expression after taking a wicket It means the same self-belief of a cool mind He is bowling with a cool head I think we are the same thing because everybody has the skill but this There is an extra value that you add, right? ho up your game the next time you think about it How can I make my team win the match I can say that Adeep that's why he is like That's why I'm asking you about them because i am his fan but also i I am asking you because you have discussed Bumrah's case Shared a dressing room with him. Trent Also shared dressing room with Bolt Is. These are two great bowlers. so friend if What do you need to become a great bowler? remains mentally what you have known because I also feel neither wicketkeepers nor bowlers Understand deeply. self believe that We need more than just batsmen Because they have such a small margin that it is half If a little bit here and there in volley and yorker dist vo hua length What happened was that ball was not hit by anyone at this level Chota Half Balli Will Smash You For Six So the same thing in that situation Thinking that if my yorker is not there then If it falls it will be a six and you will lose the match The same thing means controlling those nerves If such people are your teammates. Bumrah, Trent Boult to improve as a batsman Are you there? too much. too much of one There is a challenge, right? Now we don't even know that friend what is he thinking and we too I am also waiting for that person to miss you I hit. He is also waiting. So that one It's a thing like that. Now at that time who is so I am determined that no, friend, I will win. They He said, I will win. So it is the same thing. Controlling the same thing sets you apart From the crowd. We feel the same. Bumrah as a How is the captain? Mast absolutely mast means me ko friend i am also playing with rohit bhaiya Am. Rohit Bhaiya is the one who scolds Are. But when he goes out he says, "Brother, I play like this and I like it like that I want to play because I don't like any of you I want to bring out the best and I know how Have to take it out. And talk to them. Big Brother Seems like I mean I mean the Indian team I feel like talking to a senior No. It doesn't seem like you are a senior friend. are you talking to. They explain the meaning like this That we were also at this stage like you are. So When I was with Rohit Bhaiya, I had a lot of fun. Means when Rohit bhaiya said dressing room I was a bit scared when I was sharing it A little here and there, all the big players till today I didn't see it. So he said you came comfortably first Enjoy the day, you already know the atmosphere. You Just Go Out And Play Freely. that's me I will take care of the rest. That means, that's enough saying He gave it. That was enough for me. So, I enjoyed it a lot. We are big brothers yes it is going to be complete so you can play it little one yes You play, I am here, do this we are a Kohli Bhai never scolds, he scolds someone no no share dressing room with him To do it was a dream come to a moment And but his vibe is totally Delhi boy totally carefree It is really big yes it is really fun Anybody has a great sense of humor we mean we have a lot of fun they mean us and Whose sense of humor is broken, one is Rohit Regarding brother, obviously you have read his press You must have heard about that conference also, Virat Bhai I mean these are the two that seem to be on top How is the presence of both of us There are such legends in the dressing room not with you, what if something happens to me Personally, I feel like this, friend I mean I go into flashbacks. I saw it like this by doing it really but after that it also feels like that friend brother it is very easy means like this I never thought that we would have thought that he would be like this It will be like this but you can approach it very easily you can talk to him, he will talk to you further If you do it then it will not be like that, there will be no line we are between seniors and juniors Do you feel it or not friend senior Junior means a complete team atmosphere and family Seniors live like juniors When do they scold me, I feel it only on the field is that in the moment we should do this, do this because it is necessary because we don't even I don't know what we're going to do From the angle of professionalism, yes Never in the way of professionalism which You don't mean to diminish you or something like that and chill together we do it, we chill a lot, yes we like Not in the hotel but in the dressing room It happens in the dressing room, right? Because after that everyone goes to their rooms. They leave because the match lasts for the entire day but whatever happens in the dressing room It happens, lunch happened, something happened friend field If any funny moment happens then it's fun Let's come and enjoy, okay just one last time The last section in the podcast is It's Ending Thoughts because IPL is very close now Is. yes I am thinking about it I am still thinking about it I'm not gonna lie but I'm thinking the same thing I am saying that friend, he has to win the championship how to win There is something we have to do to prepare differently you are doing something, just a little I am improving my self a little more Sometimes it happens that it shifts here and there that yes tell yourself this that this These are small things. It seems like right now They will not be of any use. Sometimes it doesn't work Is. The only thing is that you have not prepared yourself I will leave it. No matter what happens. We do our hard work I will keep doing it and I have such a good team. And the biggest thing I mean I am so excited Rahul I want to play under sir because I am in under 19 I played because money is ok but guidance Because of how much cricket he has played and everything means because I test I am also playing cricket. He tested The last series in cricket which was held in England 3400 means IPL is also so good now If the Indian team won the World Cup then it meant that he was the coach If I get any guidance I will be very grateful I am excited for that, we talked for the last time When it happened he said that you are one of ours main player and we retain you because of your I really liked this dedication Friend Rahul sir is saying this we retain you because of dedication Your hard work and what you did in your last three He has grown his game over the year and he I liked that thing very much. I told you sir whatever you said I am ok to do it. I know you I am from Mumbai I am an Indians fan. but because of people like you So RRB has become the second team. So genuinely thank you. Thank you so much. End Thank you to papa as well. I feel that today If I genuinely want to know your story then further You went and did a lot for India. The whole country stopped and thanked your father Tell. yes tell this to didi also then she said no because didi wants me on Activa The poor girl used to take me along and I used to tell her that let me steer let me steer Poor girl leaves me and comes to the academy Right now you only have points of inspiration For. really a lot of inspiration means now we Both of them sit down sometimes, my sister I struggled so much that even my sister noticed it He also supported everything very much and Big thing, I forgot to tell you that part. my diet is about me so my dada Everyone was a wrestler so there was so much expense in buying protein If he wasn't there then what would we have done if he was Wrestlers used to take the same diet Mummy, many times he even used his finger Pichal diya means one thing that is called silbatana whatever is of his stone is in it What are almonds in a shell break it into pieces and do that to cool it down She used to make me feed her 50-60 almonds every day I used to drink only cold drinks so that was my diet It means a lot, I think about it, a lot It feels good and I get emotional too, I am happy it would also mean that if he was not there then I It is not available here, it was very necessary Desi Veg Built his cricket career on the strength of diet Complete like you know that those relatives of yours too Are you watching this podcast? yes now I think if my father were here too Somebody else's child would have been playing in that place Perhaps we would have said it like this that our Because what dad was doing made no sense There is no use of doing this away from society Were living. So I think it is a bit Thinking happens. What do you know, I'm a little If I could reach this much then any other parent would think That I feed my son. What It must be risky. If it happens then glory Is. Otherwise it's okay. Otherwise, you are mentally You will become strong. Yes. I feel that this is a This could be the worst case scenario for sports But at least I have seen no parents in that if he goes then he does not think that mentally What difference does strong make to him? I may or may not be mentally stung. he has to It should remain well settled. if you are mentally You are strong if you are not making money, If your house is not running then what is the use of this In making you mentally strong? Or I hope that today many young cricketers got the inspiration. Genuinely brother, thank you. I feel like that I should also go and get the 21 strain for myself I feel like working hard on the band too Should I do it? Your discipline rubs off on all of us And always cheering for the group. thank you so Much. Thank you so much.
