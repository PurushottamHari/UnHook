1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,879
Dhruvail you would have played for India

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,480
yes what was that feeling

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,200
Is? Whenever I play an India match

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,719
Even if I get out. so daddy so much

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,960
Oh, no problem. when you look in tricolor

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,960
If not, my chest would swell with pride

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,320
Is. My papa was a constable. Quick

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
Had to take voluntary retirement. Because

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
Papa had a heart attack on duty.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
So he had to take up a job because of me.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
So he is someone's bodyguard so I told papa

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,559
Literally I saw him opening the door. to papa

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,600
I did not tell you but I came home and felt a little

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
When he cried, I said he wanted a kit bag but he refused

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,280
Did it. Then Mummy told him to sleep

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
Sell ​​the chain and get a kit bag for it.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
I had promised mommy, mommy no

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,239
also my earning will come first to you

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,039
I will tell you that gold

20
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:53,199
I will get it for you. Then RR picked me. He is very

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,280
It was a big day because my father told me that

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,440
Din had said that son you got picked in RR.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
You shut everyone's mouth. where are you

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Did you study till now? First year of BA is over

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,080
My. I have time now for my second year.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,760
Not found. Are you thinking about the exam? Yes.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,760
Since when did you start playing international matches?

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
So, I am not getting any time at all. Hopefully no

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:16,400
meet. India

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,200
call means he always thought that baggy blue

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
Is. I always visualized that I am a BCI

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
I am watching TV on Virat Bhai's side

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,439
My name is written in it. and exactly the same

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,080
Happened. Sharing a dressing room. Rohit

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,080
Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah. Common

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
what is the thing? This is what it feels like in the Indian team

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,119
Talk to some senior, I don't think so

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,200
That friend you are talking to a senior.

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,040
He explains the meaning in such a way that we too are at this stage

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,479
But I was like you. something happened to me

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,000
Personally. so I go into flashback

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,600
Yes, I saw this on TV. Every cricketer Dhoni

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,680
Why can't it be done? I had said that

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
Bhaiya how are you so comfortable? They

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,079
He said, if you work so hard, you will win 10 matches

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,240
I will do that twice. This is MS Dhoni's M

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,079
S Dhoni in the position he used to bat

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,680
In that position I do it and its

49
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,280
Hard

50
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,920
because in australia in england

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,040
Cricket is just a support for them but for

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,119
As no, this is our religion, we are leaving

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,399
Our deeds go by touching the ground with our feet

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,239
movie

55
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,720
I won't say much Dhruv Judel

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,599
I will just say about them that I

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,599
I am a fan of mentality, but this person's mentality

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,560
I am not the only fan of . even if it

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,280
Be it Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Suresh fan

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,760
I have spoken to countless senior cricketers

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
I have talked about these. Everybody Pole

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,120
Talks about Judel's mentality

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
Is. And in the long term the world of cricket

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,840
Mentality is what matters the most

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Because everyone works hard. this is an

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,720
IPL special. On It's a Cricket Special

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Morally it's a mentality special we

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,710
Mamba Mentality Monster Dhruv Jude and D

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:03:04,300
R

00:02:49,710 --> 00:03:04,300
[music]

71
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,599
S pole root looks great that you

Be in the studio. thank you for having me

73
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,080
Or not I am having love with you friend. on my mind

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,080
There was a conflict going on as to whether I should do this

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
Should I say it in the end or in the beginning? In the end

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,080
I will tell you something after knowing you a little.

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,640
But in the beginning I would like to say that I have

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,560
Watch cricket for my entire life. and right now

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,560
I don't know which young players

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
I see the right attitude. that long ago

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,799
I get to know from it. first of all thank you what are you

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,360
Already done for the country.

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,239
You played a solid innings in Test cricket

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,040
In. A love watching in IPL as well.

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,519
Honestly. There are some players where

86
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
I am waiting to see his game, friend

87
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,239
Is. you are one of those guys because of your

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,159
Mentality. Thank you so much. then was very

89
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
Excited that you are coming to the studio.

90
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,480
It feels good sitting in front of you. thank you

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,640
You so much. Pleasure. The seriousness that you have

92
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,720
No, she looks good. showed seriousness

93
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,360
gives it to your game. the whole world

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,799
Class athletes are serious. A who

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,799
He also played everything seriously for India

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,319
There are. Some are more serious

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,720
Like you. Thank you. Thank you. Agree? all of that

98
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,720
I think that from my upbringing

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,799
It comes. My father was in the army when I was a child

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,280
I have learnt from this that meaning does not mean anything

101
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,680
don't take this as a joke because everything

102
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,840
It is serious. If you want to take yours

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,160
If it is above me then whatever I do I give it my 100%

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,080
And I give something like this fun

105
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
I don't see that friend this is that because for me

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,320
who knows that if he does not do well in the future

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,199
If that happens then I will regret that thing

108
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,759
I try to always give my 100% and

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,759
I should be in full focus. for india when you

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,960
What is that feeling when you are playing?

111
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,040
It is very good and whenever it is from India

112
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,800
I have played for it so it feels like that means

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,440
I am representing India because

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,520
As a child, I had a dream that I would do something in India

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,840
I should do it for this and not for cricket already

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,320
Was. I grew up watching my father. Papa is very

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,759
There was discipline. My papa was a constable. So

118
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,639
I think that I am in a higher rank

119
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,400
I want to represent something for India. so i

120
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,120
Wanted to do NDA till at least. then to me

121
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,960
I felt that it wouldn't be possible, friend. I tried

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,120
But I play street cricket a lot

123
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,520
So I started playing. I Papa

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
I have told him many times that Papa, I want to go to India

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
So I have to do it but side by side

126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,840
I also want to play cricket. So dad said no

127
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,400
because there is a mentality which is in the middle

128
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,639
Class ki yaar cricket is a gamble because

129
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,479
how many people are playing and very few

130
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,800
There is a percentage who can reach that level. So

131
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,600
That was the one my mom liked. He also refuses

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,080
I used to do this because one of them was expensive

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,080
it's a game and you are not sure that your

134
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,479
The child will go to the team where he/she is

135
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,039
It becomes stable and you start earning well

136
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,720
If you go, it was always decided that you would join the government

137
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,120
If I take a job then anything can happen to me

138
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,479
It was like, okay, I am in Papa's line.

139
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
I will go and do something for India

140
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,759
I always thought I would do something for India

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,000
what happened those were the days of summer camp

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,400
Two-three friends decided that some

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Let's do it in this summer camp, everyone has decided

144
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,080
did that swimming pool school classes

145
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,240
Let's take it. I said okay let's go. So

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,400
I was there where the forms were being filled out

147
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,360
When I went to fill in the form I saw kids playing

148
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,840
watch white race match yes playing cricket

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,960
So he filled the swimming pool form.

150
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,680
I have filled the cricket form and come back

151
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,800
quietly and I came with them but wight

152
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,440
I brought the kit. I borrowed ₹250 from my mom

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,360
and a triple N white kit comes

154
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Was. I just had that on me, I had gloves on

155
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,319
There was something there. I did this so that I could play cricket

156
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
I started playing and my friends said brother you

157
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,160
Where are you going? Brother, I saw you there

158
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
He abused me and said you are a cheater

159
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,919
This is it my friend, let me try it out

160
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,440
no because I won't tell mom and dad

161
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,360
I could have told them that

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Papa told us to take care of the swimming pool

163
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,160
I have told you not to go in such deep water

164
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,840
yes yes you will see it then I would have come

165
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,120
I came and kept walking like this so mom

166
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,800
when I told him that this is my white

167
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,280
I play with my dress, it's dirty

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
hey mummy will wash it then you said what is this dress made of

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,759
I have done it just like that, he said swimming pool

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't understand this costume

171
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,400
I secretly told this to my mother

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,160
I cried a lot, I cried a lot that please

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,800

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,880

177
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,520
When I gave it to him, he said, yes it would cost ₹200-₹300

178
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,599
Papa, I'll get you some of that

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,800
I am not a tennis player, I play with a leather ball

180
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,039
I am a professional so I need something good

181
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Professional to English, Philosopher to English

182
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,880
I don't know if there is a Philo bat

183
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,639
but there comes a Kashmir willow bat which

184
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,720
let's start so I said papa that

185
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,319
Give it to me, how much does it cost

186
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,520
It was worth ₹850 ₹900 so dad was thinking

187
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,000
It will cost Rs. 200-300 and my father at that time

188
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,720
I had retired, the house also means loan etc.

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,120
When it was moving, that table was not in that position

190
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,520
If you could give me a bat worth 850 then I would

191
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,879
Everyone cried and then he started playing well

192
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,639
I had gone a little bit because whenever

193
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,360
When I started playing, I only had a bat

194
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,960
I used to borrow the next spade for someone

195
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
Then it felt like friend, I also need my own

196
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,240
How long will I keep asking for it, then I muster up the courage

197
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,039
After making it he said to me baba kid back

198
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,759
I asked if I wanted it but at first I refused, state

199
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,160
You won't get it, I want to play with you

200
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
If you don't want to play then come, his only solution was to leave

201
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,639
Let cricket come back and use your brain again

202
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,479
I don't know what habits he has acquired from his government job

203
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,240
When I said that I have adopted it, he refused

204
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,360
did I give it to you or not papa please give it to me

205
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,479
Give it to me, I cried, everything happened in two-three days

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,479
It's been 4 days and it's been going on like this, right?

207
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,560
When I got it, I always went to my mommy

208
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,200
go to mommy see talk to daddy

209
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,200
Look, papa talked to mummy

210
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,320
I also scolded him saying that you have spoiled it

211
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,240
it has happened to you, if you don't correct it then

212
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,080
I'm going to kill him, so I thought, now

213
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,600
what should i do and i was dead

214
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
Seriously, I want to play cricket only.

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,040
because I was enjoying it so much and my

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
I felt like I could do something

217
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,760
From the first day I looked different

218
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,839
Was. I felt that yes, these kids

219
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,959
I am a little different from. When did we find out that

220
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,200
Do you play well? It seems to me that

221
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,120
It was initially known in a month when

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,279
I used to play street cricket with him earlier

223
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,760
Was. I used to play very well in that too. But

224
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,920
What was the role? Batsman. batsman keeping

225
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
did you do it? No. Ok. She also did the keeping

226
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,320
It is an interesting story. I will tell you.

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,040
So I started, I was batting and

228
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,880
The medium page used to bowl. Wow! Yes.

229
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,880
Because there was aggression and not a medium

230
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,399
Have to insert page stage. going into the hollow through

231
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,800
The meaning was like this. So I said kit bag.

232
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,720
If I want it then I refuse, then I go to the bathroom

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
I went and was taking a bath. I don't know what I

234
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,880
It clicked. I'm talking while taking a shower

235
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,040
if you don't get me my kit bag

236
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,720
Then I'll leave the house and run away

237
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,560
I will go. So papa said yes, you go.

238
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
Papa told me to go away. by doing so that

239
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,000
He knew that he wouldn't go. Mummy

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,560
She took that thing a little seriously. Son is the same

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,360
Is. And then what did mom do? Now their

242
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,040
There was a gold chain. He gave it to papa. it

243
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,320
take this sell it to this means kit for this

244
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,399
Bring the bag. So that thing occurred to me at that time

245
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
I did not realise it because I felt that

246
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,080
Yes, it's okay, they are my parents. the work is

247
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,160
We are doing our part. What happened? then like

248
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,600
I have started earning, so I

249
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,680
After one year I played under 14 states

250
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
So some money came from there. So when to me

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,880
Realization started when I told mom

252
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
Was promised to. Mom, no one is the first

253
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,160
My earnings will come to you, whatever you say, I will do that

254
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,399
I will get you that gold. Because what our

255
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,560
The UP type of families which are

256
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,800
They get a lot of fascination from not sleeping

257
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,519
that yes gold gold gold because everything

258
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,120
we see it because mom and dad are not together

259
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,880
Even when you go to a wedding someone judges you

260
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
If you do then judge by your sleep that friend

261
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,200
He is wearing gold so he is very rich

262
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,279
So a mother has always had a

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,839
Because mom and dad always struggled so much

264
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,720
Papa has always supported mummy in life

265
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,959
When I stayed with him as a housewife, this was my situation

266
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,160
Now I will give you whatever you say

267
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,200
I will get it for me when I get a good one in 14-16

268
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,000
I could not earn this much in just Rs. 1000

269
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,720
7-8000 per match when I was in Under 19 World Cup

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,200
When I played cup, I got some good money

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,839
I got a lot of gold for my mommy

272
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,399
I bought only gold, take it mom

273
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,279
I hugged Sir and sat down as if he

274
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,839
Made my name famous and it means a lot

275
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,640
He had tears of joy, I loved it a lot

276
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,200
It felt good, even 14 crores was a lot

277
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,240
People can buy more gold, should I tell the truth

278
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
And brother, now I don't like that 14 crore

279
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
ok but what you started with

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,600
Earning, the earning that I had was a lot

281
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,160
Now I have got 14 crores, it's okay.

282
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,120
worked hard for it my parents whatever

283
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,519
I have coaches who are there for everyone at the right time

284
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
It's not mine alone but I feel

285
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,760
This is what I earned in the beginning

286
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,079
I had started doing it, which was a realization

287
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,240
I am missing him so much right now that I love him so much

288
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,720
Anyway, money doesn't make that much difference

289
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,880
just want to do well for my country to bas

290
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,800
So that's it, whatever you are to me

291
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,640
Whosoever comes, I give it to papa

292
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
Papa please I don't need anything, really

293
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I have literally given his account.

294
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
that papa you look after it because I have no

295
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,560
There is no fascination, it's okay with money, friend

296
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
All I wanted was that I should not have to tell my

297
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,720
We don't want to give a good life to our parents because

298
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,399
He has struggled so much I am

299
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,079
Sure everybody would do it, but I

300
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
I have seen my parents struggle

301
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,560
I have struggled so much that I can do whatever I want

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,959
I still want her to be like that

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,720
If there is mentality then the mother's legs will ache

304
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,639
It happens that Papa is also getting older, so am I

305
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
I am telling you to keep a caretaker. They

306
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,160
She also refuses. What happened? I do

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,720
I will take it. So why give money to anyone?

308
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,279
He still has this mentality. because he

309
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,760
He showered every penny on me

310
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,760
I have fed him. I have taught my sister. So that one

311
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,920
Seeing this thing I feel that my friend Papa

312
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,440
Now I have started earning. Do it now, friend.

313
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,519
But still they say that what

314
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,600
will he do it? Money will be wasted. I will do it no

315
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
This that. Then sometimes I get angry too

316
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,160
Would. What am I earning and for whom?

317
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,000
I am earning for you. So he right now

318
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,000
I am explaining it to you but you don't understand. Is

319
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,399
So, parents.

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,519
But do they like this feeling?

321
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,680
That his son is a great player? For them

322
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
The best thing seems to be that the son is the country's

323
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,959
is playing for. whenever i am in india

324
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,760
I play the match even if I get out

325
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,240
So. So hey, it doesn't matter. when you are the tricolor

326
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,600
I can see my chest proudly

327
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,040
It becomes wider.

328
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,800
I had to tell you one thing after we met. We

329
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
I have been following you for a long time

330
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,040
Is. I don't know if I think you are missing me

331
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,399
Is. yes yes yes it's been maybe two-three years

332
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,920
Are. yes and when i saw your name retention

333
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,200
This is all I had to do on the list. Really

334
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,600
Happy I am genuinely happy from the heart.

335
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Aki who is sitting behind the camera. This too

336
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,800
He is a big cricket fan. Your words I

337
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,959
I have been doing this for a very long time. And

338
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,000
Fortunately, many seniors came through the show

339
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,160
Cricketers were also present. Everybody is your

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,399
talks about mentality and

341
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,440
It is said that connecting far will take you a long way.

342
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:00,000
So it feels good, that means everybody praises it

343
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,839
But what I told you in the beginning

344
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,519
It's all about upbringing. like i mean it like that

345
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:09,120
Behaviour is because of mom and dad because they

346
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,320
They are also like this. and there is one and not some

347
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,480
After achieving the achievement you are a little high

348
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,639
You go away. But he is always grounded

349
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,000
We keep it. So papa always says that B

350
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,160
Be humble, be helpful, help everyone. so that's it

351
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's a thing like that. So I am very into it

352
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I believe that if I do good to someone

353
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,639
If I do, God is watching somewhere

354
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,040
To me. And I am a great devotee of Bajrangbali

355
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,440
I am a devotee since childhood. Hail Bajrang. Jai bajarangabalee.

356
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,760
So there have been a lot of those. means to me

357
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,760
It seems that who I am today is not my meaning

358
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,880
Right because of parents, right because of coaches

359
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,440
At the time I have seen that many

360
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,519
Do cricketers live during the time of Bajrangbali?

361
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,279
I don't know what power comes from them because my

362
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,880
So this is where I had a ground

363
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,519
Not from where I started playing cricket

364
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,480
Spindle Cricket Academy who was the coach there

365
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,440
Parvinder Yadav, he always comes to my house

366
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,680
He lived near. So this was me, I am in the Army

367
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,000
I used to study in school. so when the kids get out of school

368
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,240
If I were going home, I would have attended school

369
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
When I was going, I would meet them upside down

370
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,040
So they asked you did you come to school because I

371
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,560
He used to be the first guy who would immediately get a holiday

372
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,959
He used to stand at the gate to give me time

373
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,680
Don't waste 15 minutes by cycling

374
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,000
I used to go to school or sorry home then there was a kit

375
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,160
He was there after having food with bags etc.

376
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,240
If I lived there then he would have made me sit on his bike

377
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,920
He used to carry the kit bag in the middle while sitting on the bike

378
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,920
I used to go there every Tuesday and our

379
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,120
There is a temple of Bajrangbali there so I will go there

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,040
I used to go and I still go because if

381
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,079
If something of mine was going left or right then

382
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,800
I go and apologize to them

383
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,800
If something happened then forgive me, it means

384
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,639
I am very attached to Bajrangbali since childhood

385
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,800
You think about them even on the ground

386
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,959
I think a lot and that gives me strength

387
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,000
I feel that my parents and I are the ones

388
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,079
Because when I go to the ground

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,079
First I close my eyes and pray to my parents

390
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,240
I think about what they

391
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,560
Blessings have been given to the coach

392
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,560
I think of Bajrangbali and

393
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,480
I take a deep inhale. I double inhale

394
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,480
So, I like it. I am a friend

395
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
Where do I start with this podcast?

396
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,079
with? I don't understand because

397
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,199
Actually I want to talk to you a lot. Yes.

398
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,600
Maybe let's start with one reel. Rihan

399
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,800
when I was talking with you then your words

400
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,279
Curry. Yes. Nobody wishes ill upon you.

401
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,639
In the cricket world. and honestly the audience

402
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,839
I would like to say this to. I am not saying this Dhruv bhai

403
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,680
have been. This is what I am saying about cricket

404
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,839
In this world people do evil to each other.

405
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,800
Often I've never had anyone speak badly

406
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,600
About you. Let's watch that reel once.

407
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,480
What is Dhruv connected like? Dhruv is the

408
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,199
The Hardest Guy Practices Who Likes the

409
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,759
Like it's hard practice. it's not like

410
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,920
It's not for the soft softies. it's like

411
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,079
Hard practice. I see I tell you those

412
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Cramp things, right? that happens to him

413
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,600
Almost every practice. He is like that.

414
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,000
He He Just Feels Happy When He Works

415
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,880
Hard. if he doesn't get runes he will work

416
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,640
even harder like that just goes on

417
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,000
Even this IPL he just kept on working

418
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,079
hard and that's been going on for the last

419
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,079
Two Years I Have Been With Him For The

420
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,120
For the Last Two Years We Share Rooms We Do

421
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,600
everything together and i have just seen him

422
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,480
he is a fun guy he is a very fun guy of the

423
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:23,439
in the field we go out hang together he loves his

424
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,720
coffeera but then at practice he just like

425
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,880
I said mama mentality or just get done

426
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,480
Regardless

427
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,400
Mama Mentality Mama

428
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,160
If I tell you the truth, this is my mentality

429
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,960
I didn't even know the meaning of this word, uncle

430
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,960
Mentality is a series, last

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,640
Dance is where all this fascination came from

432
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,679
I saw it for the first time

433
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,679
See wow, is there an approach like this as well

434
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,760
Because in to be honest cricket this happens

435
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,679
The approach is very less and many

436
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,600
Viewers may not have seen The Last Dance

437
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,200
Is. The Last Dance is about Michael Jordan.

438
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,120
It's about Michael Jordan. Michael

439
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,600
Consider Jordan as the Kohli brother of basketball

440
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,760
Are. That's a good way to explain. So

441
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,039
There's a documentary of their final season

442
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,200
Where he made the team win. Butt Whole

443
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,600
His life was told in the documentary

444
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,720
And his mentality has been shown. Yes. So

445
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,520
I saw that and it started.

446
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,080
One episode in it is on Kobe Brain

447
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,240
Is. I said it's such a big basketball

448
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,840
is a player. He has an episode on it.

449
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,240
What's in it? Then I told him about

450
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,640
Read everything. Saw his documentaries.

451
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,559
everything that he does for his speeches, podcasts, etc.

452
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,720
Is. I said what is this guy? means his who

453
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,400
The training schedule was that in the beginning

454
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
He tells me that it is better to waste my time

455
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,880
I don't think so. and i don't like to go on

456
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,440
vacation because i don't want to regret it

457
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,679
I did this, I could have done better. So that one

458
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,720
why can't I become this thing that pleases me

459
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,400
I have tried this a lot,

460
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,280
To be honest, I am telling you this for the first time

461
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,480
I also tried the schedule Kobi ka Kobi

462
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,400
That I should sleep again for 2 hours at 4:00 in the morning

463
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
it couldn't happen in cricket

464
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
Then I realised that my friend

465
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,320
Is it an indoor game or an outdoor game?

466
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,360
It's difficult because you need wickets

467
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,360
If you want it fresh and do it early in the morning then you

468
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,280
Would not have been able to do it because there would have been a fresh wicket

469
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,880
The one in which the sun shines is hard

470
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,720
But there is so much moisture in the morning.

471
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,120
You can't play. I think the main scene is

472
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,160
It is about intention. Yes. no intention for

473
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,480
Greatness. Intention to be the best version of

474
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,360
Yourself. So it meant the same thing.

475
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,440
I tried to try the same thing and

476
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,880
It couldn't happen. But I felt that friend

477
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
What else can I do better? to me

478
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,600
It is not like that friend, they might be something else

479
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,919
By doing this. So I realised one thing that

480
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,640
You have to be consistent. whatever you are doing

481
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,240
it is not that you did this or that because

482
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,240
Sometimes

483
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,240
People talk about motivation, there should be motivation

484
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,120
Needed I don't think you are motivated

485
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,440
You will be able to do much more. one day two days but

486
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,480
It is discipline and not that brother this is your work.

487
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,480
you have to do it regardless of what

488
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,880
Have to do it. So I think that the thing

489
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,280
Is good. and then you see in it that you

490
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,360
How will you enjoy that thing? Now that's you

491
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,120
Find that friend I'm going to the gym. Go

492
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,840
Is. It's not like I have to go

493
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,320
Is. I have to enjoy. Ok? Give motivation

494
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,799
After that if I do this then this is my

495
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,919
It will be beneficial. If I do this then it will be beneficial

496
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,400
And your family's life will be better after going back

497
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,880
So it seems like everything is about you

498
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,039
If you are connected then you will do a lot of

499
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,679
The life of the sons will become better who

500
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,360
I have worked hard for you so you cheat on yourself

501
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,120
he is doing it ok but don't cheat them

502
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:39,200
Brother, this is Indian Mamba.

503
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,440
Mamba desi Mamba desi Mamba who is desi

504
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,320
Apart from you in the world of Mamba cricket

505
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,880
I think Mahi bro

506
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,280
Mahi bhai means whatever he has done for India

507
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,600
For

508
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,520
Unbelievable because to be honest with that

509
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,960
The position in which he used to bat

510
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,400
I do it and it's

511
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,640
hard because you don't know where you're going

512
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,559
There are three-four overs left. you can't take

513
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,080
I have to kill it as soon as the time passes. strike rate

514
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:12,720
Have to keep it well. The team needs it. thats

515
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,280
Why he is great. He did it and

516
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,120
Have done it repeatedly. So it seems to me that

517
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
Mahi bhai means I respect him a lot

518
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,080
Am. Whenever I meet them, I mean to

519
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,159
I just keep watching. So if I mean them

520
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,120
He achieved so much, he did not even achieve 1%

521
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,240
If I do it then I will be very grateful. His

522
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,720
Do you study games? Yes. Because all

523
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,159
One of his game is that he has a lot of self belief

524
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,320
Is. In what situation did his reading come and

525
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,679
They have such self-belief that sometimes it seems

526
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,720
That the situation demands 101 runs

527
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,720
I want it in one over but whenever he plays single or double

528
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,080
We are playing. They know that if I

529
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,320
If he takes me deep inside then I will do it. I

530
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,000
I will do it. And not many people have this belief

531
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,240
It is not that I am not my friend, if I could not be my friend

532
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,919
It couldn't happen. it is not in them, they do

533
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,080
and always means 80-90% of the time they

534
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,799
If we win matches because of him then I

535
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,440
It seems that every cricketer is like a legend

536
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,400
Why can't he become Dhoni?

537
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,200
According to you

538
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,080
I mean, I feel that becoming Dhoni is so

539
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,559
It is not easy

540
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,600
Because Dhoni sir has shown everyone that

541
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,840
Skill means nothing but their

542
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,400
There is mind and sharpness. the biggest thing i

543
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,480
Whoever feels like saying something about his mother and brother

544
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,679
no because it is very easy for me to say it too

545
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,559
that be in the present think about it

546
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,960
But they show it by doing it, they say it

547
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,440
Trust the process, they prove it

548
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,520
Friend I will think about it and rest

549
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,000
will take care of itself like this

550
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,440
But as a cricketer, I am telling you

551
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,120
It's so hard to stay in the present

552
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
Sometimes what happens is that you move ahead

553
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,840
Do you ever go backwards during an edge of a match?

554
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,760
this also happens because everything depends on you

555
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,600
you are doing calculations aren't you my friend

556
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,600
It has to be done, it has to be done. so a lot of things

557
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,559
Sometimes we forget to do simple things

558
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,120
my. Hum That's Why He Is The Greatest That

559
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,039
They do that thing. what we say is not

560
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
He has shown it by doing the thing. these lowers

561
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,200
Let's talk a little about the middle order. Yes

562
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,720
Yes, I do. you said it's a very

563
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,720
Difficult position. ya na as a fan

564
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,600
Obviously it is understood that the friend is aggressive

565
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,559
Batting has to be done immediately. Are we right? Meaning

566
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,960
This series did not take much time.

567
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,480
Is this a very difficult factor for him?

568
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,480
there is a difficult factor and that is because when you

569
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,200
When you go to the wicket you don't know that

570
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,440
How is the ball coming from the wicket? You don't have this

571
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,640
Know what variation the bowler is doing and when

572
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,640
what can you do and when you are batting at the top

573
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,919
if it is normal then they put normal good

574
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,960
length short ball this is when you go

575
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,360
They also know that he is here to slog

576
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Trying to bowl wide of the crease

577
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Are. If there is a slow run ball then it is one type of ball

578
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,400
We don't get that rhythm. One happens to be

579
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,880
get rhythm that the same ball is coming 140 145

580
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,640
140 145 now what happens when we go

581
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,400
Somebody wide of the cage yorker then

582
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,240
We can also predict different balls

583
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,640
I can't figure out what's going to happen

584
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,159
Because when I talked to Dhoni

585
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,919
So I said, brother you are so

586
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,640
how can you be comfortable because I am very

587
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:18,559
I was curious that you did it many times

588
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:23,520
He always said that you just be in

589
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,760
The Present Ball Dekh Just React And Wo Jab

590
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,600
It will come when you practice. We are now

591
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,200
what happens in practice is that we

592
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,440
yes we will take time because there is exit

593
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,840
Not there. Now he practices by putting pressure

594
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,320
Do that friend, these shots are my option

595
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,520
This is a field, so if you work hard

596
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,200
If he does it then it will happen twice in 10 matches. This much

597
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,840
It is less. That thing will be 100% 20%. These MS

598
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,799
Dhoni is saying. MS Dhoni and himself

599
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,279
I was telling you to watch my matches so that I

600
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:55,600
How much do I do? But when I do it, it's the same

601
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:58,320
There is enough and very few people do this.

602
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,600
you can name them, you will easily remember that

603
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,360
Who is it. That's why we are the greatest. So

604
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
I mean, I think a lot of

605
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,200
There are players who hit 100, hit 200

606
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,039
Are. But the impact that they have

607
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,080
Meaning the hardest position he took

608
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,440
Kankar has done it, that's why he is the legend. They

609
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,640
This could be a game changing position. 100% yes

610
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,960
It is a complete game changing position and very hard

611
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,279
is also there. That's why he does it very easily. So

612
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,440
I feel that whenever I too get something

613
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,679
If so, I watch their videos and

614
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,120
Whenever I get time, I talk to them.

615
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:34,480
Am. A This is a strange question. I don't you know

616
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,360
If that's the right question to ask. We butt ourselves

617
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,279
What is your career projection for ?

618
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,799
Meaning, what do you want to do in your career? This way

619
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,360
Have you thought of something for yourself? I like the boss very much

620
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,279
Keeping it simple means not thinking too much

621
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,000
because I can't predict tomorrow

622
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,159
therefore and whenever you predict

623
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,480
yes, I personally feel that it is

624
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,520
it is a human tendency that whenever you think about something

625
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,360
Yes, we think negatively first of all.

626
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,600
so it's the same thing so if I have some

627
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,600
Even if it happens then why not positive?

628
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,480
I will think about it, we will see if it doesn't happen

629
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,240
So I am okay so acceptance is there that

630
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
I would do the same in cricket too

631
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,960
if I play this is my plan if

632
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,039
could not accept that now what happens

633
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,720
you got out, you went out after making a plan

634
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,880
Once done, they tell you to do this

635
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,799
he would have done it why would he have done it you are

636
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm sure I have to do this, I couldn't do it

637
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,120
I will do it again, who knows there is something in the plan

638
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
I will come again and have had the experience

639
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,360
Now if I do something then it means to myself

640
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,600
Doesn't it demotivate me at all, friend?

641
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,679
It's done friend it's out it's okay this thing

642
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,679
I have learnt from Virat bhai and Rohit bhaiya

643
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,880
I have learnt it because whenever he gets out he comes

644
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,720
He is smiling and making everything normal

645
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,159
it is not like this and what would have happened to us

646
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,799
Because I've just turned one year old

647
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,960
Butt first for India while playing cricket

648
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,080
I used to get out and I used to coach myself a lot that

649
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,880
Friend, oh friend, what happened to this butt to him?

650
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,799
Look friend, now it has gone out i.e. part end

651
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,360
it's a parcel of the game and I think

652
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,159
Whatever success you get, it is not like that

653
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,000
How hard you work, how loyal you are

654
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,279
Having the right things at the right time is very important

655
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,200
Importent

656
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,360
You can expect legendary players in the test team

657
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,440
You are playing together. Sharing a dressing room.

658
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,080
Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jaspreet

659
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,760
Bumrah. we are with such people when you

660
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,640
If you share a dressing room then what type of dressing room?

661
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,440
Do you get mentorship? mentorship whatever

662
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,000
Do it, there is learning in that thing. means that

663
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,000
Everyone has seen what he does on the field

664
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,480
We do. But the things that happen off the field

665
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,039
They have made preparations regarding every thing.

666
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,799
Like there is a bag. How do you keep KidBack

667
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,919
yes. I mean those little things that you

668
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,039
How much do you give? How much does the bat care about him

669
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,720
You keep it with me. like bumrah bhai

670
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:43,200
Are. I am a big fan of Bumrah. Since

671
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,360
I have shared a dressing room with him.

672
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,039
He is a legend. i.e. those things too

673
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,480
We do it, right? Whenever something happens I

674
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,799
I talk to them like this. So whatever that

675
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,039
When we talk it feels like friend

676
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,960
No legend is talking. one of mine is big

677
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,000
Brother is talking. so it feels so good

678
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,919
Is. I mean, just yesterday those Nav Awards

679
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,080
When we met we were talking a lot

680
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,399
I liked it. I mean it is like that

681
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,320
there should be a perspective that when

682
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,520
If you had not met him, how would he be?

683
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,679
Off the way but Virat bhai Rohit bhai Bumrah

684
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,600
Brother you are very chill, you are very helpful sometimes

685
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,159
You can also go and talk about anything, will you?

686
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,679
Answer you abhi his vibe is different from hardik bhai

687
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:25,200
like literally means Rohit bhai Virat

688
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,279
Bhai and Bumrah bhai are absolutely normal and sincere

689
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,760
It means different if Hardik Pandya brother if

690
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,360
Whether you are in that room or not, the vibe of that room is different

691
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,480
yes really the way he talks his energy na

692
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,640
makes the whole room feel that yes

693
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,840
Hardik Pandya is a lion in our room

694
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,679
yes so really i mean these things in these

695
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,159
To learn a lot from small things

696
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,640
If I get it, then it means I will try to

697
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,279
I will learn anything from anyone I meet

698
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,039
I just want to learn something from Hardik Pandya

699
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,360
I always call him mentality monster 100%

700
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,120
it means that mentality has been formed

701
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,520
I have seen a lot because of the struggle

702
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,600
He has seen a lot because he never

703
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,279
Even now I talk to him a lot,

704
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,320
He always says that I have improved a lot

705
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,080
over the years it looks like that

706
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,640
How much did he improve himself?

707
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,840
Hmm and we are still improving

708
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,399
So like playing a match means it feels like

709
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,320
Someone is going we do match batting

710
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,320
I go bowling and I'm always 100% 200%

711
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,039
I mean it looks like they proved it

712
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,120
does that mean anything dude if you think that

713
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,440
You're gonna do it, you'll do it. what is it to you

714
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,600
It seems that the public is not sure about Hardik Pandya

715
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,200
What don’t I know?

716
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,559
I think he is very very humble

717
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,720
very caring helping means still i

718
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,720
When he came he said that DJ only calls me DJ

719
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,360
that no one will ever have any problem with you

720
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,279
yes, tell me. so that means this is the thing

721
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,039
It is not that I will call you tomorrow, brother.

722
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,520
But I felt good inside that friend

723
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,440
Hardik Pandya told me this. hmm

724
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,679
so the same thing means it is very

725
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,279
Helping to keep up with him when he's bowling

726
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,360
They are doing it. What is that feeling?

727
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,919
Because we don't know Hardik Pandya as a finisher

728
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,640
Let's talk a lot about. I am a tomorrow

729
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,320
stat was reading ben strokes and these

730
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
Comparison was being made. by sports kid

731
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,679
Had put it. Hardik Pandya scored more

732
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,679
Wickets taken in ODI age compared to

733
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,360
Ben Strokes. Why don't we talk

734
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,679
Was his bowling like this?

735
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,000
I think that everyone has accepted it

736
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,399
I have accepted that he does it. means I you

737
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,240
See if they play a T20 match sometime. Batting

738
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,600
If there is no batting then there is bowling

739
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
If he is not bowling then he definitely bats.

740
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,520
He gives all-round performance. thats

741
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,320
Why he is the MVP. What Impact We Make

742
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,000
Is? That is what I am telling you. At number six

743
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,440
if you are batting then if you are

744
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,960
Scoring 50 and with a good strike rate you

745
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,600
Be a different player, not everyone can do that.

746
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,159
Because accessing as you go and automatically

747
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,520
have belief because if you are taking

748
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:58,960
time is same dhoni bhai same if you are

749
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,120
It is taking time otherwise you will have to give it to everyone

750
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,679
I know that this guy is very confident

751
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,240
Because if you get out then 15 balls 15

752
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,159
Everyone will ask what is he playing

753
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
but those 15 balls I know that yes it's okay

754
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,240
Now I will take time in the last over

755
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,240
If I hit two-three sixes then he will believe it

756
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,279
It is also very important. this is the main factor

757
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,960
It happens. This is the main factor. we believe

758
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,279
Maybe among all the West Indies players

759
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,159
this is also the main factor at that part

760
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,360
Off the batting order like Andre Russell

761
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,039
Pollard Dwayne Bravo is his self believe

762
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,720
If I get the first ball I will hit it

763
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,279
by doing this one but that is one

764
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,240
Self belief is based on calculation

765
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,159
Friend, I will take my time to play such a game

766
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,480
and I'm gonna drive it like this one happens

767
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,720
The game which runs itself, I will run the game like this

768
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,039
I am the same thing Hardik Pandya

769
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,120
And Dhoni bhai, Rinku Singh is among them

770
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,440
He has the belief that I will play like this

771
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,039
I will do this again in the last, this one

772
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,200
thing is one layer deeper, okay I have this belief

773
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,840
because of practice because of practice

774
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,840
And this is the reason for doing this over and over period

775
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,399
I've done that many times you know

776
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,399
what is it because practice i know is good

777
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,039
Everyone does this to hone their skills

778
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,279
you upgrade yours but what you need

779
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,039
the idea comes from maths, if you

780
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,200
If you do it once, you get a feeling that

781
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,720
yes brother i did it like this good

782
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,519
Is. I can do it in the next match also. So

783
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,519
This confidence comes from matches. Rayna Brother

784
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,320
Recently I shot a video with

785
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,640
We. We have a new series called Taaqat Jahan

786
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,480
There is talk about mental strength. Yes. And

787
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,720
While talking about that same mental strength

788
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,880
Your name has come up. Ok. so he said

789
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,840
that he made you captain in UP

790
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:41,279
Was. Yes. And he said kudos to him

791
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:45,120
Because he brought T20 style batting

792
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,960
He is in his game. Yes. With hard work. Yes. A

793
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,440
Basically your batting will increase further

794
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:55,679
It has become aggressive for the sake of T20. We

795
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:58,000
a how did you do this journey from where you

796
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,240
were to where you are and could you even more

797
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,960
Try to bat more aggressively

798
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,720
Are you doing it and if yes then how? i you

799
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,120
Let me tell you how I pick in IPL

800
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,480
Happened. So

801
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,880
If there are trials then I have a friend

802
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,679
I mean we played under 142 karthik

803
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,320
Tyagi. Ok. Ok. So I told him friend

804
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,600
Look at me friend, if there are any trials

805
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,519
if I get it for that then he talked to me then that

806
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Time I was not playing state. So my

807
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,760
I did not even have any motivation, friend. Where was mine?

808
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,080
Will be from? Even I am not playing state.

809
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,799
What was your age? My age will be 21.

810
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,120
Ok. 21 After the World Cup Under 19 World

811
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,960
cup. So a lot of mean boys were picked up

812
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,360
Ravi Bishnoi, Yashasvi Jaiswal. so to me

813
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,440
I felt that I also want to play IPL

814
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,120
But friend, it was not picked up. then a little one

815
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,039
Motivation goes down. talk to dad

816
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,840
You always kept it. but sometimes

817
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,960
Overthinking also occurs. was 21 years old

818
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,799
I haven't played that much cricket. used to work hard

819
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,039
But I am not able to find that platform

820
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,360
Was. So I said to Karthik friend please

821
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,880
Look, he is my good friend. So

822
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,640
he said that time he was playing war

823
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:08,639
RR. So he called the video analyst

824
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,560
He said that Sir, it is a boy. So I said let's go for details

825
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,639
Send it. So he sent it. She completely

826
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,879
Properly written sir that is the one of the best

827
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,960
wicket keeper right now he has all the clips

828
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,079
send etc because we played under 19 together

829
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,679
world cup he sent everything so how he

830
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,520
No, how did you agree then I will go there for trials

831
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,359
I reached RR and I was not there

832
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,200
Motivated to be honest because I wasn't

833
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,000
I didn't even feel like going to the playing state

834
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,480
no i am going away what happened

835
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,879
So then I was nervous that whatever this is

836
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,040
I gave everything to that day, friend

837
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,919
From here we have to do this, that and so many people come

838
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,960
keep

839
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:46,240
I played the first round and it was [ __ ]

840
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,839
very [ __ ] round eye plaid like very useless

841
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,359
There was batting then I was like what is it

842
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,359
okay friend i was packing my bag

843
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,760
From there he was managing the nets etc.

844
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,359
So he said that you have to bat again then

845
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,040
I thought it was okay, I thought again

846
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,119
I have come and seen that I will get my ball

847
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,680
I will play naturally, like I play, I will not

848
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,000
take any burden on me i will play freely

849
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,599
So I went and shot shots and so on

850
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,880
I have come with no expectations at all

851
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,480
All. So when it was auction day I was not

852
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,359
I am expecting that my match status is not there

853
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,119
I am playing. The trial also went well. First Round

854
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,280
It didn’t go well. So do this or give RR

855
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,880
Picked

856
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,040
I

857
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,119
So I was like I was in tears. Mummy

858
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,200
Papa called. Everyone was crying. I

859
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,280
That means I cried too. I didn't know what happened?

860
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,920
I mean, it was a very big day because I

861
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,480
That day papa told me son you should join RR

862
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,680
Picked up. ok but you didn't open everyone's mouth

863
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,119
I stopped it because my dad did so much

864
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,520
I have struggled but was not that well earned

865
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,359
Papa's pension used to come because Papa's

866
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,200
Papa also had to take early retirement

867
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:55,040
Wantri because papa's on duty heart

868
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,880
When I had an attack, I used to get pension from my pension

869
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,920
Everything was going on, does papa know what

870
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,599
Papa used to live, I mean very good

871
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,280
Meaning he used to say what should happen to cricket

872
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,200
It won't be done, does that mean you always kept it easy?

873
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,119
Cricket is done, I will not become a cricketer

874
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,040
What if it doesn't work out? You got a job somewhere

875
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,800
My papers will get me my father in the army

876
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,480
If I was there then I would have been one and not on paper

877
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,640
You will become good at physical cricket

878
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,680
If he plays, he will become good in physical too

879
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,000
If you are physically good then you can also do that

880
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,320
There is a recruitment for those who come as a soldier

881
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,079
If you take it out, something will be alright

882
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,280
If there is no tension then my father says cricket

883
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,119
You play and this will keep you away from dirty things

884
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,800
This groupism will remain and all this

885
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,800
some of this whatever after school college etc

886
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,359
you will stay away from him, you will focus better

887
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I will see when I get picked up

888
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,760
Papa told me while crying that you

889
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,880
Shut everyone's mouth. feeling good today

890
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,160
yes I am feeling proud that my brother

891
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,720
You made my chest broad, so I

892
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,800
felt very good really

893
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:57,200
So I went there for the first time as a

894
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,920
Rajasthan Royals player feels so good

895
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,680
When I got the T-shirt this happened to me

896
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,000
I felt good, I got a training t-shirt

897
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,079
He has practiced a lot there and worked very hard

898
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,400
I used to do legit a lot of hard work, now I'm done

899
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,480
I won't leave you because you love me one by one

900
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,839
Thoughts used to come to me that I wanted to live my old life

901
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,599
I don't want to go where I'm struggling

902
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,839
Am. This is the platform I have got.

903
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,480
I will do my best. full hard work

904
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,880
I will do it. So I worked very hard. Meaning

905
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,680
You won't believe it. I work from 8-8:9 hrs.

906
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,760
I batted once in a day. I completely loved it my friend

907
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,079
I won't leave now. no matter what happen.

908
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,920
So first year I didn't play any match. So

909
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,839
And I am glad. I am very happy

910
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,160
For it's because I didn't get a match. because

911
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,480
That time I thought I was not ready.

912
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,720
I saw what I got in one year

913
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,160
What gets things going. I found out to

914
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,720
What I need to do exactly. like what

915
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,520
This is very fast cricket. you have to be very

916
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,000
Bold Confident. And it is not the case that if

917
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,560
you are not able to do it on that platform then

918
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,119
You go home. Nothing. means like this

919
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,560
it was not like that okay I'll give it to you

920
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,119
I will give. because it was on me that on me

921
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,599
There is no backing. I was not even

922
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,160
Playing State Cricket. So back it up like this

923
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,800
That he is a good player. This is whatever it is

924
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,280
You have one or two chances, if you get them

925
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,200
So. And you have to make them. So

926
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
We had a good team. Now I said that now

927
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,880
How will I get into the team? you have to be

928
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,040
Extraordinary player. i think so

929
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,960
that the right things happened at the right time

930
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,280
To me. That setup is so good.

931
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,280
It is there in Talegaon, a little away from Nagpur

932
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,200
Ahead. So I went there and batted.

933
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,320
There is only ground there. Second Season

934
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,480
It was about to start. then our first match

935
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,800
Was in Guwahati. So I prepare for that

936
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,720
I started doing it. There was a match with Punjab King. I

937
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,359
I am visualizing that this ball is coming to me

938
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,200
They are putting it. Sam is putting Karan. Arshdeep

939
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,359
He is putting it. what can i do this is

940
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,240
So I started this three or four times.

941
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,079
month in advance and 15 days before IPL

942
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,119
We got a day camp in Guwahati.

943
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,720
so i was batting for like se hours 8

944
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,240
Hours. I am going to do it I am going to do it

945
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Am. I had a ghost that I had to do something

946
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,880
I have to do it, I have to do it. so that time impact

947
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,560
Player Was

948
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,800
Introduced. So if the normal playing 11

949
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,400
If it were so, I think I would play too

950
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,960
I can't find it. But dad always says

951
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,520
Impact 11 Impact whatever rule comes is yours

952
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,720
I came here because that rule changed my life

953
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,720
To be honest, I played my first match

954
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:23,200
maybe maybe 28 balls 75 odds runs var

955
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,440
required to me and hetty was playing then

956
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,800
I went, I know I should tell you the truth

957
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,160
It didn't feel like it was mine at all

958
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,320
This is my debut match, I have to be honest to myself

959
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,000
It seems like I belong here and this one matches

960
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,000
I played because I

961
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,920
Listening to the sound of the crowd at airports

962
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,440
Was. Somebody is crying, somebody is screaming,

963
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,920
Somebody is doing this. I am walking.

964
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,520
I'm going in from the exact end.

965
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,480
I put in my right foot and it went in. Crease I

966
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,640
Played leg stickly. This is the whole as it is me

967
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,119
I would visualize it completely. From there he threw the ball

968
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Used to be. So maybe in that match I will

969
00:39:53,119 --> 00:40:01,119
I probably hit 32, 33 not out in 15 balls

970
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,720
There was and we lost that match ah with three more

971
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,880
Four runs.

972
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,040
So that one felt to me like friend came

973
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,440
Belong here I worked so hard for myself

974
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,359
I didn't feel it so much that IPL IPL

975
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,440
IPL because I felt like man I

976
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,359
I belong, I will do it from there

977
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,839
My journey started then in that season

978
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,359
Two-three more good innings came and then from there

979
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,520
It was good that we played Ranji Trophy again

980
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,800
I had opened that one, I am not a

981
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,960
The opener butt was empty right there so this is mine

982
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,599
Don't meet anywhere, what will happen there

983
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,720
If you get out more than this then it was a good

984
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:42,240
season for me then i picked up for india a

985
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,960
Ah, there was a match in South Africa, I scored runs

986
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,400
Against South Africa A then we have an inter

987
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,720
It was a squad match in which all of us were from India A

988
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,880
There was a Vs India match so he came from practice

989
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,560
Before the first South Africa tour, there

990
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,480
I batted very well, Rahul sir

991
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,880
etc. were there and there was also an advantage that

992
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,680
Rahul sir was with me in under 9, we

993
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,520
If he saw it then

994
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:09,760
then the India column

995
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,319
then this then this I was speechless when my

996
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,599
I saw the name I tested the player through

997
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,079
Witch means she's always that baggy blue

998
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,079
I have always thought that I used to visualize that

999
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,720
I am watching BCI TV which is their

1000
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,119
The website is there in it with closed eyes that

1001
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,680
My name is written next to Virat Bhai's name

1002
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,480
and we are in the same squad that thing and

1003
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,640
Exactly that is what happened, I named it that

1004
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,880
Look, I called my dad at 10 in the night.

1005
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,040
It is 11:00 o'clock. papa i got

1006
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,960
If I am selected then which team would I say? I

1007
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,960
Papa India, you are playing. that i was

1008
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,440
Playing India only. I told you papa Virat bhai

1009
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,359
Rohit bhaiya's team. He said, tell me the truth. I

1010
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,400
Yes Papa Khush could not sleep the whole night. These

1011
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:55,280
Then I went there and started two

1012
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,520
I did not play the match. Hmm. then i am third

1013
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,160
I made my debut in the match in Rajkot.

1014
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,920
So before that we were sent home because

1015
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,079
There was probably a gap of 89 days so I went

1016
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,160
I called Zubinder, Sir please do something

1017
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,599
please do it, I want to bat in the cam

1018
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,440
I have to bat a lot if I get a chance

1019
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,240
I won't let you go like this

1020
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,720
I have to do batting, you want

1021
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,960
believe me i played it back in the day

1022
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,119
140 overs and 90 were played on the second day

1023
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,319
overs it was whoop na it felt like that too

1024
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,400
Where is that strain above strain 21

1025
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,440
It does not show that there was 21 strains and recovery

1026
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,680
The next day she was 3% of mine

1027
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,880
But to tell you the truth, I was not able to get up when he

1028
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,720
I think we are not legit after 140 overs

1029
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,200
I picked myself up and was motivating myself

1030
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,920
Come on son, this is the chance you are going to get

1031
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,240
Nobody gets it just like that

1032
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,400
You will play in a population of billions

1033
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,720
Do this and that, son, you will have to do it for yourself

1034
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,599
For parents and coaches who provide support

1035
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,599
If I had to do it for everyone then I went

1036
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,440
I played that over for the first time

1037
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,400
entrance was bowling means that first run

1038
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,319
At the end of my life, I left it

1039
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,560
So I absolutely loved it. I said

1040
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,200
ok if he plays then I will be in that match

1041
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,000
I got out on 46 but I kept it well

1042
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,520
Another good catch made by run out in wicket-keeping

1043
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:18,960
etc. stumping etc. in the next match

1044
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:21,680
Again Dhoni also played in Ranchi

1045
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,319
Everybody was chanting there because

1046
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,319
This is Dhoni's home ground, Dhoni is not even two

1047
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,079
were there but it felt so good

1048
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,200
I mean how much fame he earned and I

1049
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,040
I am playing there and as an Indian

1050
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:38,720
If I am playing the player then that match and I

1051
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,520
Got Man of the Match remember this so I think that

1052
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,599
The whole of India took good notice of you today

1053
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,680
did yes that day but when you were such a strong

1054
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,160
When you are playing a Test innings you know that

1055
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,319
The whole of India is watching this

1056
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,800
I don't know about India, but it is true that in my

1057
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:59,920
Parents are watching at home and are very proud

1058
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,599
Yes, I was just that friend for my country

1059
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,800
I am doing something

1060
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,800
And I mean I am doing Indian jersey so

1061
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,160
I felt very good. means when man of the match

1062
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,440
if i got it then

1063
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,079
Happy for you. Thank you. Just that and this

1064
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,079
This is not the end of the podcast, of course. but this

1065
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,720
I would like to say that this is just the beginning.

1066
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,359
or 100% you said recently that you have UP

1067
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,760
It has also been opened for. Yes. this lower middle

1068
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,920
Batting up the order and opening skills

1069
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,480
Are the sets similar or very different? Both

1070
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,720
They are different. because if you are an opener you

1071
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,680
I have to look for a new ball. if that poor person

1072
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,000
If we talk about the red ball then it is for us

1073
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,680
Let's make an old ball so that we can play

1074
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,760
Because it is the skill set, not that

1075
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,520
There is open ball swing. There is a seam.

1076
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,359
He goes and plays on a fresh wicket.

1077
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,280
We know when our batting comes

1078
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,960
The ball isn't doing that much. This one

1079
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,640
This is the situation. and in the wide ball in the wide ball

1080
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,119
you have to hit with the first ball because you

1081
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,359
Can't take time. you play in power play

1082
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,079
If the fielder is behind then it's a right time to

1083
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,560
take on so that thing is a

1084
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,520
There are different skill sets but

1085
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:11,520
Both are very important to win the match

1086
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:13,920
For us, in my heart, you are through with your career

1087
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,520
You are moulding yourself as a batsman

1088
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,079
For the middle order we will ask you to tell me

1089
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,079
I think there is no such certain position

1090
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,079
It doesn't happen to me what I feel if

1091
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,560
Will someone tell me that I have to open your house tomorrow?

1092
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,040
Because we are playing professional cricket

1093
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,000
If your team needs this and I can

1094
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,839
deliver it so why not i am i am

1095
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,440
happy happy to do it for my team so

1096
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,839
What will happen, at the most I will sing out

1097
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,760
But I have it in me that if I get set

1098
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:41,520
I will try to make the team win and I

1099
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,280
How can I imagine how my team will be now?

1100
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,040
If we win then it's always been like a team goal

1101
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,280
not my like individual goal that I this

1102
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,040
I should do whatever I want, I just need a team

1103
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,720
Because that feeling after making the team win

1104
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:58,560
No, there is nothing unmatched if you hit 100, 200

1105
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,119
Hit me, if the team loses then it's not me, we are the same

1106
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,960
That's the same mentality I've been taught in the NBA.

1107
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,800
You might not remember that Michael Jordan

1108
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,880
How many points is this? Butt rings you must know

1109
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,200
How many rings are there? That too the address of the brands

1110
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,079
How many rings would you have? So that championship

1111
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,240
A team that thing. Your mom and dad never

1112
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,480
Let's talk to you about cricket.

1113
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,000
Actually mommy doesn't have that much knowledge

1114
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,079
About cricket. Now you know the catch

1115
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,880
What happens? out what is that small

1116
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,040
basic basic thing so the same thing means

1117
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,359
His belief is that if I am happy, he is happy

1118
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,880
If I get out then mom

1119
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:34,160
Like my mom and dad, I mean every week

1120
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,359
I mean, I stay in Agra on weekends.

1121
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,119
Papam means we have everything in the village as well as in Agra

1122
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,280
So he always goes to Mathura because

1123
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,359
It is nearby and by going to Banke Bihari

1124
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,920
Because from there when I was making my debut

1125
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:50,319
no then rahul sir told me that you can ask

1126
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,880
Your father to come and hand over the cap to you

1127
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:56,800
Say that your debut cap is the one you will hand

1128
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,280
I handed it over to you so I called Papa

1129
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,680
When I did, my father told me to make my debut

1130
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,440
I am going to Banke Bihari

1131
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,680
what did you mean by that one

1132
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,359
Spiritual that yes he should go and put his hands on you

1133
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,839
What he meant was that you will place your hand on me

1134
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,359
If he does well in his debut then it means that he will

1135
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,079
I liked it, didn't I mean it was very

1136
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,240
grounded, these are the same things that

1137
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,359
I mean it feels good that it is very simple

1138
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:23,440
it is variant and it does not mean that

1139
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:25,440
Even if you have started earning well now

1140
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,319
It does not mean that the son should do this or that.

1141
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,079
Give simple life very good absolutely the best

1142
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,400
talk to me this way because your father is your

1143
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:37,280
Have you been a coach before in life? Yes, no, a lot

1144
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,440
Do you have a lot of connections?

1145
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,760
I wonder what they must be feeling about all this

1146
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,720
whatever is happening in your life

1147
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,640
He is very happy, to tell you the truth, he always

1148
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,119
When we talked earlier it seemed a bit like that

1149
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,359
yes okay there is something because back

1150
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,160
Our neighbors etc. remain off the mind, right?

1151
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,319
Actually I am a Jat so she is from that community

1152
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,720
There are many things, what kind of society do we have?

1153
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,359
But ever since I played for India

1154
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,520
means it stays in very wide area, yes

1155
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:06,160
my son my son means that thing

1156
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,520
No, I mean I like that my

1157
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,839
Papa had told me that look at your son, he is a father

1158
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,720
but the father is known by the name of the son

1159
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:17,359
If that day is not known by name then it will be the pride of the heart

1160
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,680
It happens that look Dhruv's father is going

1161
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,359
My father, don't say such things to me

1162
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,440
It happens on its own that papa yaar such things

1163
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,520
don't do this don't make me so big

1164
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,760
Whatever I am, I am here because of you

1165
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,520
how am I feeling i feel very good

1166
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,440
Is

1167
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,520
I mean, whenever I come into the room, then my

1168
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,119
I have a routine that I come to the room and lie on the bed

1169
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,040
I sleep, I just thank God for

1170
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:42,079
everything i will not ask that friend to me

1171
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,480
Give me this, give me that, whatever you've given me a lot

1172
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,359
I will keep working hard with a true heart

1173
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,160
give me whatever you have to give me as soon as you

1174
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,160
There are two. I am very happy because I have

1175
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,599
Now I feel at that stage,

1176
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,599
I don't think about myself that much

1177
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,040
Am. I think about my parents.

1178
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,520
whenever little things happen

1179
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,920
Because they have struggled so much

1180
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,800
Like papa mummy's age is almost around 60

1181
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:08,079
It's done. He spent at least 50 years of it

1182
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,880
So, I have come out of this struggle. go now when

1183
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,680
I played Under-19 with Papa, Papa

1184
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,000
He was there, he was a deputy. So I paid that.

1185
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,599
So papa also says son for whole life

1186
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,680
I was in debt. whole life means everyone

1187
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,680
This kind of namaste from someone is really very

1188
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,800
I did this because when I used to play cricket

1189
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,599
Papa when there was pension, papa when there was no work

1190
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,960
I used to do this so my father had to take up a job

1191
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:39,839
Because the expenses are not being met. So

1192
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:42,559
Papa opens the gate in a municipal corporation

1193
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,040
Papa had a pistol because he was in the army

1194
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,599
So papa one license is for someone

1195
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,400
I was a bodyguard, so whenever I was from Delhi

1196
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,920
If anyone came back after playing a match or something, he would sit there

1197
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,520
I used to stay with Papa because Papa's

1198
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,000
When the duty was over we would go home on our bike

1199
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,319
We used to go there because it was a municipal corporation

1200
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,640
The stand was there and Papa's office was there, so I

1201
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,520
I saw my father literally opening the door

1202
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,800
I will tell you the truth about myself at that time.

1203
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:09,040
I mean I didn't tell my father but I came home

1204
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,760
I cried a little because I felt that Papa was there for me

1205
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,880
What are you doing? So to me it was that

1206
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,800
No friend, now papa means the one who

1207
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,119
He opens the door directly to everyone's father

1208
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,520
A message comes that Naimi Papa's name is

1209
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,839
Singh is Nemi you have done a lot of this

1210
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,240
My father had no idea what to do with such great men

1211
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:30,079
When I used to open their gate, I was getting their call

1212
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,960
If yes, then papa says that means he comes every day

1213
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,960
they mean it like this

1214
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:38,480
you know what i think 10 years

1215
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,400
Later we will not say that Nemi Uncle Dhruv

1216
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,000
Nemi uncle is doing something for brother

1217
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,400
Actually I was doing something for India.

1218
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,440
100% he dedicated his whole life to India

1219
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,559
I have given it. I also saw his son.

1220
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,000
how does it feel dude

1221
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,920
All? think about it because

1222
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Before the start of the podcast we went to Mumbai

1223
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,480
We were talking about glamour. I am

1224
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,280
Sure, you can find Bollywood stars.

1225
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,800
You know cricket is on top in our country

1226
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,960
Buddy.

1227
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:09,520
It is above Bollywood. cricket is religion then

1228
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:12,160
Meaning People Worship Cricket. from there to here

1229
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,000
How is your mind processing all this?

1230
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,680
I am not processing it. I told you

1231
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,599
that I have to take you along one day because

1232
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,280
Whenever you think ahead, you are a

1233
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,040
You think negatively that friend this happened, that happened

1234
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,520
Went. Is it okay? Whatever happens will be seen. Meaning

1235
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,599
There is acceptance, whatever happens will be seen. now one

1236
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:30,000
Establishment that life is good

1237
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,119
Is. Mom and Dad have had a good life.

1238
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,079
So now I don't want to think about that

1239
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,400
Financially, all this is good

1240
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,319
It is kept by the grace of God. now to me

1241
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,480
I have to concentrate only on cricket. Now he

1242
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,520
There isn't a side noise like this friend

1243
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,359
That, that, it's just cricket now. We are now that

1244
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,599
I think that those who are over the periods

1245
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,760
There has been a change. Now it's only cricket. Last

1246
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,920
For the last one year it's only cricket or not now

1247
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,160
I have to focus on cricket only.

1248
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,480
There is nothing. my cricket my parents

1249
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:02,559
And the one above. Not just wow, Dhoni bhai is also the same

1250
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,720
They say. Focus on this. everything else

1251
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,280
Will follow. Yes, that was what he said

1252
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,520
that if you focus on cricket everything

1253
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,240
is by

1254
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:15,520
Product Everything will come to you Fame Money

1255
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,400
and it is simple if you play well on yourself

1256
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:21,599
Sponsors will come and you will get a good contract

1257
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,880
If it happens then why not is the meaning behind that thing

1258
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:28,319
Don't run away, let him come, this is a simple thing

1259
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,880
That's why he was a legend and he is a legend

1260
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,760
that he showed simplicity and simply

1261
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,599
By doing simplicity over and over and over

1262
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,480
Because sometimes I get bored too

1263
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,880
is that friend no friend he is doing the same thing

1264
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:45,359
yes but it is very beneficial

1265
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,839
We mean to do it as difficult and boring as life

1266
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,960
Yes, the success will be that much higher

1267
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:54,160
It will be high, right, like you podcast.

1268
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:57,680
Your field is different, mine is cricket, whatever

1269
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,760
isn't it, it's around it, this is the thing I'm

1270
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,160
I won't do anything I won't have fun

1271
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,960
Friend, I should do this because of this thing

1272
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,800
thanks to you i am sitting here actually today

1273
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,440
If I do that with this thing, friend, it's okay

1274
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,200
it's not that i am scared of it

1275
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,680
I am telling you the truth, I am very scared

1276
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,760
I guess if I don't train well

1277
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,400
If I don't do this properly then I will feel guilty

1278
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,559
It stays there friend, today I did eight wraps in it

1279
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,839
Why weren't 10 raps written in the program?

1280
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,599
I think he should do this or not

1281
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,040
No friend, I am scared of the one above

1282
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,520
Friend, he is watching that, no one is seeing

1283
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,160
if he did this then I will always

1284
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,920
I'll try anything for this thing

1285
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,480
I will not let this harm cricket

1286
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,359
I have made one of my own. So, this thing

1287
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,800
Let there be harm. such mentality young

1288
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,559
Players don't always have it.

1289
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,880
You don't have to say anything. this is mine

1290
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,720
The world of cricket has observation.

1291
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,800
But I have seen that Hardik's

1292
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,800
Mentality is exactly like this. Yes. Peak

1293
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,760
Dhawan's mentality is exactly like this. Who

1294
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,599
it's your mentality and not like go far but

1295
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,160
Stay in the present, stay boring, routines

1296
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,000
Follow me. Growth mentality, right?

1297
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,040
Because all the legends that have been created are of sons

1298
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,680
This has been the mentality. because that's the thing

1299
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,119
No brother, it means that she is giving you everything

1300
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,720
Why do we have to have fun with this

1301
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,960
because in australia in england

1302
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:17,280
Cricket may be different and cricket is just

1303
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,839
a support for them but for us no one knows what

1304
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,920
This is our religion, this is our religion, we go

1305
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,960
Why do you go with your feet touching the ground?

1306
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,960
Brother, this is our land of work, we should go

1307
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,440
It means we are going to war brother

1308
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,920
We will go and worship him, our bats

1309
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,839
by kissing him completely, by doing it like this

1310
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,920
I keep it such that if my friend touches my foot then it will be just like this

1311
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:39,920
If you do it then it is the same thing and people will say

1312
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,480
is it friend no friend cricket is just a spot

1313
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,960
So why not do it like cricket?

1314
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,599
Cricket is not just yes Cricket is not just

1315
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,119
a sport and we live in india and we are

1316
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:54,880
Grateful that we live in India because

1317
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,559
BCCI one of the richest boat right if I

1318
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,880
I would have been playing cricket somewhere else

1319
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,280
I don't have all the opportunities here

1320
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,520
But population is very difficult in India

1321
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,680
to play. If you get there, you're settled

1322
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,280
For the rest of your life. so we are

1323
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,640
fortunate that we are under BCCI maybe

1324
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,599
Three-four generations are also settled. his address

1325
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:18,240
No, I did not think that far ahead. no don't think

1326
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,960
Brother. No. want you to always be Dhruv

1327
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,800
100%. among young cricketers

1328
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,359
Sometimes financial matters arise

1329
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:29,920
Investments Savings or Even One Layer

1330
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,800
Deeper here basically we are talking about discipline

1331
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,520
We are disciplined, such things happen

1332
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,760
A lot happens, a lot happens, everything happens together

1333
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,280
Let's talk about where to invest

1334
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,280
real estate these these these these things

1335
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,920
no, even if it is a little distracting

1336
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,440
I have given everything to my father,

1337
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,880
My money also comes from my father's account

1338
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,200
I have given it. Meaning, it is my account. Father

1339
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,760
I have given it to. Papa, do whatever you want.

1340
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,920
And I have an account. So what I am in

1341
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,160
I do what I do. First this is mine

1342
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,960
When I had no money I thought this was it

1343
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,720
Dude lewthon bag rx watch. then his

1344
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,520
Later I realised that this is all

1345
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,920
It is a materialistic thing. I gave you this myself

1346
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,799
But I have noticed that after 15-20 days the same thing happens

1347
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,599
She doesn't excite you that much. So

1348
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,520
I have started recently. I'm somewhere

1349
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,599
I go for a walk carrying his memories with me

1350
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:26,799
I am coming. culture food everything

1351
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:29,079
wow we are showing experiences

1352
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:32,079
experiences when you

1353
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:36,079
If you were in your 70s or 80s, what would you say?

1354
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:39,680
that friend what do you call my old age

1355
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:42,319
Sold my youth in order to buy it.

1356
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,640
So that is the thing that I enjoy myself.

1357
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,799
I would do it and I would not have enjoyed it, Louis Whitten

1358
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,119
bag this that that you are not enjoying any

1359
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:51,599
And he is enjoying Luthon's bag, this is him

1360
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,240
If you want to be in that thing then I am

1361
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,480
Sure you have to do it but you should do it yourself

1362
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,799
The realization that my friend, I have done something

1363
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,799
I have brought some memories and anytime you

1364
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,640
You're sitting there wondering if you know what that person is

1365
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,880
That thing which excites happened there

1366
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,319
isn't there nothing around it because you

1367
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,559
You live in India and your culture is Indian

1368
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,799
It's different, if you go somewhere else the culture there is different

1369
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,599
Then you would enjoy learning something new

1370
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:16,400
For. It's the biggest lesson that you get out of

1371
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:20,640
Should go for a trip. lots of things how to

1372
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Deal with different types of people and their food.

1373
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,880
It may never feel good but when you try it

1374
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,960
why is that so? Ask about them. So

1375
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:30,880
That thing looks really nice. that all of these

1376
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:34,720
Bag watches are not a tool for healing wounds

1377
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,760
Is. Yes. Whatever that is in childhood, yes. Injuries

1378
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,880
My heart said yes. She fills them up butt 15

1379
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,839
really over in the day because a one

1380
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:48,400
Incidentally, when I needed an iPhone

1381
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:51,280
it was a 7 plus so when I

1382
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,520
I was playing cricket and I was in Noida

1383
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,160
I will tell you the situation as well

1384
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,599
Let me tell you how I reached Noida

1385
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,520
Played under 14 for UP so much in Agra

1386
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:05,200
There was no opportunity, it was already there

1387
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,760
playing well and if you want to improve

1388
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,920
If you want to do it then you have to do it with them

1389
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,079
who are playing there at a good level,

1390
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,400
You play well. because i am already

1391
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,920
Playing good among all. so where am I from

1392
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,720
Should I improve? I don't have anything like that

1393
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,640
that I look up to someone and try to become like him

1394
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,040
Have a desire for it. So I thought that man

1395
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,440
I will go to Noida. It was a very tough decision

1396
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:29,200
Be honest. So I made mom and dad

1397
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:32,000
how to do it. because papaam is on that stage

1398
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,920
I had understood that he would only play cricket. So I

1399
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,559
I told you papa's job was security

1400
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,720
The guard one.

1401
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:44,000
So papa used to come, mummy used to take care of everything

1402
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:45,640
Some. So what did Papa do then? to mommy

1403
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,720
no with me noida

1404
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,400
Sent food and drinks. And at that time I was

1405
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,240
Very happy. That's ok. You will get food.

1406
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,720
It's time. I will practice. at that time

1407
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,559
What would papa be doing? I think so. Now

1408
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:00,799
Who would cook the food? It was sister. didi's too

1409
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,920
There was coaching etc. Who would have made it? I

1410
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,079
How did you do it? And my mother stayed with me for two and a half hours

1411
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,119
Year.

1412
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:13,760
When I reached there the apartment

1413
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:16,880
The one I had taken was Gauss's. Gaus is a society

1414
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,200
was his. Why am I mentioning its name

1415
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,960
I will tell you about the Gars later. Gauss's

1416
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:26,319
Its rent was Rs 7000. It was a lot, friend. Truth

1417
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,599
Let me tell you, it was very difficult. how no how

1418
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:32,960
Did. Then I joined the academy there

1419
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,040
Noida Wonders. The coach there was Phool Sir. so I

1420
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,359
Started playing. I started

1421
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,440
There was also his fee for scoring runs etc.

1422
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,880
He hasn't charged me any fees till now

1423
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,599
Because I was playing well. They

1424
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,079
He supported me a lot. from there my

1425
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:49,119
The journey started. Then from there I again

1426
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:52,079
Revived, played Under 14 and then Under 16. Then

1427
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,559
Played Under 19. I had a break through season.

1428
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,799
Then I scored three centuries. then mine

1429
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,880
The name came in the series as a captain Asia Cup.

1430
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,799
So we won that Asia Cup. in the World Cup

1431
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,359
The name came up. And I was scoring runs. So

1432
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:07,040
My journey started from there.

1433
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:08,359
Then after that, Covid happened. all of us

1434
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:13,680
come back

1435
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:15,359
Fell. Then came back. Then from there IPL

1436
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,119
It was going on. So it wasn't closed. Dubai

1437
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:20,079
IPL was going on in that. so i don't pick

1438
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:22,000
It happened. I found it very strange because

1439
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,400
Friends, all those who were playing with me. and I

1440
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,960
And I was vice captain of the team under 19

1441
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,880
World Cup. If I am not picked then to me

1442
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,720
It felt very strange, friend, what should I do? so I

1443
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,559
I was very much broken, what did that mean, friend

1444
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,240
I mean I have only one child and not the boys who are with me

1445
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,280
He is playing IPL and got a contract

1446
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,280
Everything is there so I thought what should I do friend

1447
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,920
I talked to papa and asked what happened to playing

1448
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,160
problem then there is state etc also in proper way

1449
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,440
I was not playing because if you are from UP

1450
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,599
There is a lot of competition where you are playing

1451
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,520
It's not about how good a player you are

1452
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,680
How soon does your time come?

1453
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,319
When do you get an opportunity, it is when you get it

1454
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:01,920
I didn't have that much

1455
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:03,839
So then when that trial thing happened then I

1456
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:08,799
The selection was done. then after covid

1457
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:12,160
I did not have to come back to Noida again. so for some reason

1458
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:14,240
I could not go to Phool Sir. then i

1459
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,079
Went to an academy. Divyansh is my friend

1460
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,200
Joshi. I asked him if he lives in Noida.

1461
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:22,000
Brother, I need an academy there. So

1462
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,000
There is an est public school. This is Afzal sir. Then

1463
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,520
From there I get the right guy at the right time.

1464
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,960
found. He was the coach. He helped a lot

1465
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,119
Curry. They searched my apartment etc.

1466
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,440
saw. Come on. So when I love him so much

1467
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,760
it wasn't that much worth the money because good

1468
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,760
I had earned it in under 9 so I am doing it

1469
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,640
Was. I was just taking care of it. So

1470
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,960
From there I started the journey again.

1471
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,880
So this is how my journey started from there

1472
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,079
Hui. Then came to Noida. Then that Gauss's I

1473
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,599
That's why I was telling you when he sold Gauss for Rs. 7000

1474
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,599
It was the first apartment. my mommy did

1475
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:54,880
He said, wow, there are houses like this too. or two rooms

1476
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:57,599
One lobby, this one, and the other, on the 17th floor.

1477
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,440
Oh wow what did he say that there is a house like this

1478
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:02,240
That our little house in Agra never looked like this

1479
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,000
I haven't seen so many buses passing by or

1480
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,200
I saw on TV that there were apartments too

1481
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,440
There are sky scapes etc. taken there

1482
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:13,559
7000 so Gus took Gauss's now he is back of the

1483
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,119
The bat is mine

1484
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:21,680
Gars wow and I am the brand ambassador of

1485
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:23,520
Gorse oh so that's the thing that means when

1486
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,240
Do you know where and how it is written

1487
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:30,160
it wouldn't happen hmm hm

1488
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:33,119
I miss my teenage days very much

1489
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:36,240
I have struggled because I never had to travel by auto

1490
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:38,400
Papa had an Active one and he paid on EMI

1491
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:42,079
She had sent it to me, I used to go by auto myself

1492
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:44,400
brother it is very good than etc. i mean I am I

1493
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:46,079
I am grateful that this happened to me and whatever

1494
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,119
I think he is playing at a higher level

1495
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:52,079
They all have stories. maybe if all that

1496
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,400
It would not have happened then you would have been worth 14 crores

1497
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,920
I am not able to handle the contract mentally.

1498
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,440
And if that hadn't happened, I would have thought

1499
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,720
He also gets a contract worth 14 crores

1500
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:04,240
No. I am a friend this is worth 14 crores

1501
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:07,280
There are talks of contract, right? I have come

1502
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:10,640
I don't believe this, I know that we

1503
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:15,920
RR has also done something in your mentality

1504
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:17,680
We have seen that they have talked about maintenance

1505
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,280
He also made some contribution

1506
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:23,920
hogi hum like there is a lot of belief around

1507
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:26,559
You are I am and now you have to know a little bit

1508
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,079
I am sure you believe that you are

1509
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,319
The pressure is not processing. For you

1510
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,839
There is no pressure. You might infact have strength

1511
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:34,000
It is available. It gives me strength. Right

1512
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,480
What is the environment of Tarar? because some

1513
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,880
So that must be the reason why Rihan Parag is so

1514
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,599
There has been a big bounce back. Jaiswal got so much

1515
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,920
Growth has been achieved. You get out of the RR setup.

1516
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,440
something is going very right which every

1517
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,280
We can't say no to a franchise. But

1518
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,440
This should definitely be the highlight for RR

1519
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,680
She goes. And RR has always been such a

1520
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,960
It has been a franchise that has always attracted youngsters

1521
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:58,640
It promotes. Still this time that splendor

1522
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:02,079
Picked up Suryavanshi. why are we in them

1523
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:04,720
something looks good but you have to be very

1524
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:07,359
Flexible so you can do whatever they say

1525
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:10,720
It will happen because he knows how to be a cricketer

1526
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:13,039
Is made. You go to 2013 and buy a 13

1527
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,880
Year old cricketer's mindset when

1528
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,799
I started playing cricket wow yes and

1529
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,200
He would really get an IPL contract

1530
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:23,520
Meaning where is cricket going and meaning

1531
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,640
How much talent is there in cricket?

1532
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,720
It seems to him that Vaibhav is not feeling normal

1533
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,440
I mean we talked about it completely brother how are I

1534
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,799
good and this is normal and he is very

1535
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:38,640
good batsman like i have seen him

1536
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:41,839
It is like something, how are we Jaiswal, age

1537
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:43,760
A teammate? jaiswal and ryan ryan are my

1538
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:46,000
Like bestest friend. means whatever they

1539
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,480
Yes, it means that the three of us will tease each other

1540
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,319
They keep pulling everything. Jaiswal means the one who

1541
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,640
He is here today because of his hard work

1542
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,720
I still remember that we played under 19

1543
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,440
World Cup Together. Then he would have batted like this

1544
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,039
I was really angry, friend,

1545
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,920
Why do you bat so much, friend? we too are

1546
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,160
I will bat. That means she knows that she came

1547
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,000
Want to do it. Then he has to do one more

1548
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:10,680
I will do it. When he gets out and works hard

1549
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,520
Is. Same with Ryan. People call Ryan a little

1550
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:16,799
I mean on social media they think that hey this

1551
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:19,680
It is like that. But he is such a genuine heart

1552
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:22,720
That person is me, I am my go to person

1553
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,839
Big. Meaning, whatever the matter is, we talk about it.

1554
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:29,119
humble caring helping means so good

1555
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:32,079
Meaning, his style of playing is different.

1556
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,799
He just plays with aggression. and it's ok

1557
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,760
When you are in the ground you will see your team

1558
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:39,839
If you want to win the match then you should show aggression

1559
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,000
Or show me anything if that helps you.

1560
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:44,000
if it is there then it's ok and you have to

1561
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,760
accept it even if he is not able to do it

1562
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,559
Doing for the team so I think that

1563
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,480
Ryan Jaiswal Sanju Bhaiya me and this Vaibhav

1564
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:56,880
if came

1565
01:05:53,480 --> 01:06:01,039
We stayed grounded and thought good and did good

1566
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:04,240
I mean I practiced and everything is good

1567
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,760
If that remains, we will continue to give 100% RR for each of the three years.

1568
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,640
of cycle by winning championship in it

1569
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,720
I will give.

1570
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:14,079
We have played with Jaiswal before also when he

1571
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,960
Were you in UP? No, I did not play then. I

1572
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,799
Started with him from Under 19 itself. Yes. You

1573
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,039
Now it seems that the mentality of both of you is not the same

1574
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:23,599
To me. Like I feel like you both say

1575
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,039
Are cut from the same cloth. Meaning of DNA Beans

1576
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,520
It belongs to both of you. because he also has a lot of

1577
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:31,520
I remained struggling. Means there was a lot of struggle

1578
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,680
In his life too. So it is the same thing.

1579
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,200
I mean even if I get out

1580
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,559
Everything happens, I explain it to him.

1581
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,920
If he gets out, I will explain it to him

1582
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,680
Am. We are a mean pillar. Meaning

1583
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,799
Both of us were on Australia tour. both of us

1584
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,240
were talking to each other that friend you

1585
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:45,839
because if you are getting out then I

1586
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,760
Jaiswal seems like he did so well

1587
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:50,720
Is. I understood him, I always explained it to him

1588
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,960
Am. He explains to me that from one inning

1589
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:55,359
nothing is happening. Means you as a cricketer

1590
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,039
One innings is enough for us. We sometimes

1591
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,200
He goes immediately. But to ourselves we must

1592
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:02,640
You have to stand it up, friend, it doesn't matter

1593
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,960
This is the next chance. because we mean

1594
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,119
It is not the case that since childhood no one

1595
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,880
He told us that there are five to six chances of doing it.

1596
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,559
Give. Then it becomes easy, right? one on you

1597
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,520
There is a chance, I will have to do it. If you won't do it then no one

1598
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,039
And there is more. So that mentality is still with us

1599
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,559
Is. But we know that if we make one or two

1600
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,799
If the match is not good then we will have

1601
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,720
The surroundings are so good. They will back us.

1602
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:22,160
But our mentality doesn't go away

1603
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,000
Is. We feel that a match is going to be bad, friend

1604
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,160
We should not get dropped. we are totally negative

1605
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,559
They go away. so the same thing we

1606
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:31,839
Keep explaining to others. this is probably the answer

1607
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:34,720
It is a speciality of the state. of every place of every place

1608
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:39,599
because if you look at the population,

1609
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:42,400
60-70% of its population plays cricket

1610
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,079
That too professionally and beyond that on the street

1611
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,280
Almost everyone plays cricket.

1612
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:50,240
You must also be playing cricket. so how not

1613
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,960
will be? Now tell me this Vaibhav Suryavanshi 13 years

1614
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,839
Would he have batted so well at the age of 13?

1615
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,839
So we

1616
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:00,240
This means a very competitive sport

1617
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:02,000
very much very much and you are very lucky

1618
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,640
yes if you are playing at a higher level

1619
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,280
you are very lucky your blessings are good

1620
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,880
You will always be loyal to your parents and God

1621
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,200
If you work hard then you will get everything

1622
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,160
If synchronization happens then you can proceed further

1623
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,880
yes sashasvi and you go for a walk together

1624
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,040
yes I will take him to Australia

1625
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:23,199
I will take him along with me. yes that means ever

1626
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:25,040
If you take me then we mean cafe cafe

1627
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,440
We really enjoy hopping. Coffee

1628
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,759
Coffee is ok so I would try it

1629
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,920
I live. This is very different

1630
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,080
We both have a good bond. what things

1631
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,759
Does it happen in cafes? Nothing in the cafes.

1632
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,440
Anything we talk about is normal. I

1633
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,679
I have told him this rule. Brother Cricket

1634
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,679
Please don't talk about it. yes know this

1635
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,600
Was. please don't talk about cricket

1636
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,920
because every time cricket cricket cricket

1637
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,679
Cricket you seem like a spark to me

1638
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,120
You forget it. There is a spark, isn't there one

1639
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,839
It feels like a good excitement that cricket

1640
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,400
Cricket starts to become boring that you

1641
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:56,159
Are you getting bored talking about this

1642
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,159
Are you doing this? Wake up tomorrow morning and pick up the bat again.

1643
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,560
If I have to bat then I think today

1644
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:02,080
We will talk about normal things and we have made a rule

1645
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,480
Brother, we will only talk about cricket

1646
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,279
No, we need to tune out like this. Yes

1647
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:09,520
is a must. You feel very fresh

1648
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:12,640
It is necessary because there is an excitement

1649
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,880
No, I am batting like you

1650
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,480
I scored runs today. Now go and bat tomorrow too

1651
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,799
I will do it, so I am pushing myself

1652
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,400
Am. I am not enjoying and enjoying

1653
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:22,960
It is very important in cricket. and Annie

1654
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:26,000
Sport or don't mind me asking. These

1655
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:28,960
It is a very long question but the beginning of the question

1656
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,279
I will do it from here. how far did you study

1657
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,960
Was? I have studied till 12th. And

1658
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,560
I have completed my first year of BA.

1659
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,199
I don't have time for the second year right now.

1660
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,199
I got it because you are thinking of some exam

1661
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,960
What about the exam? Yes. now to me

1662
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,719
You will have to give exams, right? It's not like this now

1663
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,319
It will happen automatically. Now get this much window

1664
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,920
I am not able to do it because IPL happens. Now

1665
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,440
I am an international because since I am an international

1666
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,799
Have you started playing, right? So it's time

1667
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:55,440
I can't find it. Hopefully no

1668
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:57,280
I will keep playing.

1669
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,080
I am shocked that you are thinking about studying

1670
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,480
had been. Yes. Yes. Wow. what is this feeling

1671
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,199
Is? Nothing. It feels good now that it's like this

1672
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,640
He said that he is 12th pass and 10th pass and one

1673
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:10,239
The graduate said that the graduate to me

1674
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,840
I have to do graduation and that's all I care about, friend

1675
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,080
You can also talk about life from the world of cricket

1676
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,560
You learn about it. very much, very much

1677
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,360
More. Human life, life is a sport.

1678
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,159
Meaning

1679
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:25,120
I mean the biggest beautiful coat I always

1680
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:27,440
I think. This too shall pass. if you make 100

1681
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,679
had been. Tomorrow morning someone else will wake up and do 100.

1682
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,159
People will forget. And you are hitting zero. Tomorrow

1683
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,560
After hearing this you will get up and make it 100. People Zero

1684
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:37,360
You will forget it. So it means there is nothing like that.

1685
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,199
Life goes on, goes on, goes on. just that

1686
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,840
I don't think about life. taking it so seriously

1687
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:45,840
It isn't there at all. Be normal, be good, be the best

1688
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:49,679
Talk nicely. Just Hardik Krunal

1689
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:53,040
Both of them together told me one thing that

1690
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:57,600
Give me the feeling that a cricketer grows

1691
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,600
If definitely because of hard work we

1692
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,840
Discipline and those are all factors. Butt another

1693
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,920
This is a factor which is not talked about much. And

1694
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,560
That is growing outside of the world of

1695
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:10,080
Cricket also. 100% the people around you

1696
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,080
if you want to gain knowledge then this

1697
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:15,600
what is the link according to you because

1698
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:18,880
You are a growing cricketer, please explain this to me

1699
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:21,040
From your point of view, cricket is a good thing.

1700
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,800
It's a game we play, everybody knows everything

1701
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,040
You are playing cricket but outside

1702
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,360
Earlier you were talking about investing, so that is the

1703
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:30,280
someone is talking about this thing, meet someone

1704
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:33,600
did we go or did we go to some event, someone there

1705
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:36,159
But one good candidate of any specific field

1706
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,000
I found the guy, I talked to him and from there

1707
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:41,920
you grow because if you play

1708
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,560
good cricket na you will get good links that

1709
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,719
found a good doctor found a good lawyer

1710
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,719
or do we get any meaning from them

1711
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,840
to learn how this works friend

1712
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:53,520
That if you are keen to learn it doesn't mean that

1713
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,840
You should be interested, right?

1714
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,960
I can't tell you that friend, what kind of work are you doing?

1715
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,920
you do it, you should be interested and everyone

1716
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:05,199
Nor do we have a different way of looking at the world

1717
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:07,360
ask everybody what like let them talk and

1718
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:10,320
Who knows, something like this might click for you

1719
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:12,480
Help us, we are always happy with cricket

1720
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,640
The psychological game is also very much of its own

1721
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,800
If psychology is made strong then in cricket

1722
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:21,280
There are many benefits to you

1723
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:23,120
Meaning you don't have to be a neutral thing

1724
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,120
The day it goes away I feel that

1725
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,840
A lot of things become easier if you

1726
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:30,719
The performance didn't happen, you are just like this, right?

1727
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:33,920
So I think that it is a pause

1728
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,679
in life that yes it's ok it's ok

1729
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,719
means accept it yes okay yes what

1730
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,480
This happened and it does not mean that at the time of low

1731
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:43,920
Don't take so much at the time of high

1732
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:46,400
don't get high, stay cool and enjoy

1733
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,320
Meaning in IPL teams or Indian cricket

1734
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,199
Like the role of a psychologist in the team too

1735
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:53,679
It does stay there, right? Yes, it often gets kicked in when

1736
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:56,719
is their role meaning if the player's mental

1737
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,960
If his health is deteriorating then yes,

1738
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,840
Meaning everything is related to cricket

1739
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,320
performance performance we are getting

1740
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:07,040
It is not happening, then he feels that this is

1741
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,480
But then I think that's a good thing

1742
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:12,239
There should be a psychologist in the team, this or that, but you yourself

1743
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,400
you will become your own for me because you know

1744
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:16,719
that's what you're thinking if you

1745
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,560
You're a psychologist, no matter how much you

1746
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,480
You will not tell me, I will talk to you so openly

1747
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,960
I can't even find what I'm thinking

1748
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:26,560
because one fear is that the friend will

1749
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:29,199
Will you judge me and no one will accept this

1750
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,520
no i am transparent neither you

1751
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:34,239
You are your own best teacher

1752
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:37,120
You can make the resolution by talking to yourself

1753
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:39,840
You can resolve that thing? so to me

1754
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,840
it seems that the same thing is that you take your

1755
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,239
Time. No one is telling me to do this or that

1756
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,080
do it. If you are my best friend and me

1757
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:50,000
You are my guardian. So I will talk to

1758
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,159
From you. That area should not be small.

1759
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,840
Whatever I feel. inner circle. inner circle

1760
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:57,199
It should be very small. if as big as

1761
01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:00,159
If it goes away it will be that much sad.

1762
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:04,159
Your inner circle is in cricket only. No

1763
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:07,760
I have two friends - my mom and dad.

1764
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:10,520
One is a touch, one is Shivam and one is a part and

1765
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:14,719
Whenever Rinku Bhaiya etc. but most of the

1766
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:16,719
time i talk to my friend sparsh then that

1767
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,440
Me to him because we have been together since childhood.

1768
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:22,800
Sparsh and Shivam have been together since childhood. like me

1769
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:24,400
I would probably say 10-11 years because it's very

1770
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,120
All things happen. you from your parents

1771
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,360
I am not able to talk. and its not that you do

1772
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:32,080
I can't do it. you can but you're older now

1773
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,080
You are done. He makes Papa and Mummy so sad

1774
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,159
I don't want to do it because it is somewhat emotional

1775
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,199
Things happen brother, this is not happening friend

1776
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:42,239
He will abuse me once or twice. Now it's ok right

1777
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:45,440
What happened to that thing and some other things

1778
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:48,800
You have to talk to the parents. We

1779
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:51,120
I talked about Rinku bhaiya. yes we are flat

1780
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:54,320
Mets. Yes. yes we have one in greater noida

1781
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,840
We live together. still you yes still you

1782
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,480
Are you talking about cricketer Rinku Singh?

1783
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,080
Yes cricketer Rinku Singh wow why?

1784
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,000
Because we have to motivate each other.

1785
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,400
No, we practice at one place.

1786
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,280
Everything comes from Aligarh. I Come

1787
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,600
From Agra it is nearby. when i was young

1788
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,840
I used to come to see him and used to watch the Aligarh matches.

1789
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,560
Brother, I play a lot of class. What brother

1790
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:17,600
We have to bat like this if we stay together now

1791
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,080
means very genuine hearted person and

1792
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:23,280
Both of Bajrangbali are very beautiful

1793
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:25,920
The elder ones stay together, we do everything

1794
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,600
And the biggest thing is that everyone says no

1795
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,920
If you stay with Rinku Singh then you will be interested in cricket

1796
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,800
Things will happen, I will try that too

1797
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,159
Neither that guy nor I, I said brother I

1798
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,159
What can I do for myself in cricket?

1799
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:37,920
I don't know, he is not able to tell me brother

1800
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:40,320
He is doing it right, he is doing it well

1801
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,280
means it is so easy doesn't it mean that it is your

1802
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,679
I am my own man and very good, very good

1803
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,199
He is a good guy, he is very humble, that means he

1804
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:51,040
Why have you got success?

1805
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:54,400
I have seen the same struggle, everything and yes, self

1806
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:56,159
belief self believe this is our hard work

1807
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,080
it keeps making me think that if we don't

1808
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,640
We are able to do it and we try like this

1809
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:03,280
no it is not happening let it go and we will do it again

1810
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:06,400
how long will we do it, it won't happen because the same

1811
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:10,080
thing isn't it where we're coming from

1812
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:12,239
I don't want to go now, I have to go further and from there

1813
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:15,760
Our family's thing is also connected

1814
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:18,239
She also motivates people like us a lot.

1815
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:21,679
Human beings have energy, right? Yes. like you

1816
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:24,239
I brought out that warrior energy. A

1817
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:26,159
Well, cities also have energy. Yes. So

1818
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:29,040
How do you like the energy of Bombay?

1819
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:30,880
I haven't come to Bombay that far. Matches

1820
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,960
I come because of this but very lively

1821
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,440
It seems so. People always look at me

1822
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,280
Let's go. Meaning there is only one city 8

1823
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,840
After 9:00 pm you moon. but it is like this here

1824
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:42,719
But it doesn’t happen. People are so busy,

1825
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,480
Is career oriented. Feel it in stadiums too

1826
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,800
It happens.

1827
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,960
Every stadium has a different energy. Mumbai

1828
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:52,159
Meaning what is the energy of Wankhede?

1829
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:55,960
When is Wankhede's unreal? So that rally

1830
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:59,600
It was unreal, still our team would have settled down

1831
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:01,280
Is. So different level means crazy loyal fan

1832
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,040
meaning we are very fortunate that we are

1833
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,120
Playing for India. Of the Wankhede crowd

1834
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:08,800
What remains of energy? She is very good.

1835
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:12,239
It means a lot when people say things like Vande

1836
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:15,199
Mataram means the crowd comes. really mean

1837
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:17,280
You have such good energy, don't you?

1838
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:20,320
you will go if you cast a particular spell

1839
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:22,320
are you cheating on me this is so good

1840
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:25,440
I feel it, I mean, really, very much

1841
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:28,159
good vibes means if you go to a couple of stadiums

1842
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,360
If you say so, Wankhede is one of them in which the game

1843
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:33,760
it feels so good

1844
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:36,320
I feel the love of the audience very much

1845
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,480
I feel very much like this is the end of the podcast

1846
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,880
no way

1847
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:43,440
I would like to tell you one thing in between

1848
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:46,640
Yes, friend, those who understand cricket

1849
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,719
No, the fans who are still not convinced with Test cricket

1850
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:51,280

Is. So just be you because 100%. I Feel

1855
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:06,719
You are already becoming a pillar of India

1856
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:08,800
And the strength of that pillar will increase further.

1857
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,679
time is full with as much time as is needed

1858
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,920
I can't talk about it 100% tomorrow

1859
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,080
Yes, do a little about Abhishek Sharma

1860
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,719
talking in

1861
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:23,679
The best innings I have seen till date

01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:28,400
how is he playing me no he always does

1864
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,560
He plays with it like this. now the thing is that tomorrow

1865
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:32,400
I have played such a good innings till date

1866
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,040
I have never played such a good innings sitting in front.

1867
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,600
Really mean those who were batting from the East

1868
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:41,199
no proper cricketing

1869
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:43,440
shots to we were being selfish ki yaar 34

1870
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:46,880
I should score a century, I should score a century at 34

1871
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:51,120
The record will be broken but the way he played

1872
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,040
Incredible hmm nice to watch how is he

1873
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,760
deep inside i felt he was also going to

1874
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:59,120
Have a big IPL this year is very cool

1875
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:03,360
he is a guy, if you ever talk to him then

1876
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:06,000
He has only one mistake every day, Paaji ji

1877
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:09,920
Yesterday I asked him if he should bat

1878
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,400
Hey, I told you that if the day passes then it means

1879
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:16,080
He is a very cool guy, he lives in the present

1880
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:19,360
Absolutely awesome we uvipa copy paste mentality

1881
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:21,040
really mean it looks mean something mean uv

1882
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:24,000
It is evident that Paaji has worked so hard on him

1883
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:27,199
Already when such a senior player

1884
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,520
If he gives close coaching then something changes

1885
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:31,280
Young people have a huge advantage because if they have so much

1886
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,040
Senior player who has played such big games

1887
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,600
Tournament Comments Up Uske Experience

1888
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,679
there is a meaning for every thing if that thing is saying something

1889
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,080
isn't it so after thinking about it because

1890
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,920
He has been in that situation many times

1891
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,360
You need one thing, not the exam

1892
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:48,960
I have brought the answer for it, you can see it

1893
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:51,360
It is very helpful, my question to you is this

1894
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:54,800
that you shared the dressing room with Jose Patla

1895
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:57,679
with yes wicketkeeper batsman right so

1896
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:00,480
What conversations took place there

1897
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,719
The conversations used to be that I would tell them this

1898
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,600
I used to ask you that you play with so many over periods

1899
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,679
and you are now a captain so what does that mean

1900
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,000
There has been a change over the period so he said friend

1901
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:12,880
Nothing, I just kept gaining experience

1902
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,480
And I learned faster from experience

1903
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,159
So if I am failing, why am I failing?

1904
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,600
So it's not that I mean that thing

1905
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:19,000
did you neglect it or not it's ok

1906
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,719
if you go with that thing

1907
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,880
learned and it feels great that if someone

1908
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:27,840
If the appreciation comes from such a big player then

1909
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,600
I was with them for 3 years and I have been playing for 3 years.

1910
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,480
So every year I meet her, she always

1911
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,080
tells me that you look

1912
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:35,920
Improvement always feels good to me

1913
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:38,640
It seems whenever he used to say yaar you are

1914
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,400
Improved is that thing that yes, somewhere

1915
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,840
no you are doing something good

1916
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:45,440
Whatever you are becoming, that is what is mine

1917
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:48,960
That is success for me, success is like for me

1918
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:51,360
Success is like being the best version of yourself

1919
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,360
Yourself and a place that you don't want to stay

1920
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,280
Friend, you are in one place, nothing came from there

1921
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:58,000
I just won't play like that, I don't know my

1922
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,679
You have to learn by going out of your comfort zone

1923
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,360
Kohli should have played with Rohit Sharma as well

1924
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:04,679
play with jos butler as well

1925
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:08,320
Play. What is the common thing?

1926
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:12,120
All the dedication because I feel that

1927
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:15,679
Those are such good contracts

1928
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:19,320
what is it that they have

1929
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:23,199
Keeps you motivated for now to play for

1930
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:24,960
Their respectable countries. So that every one

1931
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,560
I don't have it because there are a lot of players

1932
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,679
are they comfortable that they are a

1933
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:32,320
Running value. So it would have been a respectable thing

1934
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:36,640
Isn't it true that it is for our country

1935
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:38,159
above all money fame they are giving all in to her

1936
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,560
that respect that I feel for them

1937
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:42,560
Makes it different. Jos Buttler understands that his

1938
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,960
How big is your fan following in India?

1939
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,360
Yes yes I understand. He understands completely.

1940
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,719
Have you ever talked to him about India?

1941
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,440
about? Since the time I started playing cricket

1942
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:54,000
We haven't done it since he has been playing IPL

1943
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,560
So they understand that everything means AB

1944
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,040
de Villiers Jos Buttler Lasith Malinga These Few

1945
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:02,320
There are players who have a fan following in India

1946
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,480
We add a lot of foreign players in it

1947
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:07,360
Let's do it in some desi player's game

1948
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,520
It means a lot to you, a different perspective

1949
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:13,040
To be like to be care like

1950
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:15,920
It's okay to be careless sometimes, not that

1951
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,520
You don't have to do this, you have to do it sometime

1952
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,679
You won't think of things like this, nor do I want it

1953
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,840
She will drift away from you and someday

1954
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:24,000
should that's okay because there's a David As

1955
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,239
he was telling ash bhai that a

1956
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,320
The butterfly's quote is that if you

1957
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:30,320
If you try to catch her, she will not come, you are still

1958
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,239
If you stay, I would come and sit on your shoulder someday

1959
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,320
Is

1960
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:37,040
We mean we want to play cricket out of desperation

1961
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:38,639
without you you just enjoy the cricket

1962
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,960
the rest will take care of itself means your

1963
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:47,159
You will come whoever comes we are foreigners

1964
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:50,800
se bro who is your hetmyer you can

1965
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:51,960
Hitmyer End

1966
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,920
Obed

1967
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:58,719
Mokoy and Ferreira that's South African

1968
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:01,840
player like they were good flab yes enjoy

1969
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,760
I try to make sure every thing doesn't get out

1970
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,360
Meaning they enjoy learning the thing

1971
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,440
How much can he get off the field for this

1972
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:10,000
I am very chill, I don't think out, friend

1973
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,719
it's done i could have done better that's fine next

1974
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,639
Their approach does not change with the same approach

1975
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,400
We were getting out now what happens

1976
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:20,480
That now I don't do anything else, this is my game

1977
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:22,639
I will trust it, we have the same self belief

1978
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,639
Too much self-belief Self-belief maybe

1979
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,360
Because of confidence on a human level

1980
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:29,040
yes it comes 100 because there is a little bit of it in us

1981
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,800
Why don't I have self belief?

1982
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,600
I think the reason is because we are in India

1983
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,440
I am playing cricket. I'm scared sometimes

1984
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:39,600
From the public. also from the public

1985
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:42,000
No. going back where you came from

1986
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,360
If I get out, where will I go, people?

1987
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,159
Because looking at the public I believe that they

1988
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:51,280
They troll and memes are made. it's ok

1989
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:54,080
Friend, it means everyone has their opinion. it's ok and

1990
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,960
They are giving hard and money to watch you. Give

1991
01:23:54,080 --> 01:24:00,320
will also think that you will perform this

1992
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:03,280
That's normal, it's acceptable. But

1993
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:06,320
Don't let that thing go to your head. because he

1994
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:09,360
It is temporary. If You Are Not Doing Well There

1995
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:11,600
Will troll you. They will make meme out of you.

1996
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:16,239
but if you start performing they will like

1997
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:17,679
I will lift you up and keep you up. so that's the public's

1998
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:19,520
It's not the side that's trolling you.

1999
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,920
You also have that side that if you do well

2000
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,600
I will not fight with anyone else on your behalf

2001
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,880
They. How are you saying that he is doing this

2002
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:29,120
This is what he did. so it's what it means

2003
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,639
That is the reason why cricket is so popular.

2004
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,880
Are there cricket memes exchanged?

2005
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:35,920
Insta DM? yes yes we were very happy

2006
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:38,400
Are. I mean exactly, because now I

2007
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,480
It's probably been 7-8 months. I don't use

2008
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,760
I have a friend of mine and I gave it to him

2009
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,840
because I think that a little

2010
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,679
There is distraction because there is so much content

2011
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,040
Now you can see reels on Instagram

2012
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,679
If you keep watching, I feel a little

2013
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:51,520
that it is a waste of time but the reels

2014
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,760
which makes them their sense of humor

2015
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,600
I don't know where you get so much brain from

2016
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,239
We are guys so we enjoy a lot when

2017
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,080
You should also see hmm, you know? A new term has emerged

2018
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:02,800
It is in the world of Genghis. it is called

2019
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:06,480
Brain rot I think. Brain rot. Brain Rot

2020
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:08,159
Meaning, it will rot the mind. means backwards

2021
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,080
going. Yes. going in reverse.

2022
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:13,040
going in reverse. well maybe.

2023
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,800
And this is being fueled by short content

2024
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:17,679
Because of. that means if you sit down

2025
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,239
All day long with reels. So then your

2026
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,920
Dopamine systems go haywire. It is possible

2027
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:24,800
Is. so that's what I needed

2028
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,960
It is not so much that I get distracted

2029
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,719
That means no matter how strong you become

2030
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,040
If you see something that you

2031
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,120
It doesn't seem like she stays in my mind. This way

2032
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,639
No, yes, it stays in my mind, friend

2033
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,040
Why did he say that? That's not how I am

2034
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:38,880
Is. Why is this so? So there is no need to see

2035
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,480
No. Why? I mean I mean I'm taking

2036
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,719
Care of my body. I am taking care of

2037
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,159
My mind. I will not see it. we these

2038
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,080
It is very important for a cricketer. Very

2039
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:48,400
It is necessary. is a must. because we

2040
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:51,840
Actually cricket after one point you

2041
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,600
It is played through the mind. 100% no 100%

2042
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,400
They say it's a psychological battle

2043
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,760
Bowling vs Batting. Yes. because no one

2044
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:02,560
A match is going on, there is a bowler

2045
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:04,239
His so much hype, stats etc. this, that, at

2046
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,080
At the end of the day you have to see the ball. Your

2047
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:09,120
I don't need to look at the stats. If your

2048
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,800
Your skills and your mind are right on that day

2049
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,360
will be. Your planning will be correct. you will

2050
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,840
If the pebbles are his then they are simple one

2051
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:17,760
Do not bring extra unnecessary things that friend

2052
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,000
He does this, he bowls the ball like this,

2053
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,080
So it stays in your mind, he put it there

2054
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,520
No, this is already on your mind

2055
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:28,560
he does it, he does it, now look at the ball

2056
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:31,120
You have batted only against Adeep, yes

2057
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:35,159
What is that vibe of my first IPL?

2058
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:38,080
A six probably over covers on Adeep

2059
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:41,360
But what makes you think that they have so many

2060
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:44,960
Why have you got wickets at the international level

2061
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,960
one is very

2062
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:51,840
Discipline is very hard working and he is

2063
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:54,000
cold very cold means do you ever see

2064
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,080
He knows that there is no expression after taking a wicket

2065
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,480
It means the same self-belief of a cool mind

2066
01:26:56,080 --> 01:27:01,440
He is bowling with a cool head

2067
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:03,280
I think we are the same thing

2068
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:06,159
because everybody has the skill but this

2069
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:08,080
There is an extra value that you add, right?

2070
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:10,080
ho up your game the next time you think about it

2071
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:13,040
How can I make my team win the match

2072
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,040
I can say that Adeep that's why he is like

2073
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:17,520
That's why I'm asking you about them

2074
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,679
because i am his fan but also i

2075
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,040
I am asking you because you have discussed Bumrah's case

2076
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,639
Shared a dressing room with him. Trent

2077
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:27,760
Also shared dressing room with Bolt

2078
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:30,960
Is. These are two great bowlers. so friend if

2079
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:33,440
What do you need to become a great bowler?

2080
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:36,239
remains mentally what you have known because

2081
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:39,440
I also feel neither wicketkeepers nor bowlers

2082
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:41,199
Understand deeply. self believe that

2083
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:45,280
We need more than just batsmen

2084
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:48,080
Because they have such a small margin that it is half

2085
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:51,320
If a little bit here and there in volley and yorker

2086
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:54,159
dist vo hua length

2087
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:57,199
What happened was that ball was not hit by anyone at this level

2088
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:59,679
Chota Half Balli Will Smash You For Six

2089
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:01,760
So the same thing in that situation

2090
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,679
Thinking that if my yorker is not there then

2091
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:07,040
If it falls it will be a six and you will lose the match

2092
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:10,560
The same thing means controlling those nerves

2093
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,960
If such people are your teammates. Bumrah,

2094
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,719
Trent Boult to improve as a batsman

2095
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,400
Are you there? too much. too much of one

2096
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:19,040
There is a challenge, right? Now we don't even know

2097
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:22,239
that friend what is he thinking and we too

2098
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:25,360
I am also waiting for that person to miss you

2099
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:27,760
I hit. He is also waiting. So that one

2100
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:30,560
It's a thing like that. Now at that time who is so

2101
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:32,560
I am determined that no, friend, I will win. They

2102
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:36,159
He said, I will win. So it is the same thing.

2103
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:38,560
Controlling the same thing sets you apart

2104
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:42,480
From the crowd. We feel the same. Bumrah as a

2105
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,760
How is the captain? Mast absolutely mast means me

2106
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:47,280
ko friend i am also playing with rohit bhaiya

2107
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:49,199
Am. Rohit Bhaiya is the one who scolds

2108
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,199
Are. But when he goes out he says, "Brother,

2109
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:53,840
I play like this and I like it like that

2110
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:55,760
I want to play because I don't like any of you

2111
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:59,920
I want to bring out the best and I know how

2112
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:01,679
Have to take it out. And talk to them. Big Brother

2113
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,280
Seems like I mean I mean the Indian team

2114
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,800
I feel like talking to a senior

2115
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:07,760
No. It doesn't seem like you are a senior friend.

2116
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:10,400
are you talking to. They explain the meaning like this

2117
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,239
That we were also at this stage like you are. So

2118
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,960
When I was with Rohit Bhaiya, I had a lot of fun.

2119
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:16,880
Means when Rohit bhaiya said dressing room

2120
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,560
I was a bit scared when I was sharing it

2121
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,719
A little here and there, all the big players till today

2122
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,800
I didn't see it. So he said you came comfortably first

2123
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:26,239
Enjoy the day, you already know the atmosphere.

2124
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:28,320
You Just Go Out And Play Freely. that's me

2125
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:30,560
I will take care of the rest. That means, that's enough saying

2126
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:33,040
He gave it. That was enough for me.

2127
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,000
So, I enjoyed it a lot. We are big brothers

2128
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:39,360
yes it is going to be complete so you can play it little one yes

2129
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You play, I am here, do this we are a Kohli

2130
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:44,239
Bhai never scolds, he scolds someone

2131
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,520
no no share dressing room with him

2132
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:50,000
To do it was a dream come to a moment

2133
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,320
And but his vibe is totally Delhi boy

2134
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,880
totally carefree

2135
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:57,280
It is really big yes it is really fun

2136
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:00,560
Anybody has a great sense of humor

2137
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:03,600
we mean we have a lot of fun they mean us and

2138
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:05,199
Whose sense of humor is broken, one is Rohit

2139
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,480
Regarding brother, obviously you have read his press

2140
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:11,520
You must have heard about that conference also, Virat Bhai

2141
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,760
I mean these are the two that seem to be on top

2142
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,000
How is the presence of both of us

2143
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:19,120
There are such legends in the dressing room

2144
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,360
not with you, what if something happens to me

2145
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:23,199
Personally, I feel like this, friend

2146
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,760
I mean I go into flashbacks.

2147
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:28,000
I saw it like this

2148
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:31,600
by doing it really but after that it also feels like

2149
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,520
that friend brother it is very easy means like this

2150
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,000
I never thought that we would have thought that he would be like this

2151
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,920
It will be like this but you can approach it very easily

2152
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,400
you can talk to him, he will talk to you further

2153
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,880
If you do it then it will not be like that, there will be no line

2154
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,880
we are between seniors and juniors

2155
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,040
Do you feel it or not friend senior

2156
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:50,000
Junior means a complete team atmosphere and family

2157
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:53,199
Seniors live like juniors

2158
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:58,159
When do they scold me, I feel it only on the field

2159
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:59,920
is that in the moment we should do this, do this

2160
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:01,679
because it is necessary because we don't even

2161
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,199
I don't know what we're going to do

2162
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:06,400
From the angle of professionalism, yes

2163
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:08,400
Never in the way of professionalism which

2164
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:10,719
You don't mean to diminish you

2165
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:14,159
or something like that and chill together

2166
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:16,000
we do it, we chill a lot, yes we like

2167
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:17,199
Not in the hotel but in the dressing room

2168
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,560
It happens in the dressing room, right?

2169
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:20,159
Because after that everyone goes to their rooms.

2170
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,080
They leave because the match lasts for the entire day

2171
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:23,600
but whatever happens in the dressing room

2172
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,320
It happens, lunch happened, something happened friend field

2173
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:30,480
If any funny moment happens then it's fun

2174
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:33,199
Let's come and enjoy, okay just one last time

2175
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:35,360
The last section in the podcast is It's Ending

2176
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:37,760
Thoughts because IPL is very close now

2177
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:40,960
Is. yes I am thinking about it I am still thinking about it

2178
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,639
I'm not gonna lie but I'm thinking the same thing

2179
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,880
I am saying that friend, he has to win the championship

2180
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:47,440
how to win

2181
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:50,560
There is something we have to do to prepare differently

2182
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:52,800
you are doing something, just a little

2183
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,960
I am improving my self a little more

2184
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,199
Sometimes it happens that it shifts here and there

2185
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,440
that yes tell yourself this that this

2186
01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:01,199
These are small things. It seems like right now

2187
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,199
They will not be of any use. Sometimes it doesn't work

2188
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:05,760
Is. The only thing is that you have not prepared yourself

2189
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:08,560
I will leave it. No matter what happens. We do our hard work

2190
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,120
I will keep doing it and I have such a good team. And

2191
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:14,080
the biggest thing

2192
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:16,159
I mean I am so excited Rahul

2193
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:19,280
I want to play under sir because I am in under 19

2194
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:21,679
I played because money is ok but guidance

2195
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:25,360
Because of how much cricket he has played

2196
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:26,639
and everything means because I test

2197
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,480
I am also playing cricket. He tested

2198
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:33,520
The last series in cricket which was held in England

2199
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:38,159
3400 means IPL is also so good now

2200
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:40,480
If the Indian team won the World Cup then it meant that he was the coach

2201
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:42,800
If I get any guidance I will be very grateful

2202
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:46,080
I am excited for that, we talked for the last time

2203
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:49,360
When it happened he said that you are one of ours

2204
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:52,080
main player and we retain you because of your

2205
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:55,199
I really liked this dedication

2206
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:56,639
Friend Rahul sir is saying this we retain you

2207
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:59,199
because of dedication

2208
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:02,639
Your hard work and what you did in your last three

2209
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:04,239
He has grown his game over the year and he

2210
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:07,360
I liked that thing very much.

2211
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:10,159
I told you sir whatever you said I am ok

2212
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:13,040
to do it. I know you I am from Mumbai

2213
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:16,040
I am an Indians fan. but because of people like you

2214
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:19,360
So RRB has become the second team.

2215
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:23,040
So genuinely thank you. Thank you so much. End

2216
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:26,800
Thank you to papa as well. I feel that today

2217
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:29,280
If I genuinely want to know your story then further

2218
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:31,760
You went and did a lot for India.

2219
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:33,760
The whole country stopped and thanked your father

2220
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:35,920
Tell. yes tell this to didi also then she said

2221
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:38,080
no because didi wants me on Activa

2222
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,920
The poor girl used to take me along and I used to tell her

2223
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:42,719
that let me steer let me steer

2224
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,560
Poor girl leaves me and comes to the academy

2225
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:48,320
Right now you only have points of inspiration

2226
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:50,000
For. really a lot of inspiration means now we

2227
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:52,239
Both of them sit down sometimes, my sister

2228
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,800
I struggled so much that even my sister noticed it

2229
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:57,600
He also supported everything very much and

2230
01:33:54,800 --> 01:34:02,159
Big thing, I forgot to tell you that part.

2231
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:06,159
my diet is about me so my dada

2232
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:09,040
Everyone was a wrestler so there was so much expense in buying protein

2233
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:10,960
If he wasn't there then what would we have done if he was

2234
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:14,239
Wrestlers used to take the same diet

2235
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:17,360
Mummy, many times he even used his finger

2236
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:20,000
Pichal diya means one thing that is called silbatana

2237
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,679
whatever is of his stone is in it

2238
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,719
What are almonds in a shell

2239
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:27,840
break it into pieces and do that to cool it down

2240
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:31,000
She used to make me feed her 50-60 almonds every day

2241
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:34,400
I used to drink only cold drinks so that was my diet

2242
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,480
It means a lot, I think about it, a lot

2243
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:38,239
It feels good and I get emotional too, I am happy

2244
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:41,040
it would also mean that if he was not there then I

2245
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:43,760
It is not available here, it was very necessary Desi Veg

2246
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:45,040
Built his cricket career on the strength of diet

2247
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,880
Complete

2248
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,960
like you know that those relatives of yours too

2249
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,719
Are you watching this podcast? yes now

2250
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,880
I think if my father were here too

2251
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:55,800
Somebody else's child would have been playing in that place

2252
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:58,719
Perhaps we would have said it like this that our

2253
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:01,120
Because what dad was doing made no sense

2254
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,880
There is no use of doing this away from society

2255
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,560
Were living. So I think it is a bit

2256
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,280
Thinking happens. What do you know, I'm a little

2257
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,040
If I could reach this much then any other parent would think

2258
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:11,520
That I feed my son. What

2259
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,480
It must be risky. If it happens then glory

2260
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:16,480
Is. Otherwise it's okay. Otherwise, you are mentally

2261
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,880
You will become strong. Yes. I feel that this is a

2262
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,440
This could be the worst case scenario for sports

2263
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:23,040
But at least I have seen no parents in that

2264
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,480
if he goes then he does not think that mentally

2265
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,800
What difference does strong make to him?

2266
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:29,760
I may or may not be mentally stung. he has to

2267
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:31,440
It should remain well settled. if you are mentally

2268
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,040
You are strong if you are not making money,

2269
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:36,280
If your house is not running then what is the use of this

2270
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:40,080
In making you mentally strong?

2271
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:42,159
Or I hope that today many young cricketers

2272
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:45,040
got the inspiration.

2273
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:47,920
Genuinely brother, thank you. I feel like that

2274
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:51,120
I should also go and get the 21 strain for myself

2275
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:53,840
I feel like working hard on the band too

2276
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,679
Should I do it? Your discipline rubs off on all of us

2277
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,000
And always cheering for the group. thank you so

2278

Come out to bat. Thank you. Thank you. Hopefully

Soon soon. Thank you brother. So friends this was it

Today's episode. All our sports

2283

There are always a few episodes related to

2284
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:13,120
They are very psychological, a little nerdy

2285
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,920
There are. There is talk about health. so i

Did a podcast together. at this point the

2293
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,800
The cricket fan in me wants to give to the

2294
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,960
World of Cricket. A lot of young

2295
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:42,320
TRS would like to invite cricketers

2296
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:45,119
but it will also have depended on what

2297
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:47,600
The cricket fans want. tell whom else
