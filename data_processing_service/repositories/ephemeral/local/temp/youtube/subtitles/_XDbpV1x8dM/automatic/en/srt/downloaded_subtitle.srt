00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
Hello Friends.  Friends,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,240
what is the current situation regarding Iran Israel war?  Right now no

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,559
one is able to understand anything because on one

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,040
hand Donald Trump is claiming that a

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,360
complete ceasefire has been imposed.  On the other

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,200
hand, no confirmation is coming from Iran.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,199
No concrete confirmation is coming.   On

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,279
one hand, Iran was indicating

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
in the beginning that there was no ceasefire.  We are not going to bow down.

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,439
But on the other hand, some such

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,119
tweets have come through which this is being indicated.

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,279
Look, it is still not confirmed

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,320
but it is being indicated that Iran

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,320
probably also wants ceasefire.  But just

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
a while ago, just before I was recording the video, a

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,239

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,399
notification came that there had been a

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,879
missile attack on Israel again.  So can there be

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,960
some kind of ceasefire in all these situations

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,840
?  You can see this news, complete

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,480
and total cease fire.  Trump announces end of

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
Israel Iran conflict and at the same time

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,360
Trump also said that this entire 12 day

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,520
war would have continued for many years if

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,760
I had not stopped it.  So again here

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
Donald Trump is trying to show himself that

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,840
look I

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,280
am the champion of ceasefire and I get the ceasefire done here.

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
So, let us understand this in a little detail as to

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
what exactly

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
developments are taking place.  Who is saying what

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,320
?  We will know everything that has been said from Iran's side.

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Let's get started.  Look,

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,360
first of all you all know that for the last 12

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,680
days there was a continuous war going on between Iran and

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,720
Israel.  Here,

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
many dangerous missiles, hypersonic

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,640
missiles, different types of missiles

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,040
, drones were being fired by Iran

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,360
on Israel and Israel was also attacking in the same manner with great enthusiasm.

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
But the turning

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,840
point came when, as you all know,

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
America attacked the three

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,079
nuclear facilities of Iran, which you can see here,

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,159
through B2 bombers.

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,799
Specially for the

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,200
facility, because the

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
entire site has been built here, going very deep down, and

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
destroying it was not easy, but

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
America's claim is, you should understand carefully that there is

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,520
still no confirmation

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,680
whether the Fado nuclear site has actually been

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,719
damaged, because superficially it can be seen

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,520
that yes, the B2 bomb that was

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,600
thrown here, GBU 57, did penetrate,

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,680
but how exactly it would have

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,720
gone inside and how much damage would have been caused, will be

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,399
known later, so

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,560
what is the ultimate that this red line is crossed.

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,560
Iran said that because of the

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,640
way America bombed, we are

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,120
not going to stop here.  Punishment will be given for this.

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,239
And that is why if you see, late last

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
night suddenly the news came that Iran had

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640
attacked the US air bases.

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,520
Now the thing to understand is that if you

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,360
see, Iran does not have the

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
missile technology that

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,480
can drop it on American land.  So it is

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,560
obvious that he could have attacked the US assets across the

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
Middle East.

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
Now, if you look

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,040
at this map, all the dots that you can

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,440
see are the bases of the US

75
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,040
in the Middle East. And especially these red

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,879
dots that you can see,

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,920
you can call them permanent bases because the

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,840
US has been working here for the last 15 years.

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,000
In You In These

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Bases was being worked on.  So

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,879
what did Iran do suddenly? If you see

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,640
last night, they attacked Qatar.  A

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,200
barrage of missiles was launched.

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,040
What did the shower say that it is very

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
weak, I will tell you about that later.  But

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,599
again you can see that here in the Persian Gulf,

87
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,080
in Qatar, just near Doha,

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,959
there is an air base called Al

89
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
Udeid Air Base and it is being said

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,760
that the attack was carried out by Iran.  Now

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,560
what happened in the attack was that there were no casualties.

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,319
Because it is being said that Qatar was

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,000
already informed.

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,319
Because Iran says, look, we have

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,799
no enmity with Qatar.  But

96
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,799
we want to attack the US airbase inside Qatar.

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,200
So perhaps Iran had

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,440
already informed Qatar that we were

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
launching missiles.  Whatever things

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
you evacuate, it is obvious that if you

101
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,519
launch the missile after informing in advance then there are

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
less chances of any damage occurring.  So

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,120
if you see here, Iran says used the

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,840
same number of bombs as the US.  Meaning that as much as

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,319
America used bombs

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,040
inside Iran,

107
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,040
Iran too has used the same number of bombs on US assets.

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,120
So if you look here, as soon as

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,840
this news comes, if you look at all the airspaces last night of

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,319
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE,

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,400
you will see flights all around it.

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
But

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
here in the entire Middle East, no

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,680
flights were flying.  Because it is

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,519
obvious that there would have been danger and last night it was

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
not even understandable

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,880
how much it would escalate.  Will Iran

118
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,040
attack more bases here?  This did

119
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,720
not happen.  It turns out that Iran attacked only the

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,199
Qatari base, the Alaid Al Udeid

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
Air Base, and that is why,

122
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,680
if you see, Trump here

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,919
showed it as a victory in a way.  Trump

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,040
posted on social media here and said,

125
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,759
look, Iran had fired 14 missiles.

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,000
We intercepted and shot down 13 of them

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,040
and left the other one

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,800
because it was non-threatening to us.

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
We were not incurring any loss so

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
we left it.  He went and fell down.  So

131
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,919
I am please to repeat that no Americans

132
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,240
were harmed.  And he also said that

133
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,320
this attack by Iran was very weak.

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,039
And at the same time, Donald Trump was also

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,120
indicating that Iran's entire

136
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,680
objective has been destroyed because, look, if

137
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,759
America has attacked Iran, then there will be pressure

138
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,400
on the Iranian government and the Iranian establishment to

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,160
take revenge from America.

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,800
So Donald Trump was saying in a way

141
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,199
that look, now Iran has given a reply.  The

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
response may have been weak but the

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,960
satisfaction that Iran wanted to get was to show its people that

144
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,120
look, we have also attacked the

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,120
US base, and that has happened.  And

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,520
that is why if you see,

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,400
what is the last line that Donald Trump wrote here, perhaps

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,720
Iran can now proceed towards peace and harmony

149
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,120
in the region and I will enthusiastically

150
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,039
encourage Israel to do the same.  I would like

151
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,440
Israel to do that too.  Meaning, Donald Trump was, in a way,

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,600
calling for a ceasefire

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,639
through this particular post.

154
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,280
Now, in the next few moments, within a few hours,

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,360
another social media post from Donald Trump

156
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,440
comes and in it,

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
he announces about the ceasefire.

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,880
Donald Trump said congratulations

159
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,840
to everyone.  It has been fully agreed by

160
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,520
and between Israel and Iran that there will be

161
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,240
a complete and total ceasefire.  And here

162
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,680
basically Donald Trump said that

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Iran will stop its attack in the next 6 hours.

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,120
Israel will stop its attack in the next 12 hours

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,560
and ultimately there will be a

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,000
complete surrender within 24 hours.  Meaning,

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,400
this war of 12 days will be officially ended.

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,880
And see, Donald Trump is praising

169
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,240
both the countries in this particular post.

170
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840

171
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720
Congratulating both the countries.  He said,

172
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,440
I would like to congratulate both countries

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Israel and Iran on having the stamina,

174
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,120
courage and intelligence to end what should be called

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,199
the 12 Day War.  In fact, Donald

176
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,000
Trump said that this particular

177
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,720
war would have lasted for many years and would have

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,919
completely destroyed the Middle East.  So God

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,160
bless Iran, God bless Israel, God bless the

180
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,400
Middle East, God bless the United

181
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
States of America.  And

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,639
he ended his tweet regarding this.

183
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,800
Meaning, Donald Trump has in a way

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,360
announced a ceasefire that a

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
ceasefire has been imposed between Israel and Iran.

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
But at the same time

187
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,880
another post from Donald Trump came and it was very

188
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,599
interesting.  See, what happened was that

189
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,520

190
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,319
after America bombed Iran, some news started coming in the news

191
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,400
that Russia can supply nuclear weapons and

192
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
nuclear bombs to Iran.

193
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,479
And this thing actually,

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,039
if you see,

195
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,160
Medvedev was coming from the side of former President of Russia.

196
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,479
And Trump took a dig at this.  See

197
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,680
what Trump said?  Did I Hear Former

198
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,479
President Medvedev From Russia Casually

199
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,560
Throwing Around the End Word?  We were

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,919
talking about nuclear.  So he said, did he

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,400
really say that and is it just a

202
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,759
pigment of my imagination?  If he has

203
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,560
said this then let me know immediately.  The

204
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,120
N word should not be treated so casually.

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,199
I guess that's why Putin's the boss.  So in a

206
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,199
way they were saying that at least the former

207
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,759
President has said it.  But

208
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,360
who is the ultimate boss?  It belongs to Putin.  If someone uses the N word

209
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
let me know, I will

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,199
tell you.  And look here, what Donald Trump

211
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,319
said, that what we have is

212
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,720
20 years ahead of time.  And

213
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,720
if we attack with it, nothing will survive.

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,639
So in addition to our great

215
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,599
fighter pilots, thank you to the captain and

216
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,759
crew.  So here he was also

217
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,919
taking a dig at Donald Trump regarding nuclear weapons, saying do

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,800
n't tell us what nuclear weapons are?

219
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,479
Because we are the boss means we know

220
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,560
what kind of technology we have.

221
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,959
Well, the question here now is,

222
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,839

223
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,440
what did Iran have to say after Donald Trump claimed ceasefire?

224
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
If you look from Iran's side, their foreign

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,880
minister, Syed Abbas Araqchi,

226
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,839
said that Iran has repeatedly made it

227
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,839
clear that Israel has launched war against Iran.

228
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,640
We have not started a war here.

229
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,120
So first of all the one who should stop the

230
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,200
war here should be Israel because in

231
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,279
a way it was Israel who started this war.

232
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
So as of now there is no

233
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,720
agreement.  So, in a way, Trump's

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,240
claim regarding ceasefire was completely rejected by Iran's

235
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,399
Foreign Minister saying that there is

236
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,600
no

237
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,080
agreement on any ceasefire or cessation of

238
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399
military operations.  However he said that

239
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,560
if Israel stops things here then

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,920
we will think further whether to impose ceasefire or

241
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,839
not.  This was said by Syed Abbas Arachi

242
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,959
and just after that you

243
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,279
can see that this tweet came at 6:16.

244
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,279
Ok?  This morning then after half an hour,

245
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,519
what does one mean after 15-20 minutes,

246
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
another tweet comes in which perhaps it is

247
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
indicated that yes, Iran also

248
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
wants to ceasefire, and look, he said the

249
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,279
military operations of our powerful armed

250
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,680
forces to punish Israel should end now, which

251
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,480
means by 4:00 PM we have completed it, together with

252
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,560
all Iranians, I thank our brave

253
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,880
armed forces, meaning in a way he was being

254
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,720
thankful, was thanking his

255
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,040
armed forces, so somewhere a

256
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,120
person does that only when things are coming to an end.

257
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,720
So this indication was

258
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,399
coming here.  Look, even now Israel has

259
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,640
not announced this because

260
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,560
if you look just after that, even before that, the

261
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,200
supreme leader of Iran had

262
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,040
announced that we will

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
not surrender.  Iran's Supreme Leader

264
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,240
said those who know the Iranian people and

265
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,640
their history know that the Iranian nation is

266
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,399
not a nation that will surrender.  We

267
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,720
are not among those who surrender.  So that is why there

268
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,399
is an atmosphere of confusion as to whether Iran has

269
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
actually accepted the ceasefire or not.

270
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,760
Because let me tell you,

271
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,880
just a short while ago after the ceasefire was announced, the news

272
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
came that an Iranian missile that was inside Israel has

273
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,279
hit it.  If you look at this,

274
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,680
in Southern Israel, this is called the Gaza Strip,

275
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,040
and just on its eastern side, there is a

276
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,240
city, a place called Beshba, and it is being reported there that

277
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,880

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,480
at least three people have lost their lives due to a missile hitting a residential apartment.

279
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,600
Three Israelis were

280
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,279
killed.  So should ceasefire be

281
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,279
considered here?  It should not be believed because the missile

282
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,079
attack has started again.  Overall

283
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,240
look at the bigger picture here?  What was each one

284
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,560
's goal?  What was Iran's goal?   We had to

285
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,959
show Iran that we are not collapsing internally.

286
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,120
He wanted to show his strength

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,959
that

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,920
we will stand firmly against the hegemony that the western countries want

289
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,720
and

290
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,720
will survive here without any compromise.

291
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,640
Meaning, you can impose any sensation or do anything to us.

292
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,480
So, somewhere Iran was also trying to show that

293
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
and to a large extent, if you observe,

294
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
Iran has also shown that no matter how much you

295
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
attack, we are still

296
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,399
ready to attack you.  What was Israel's goal on the other side

297
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
?  Israel was repeatedly saying that we do

298
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,040
not want Iran to be

299
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,920
deprived of nuclear capability.  This means that even in the future

300
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,240
Iran will not be able to attack us.

301
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,000
Now has this goal been completely achieved?   There's

302
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,920
a big question over this.  Because

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,680
this was America's goal as well.  Trump's

304
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,920
goal again was that he wanted to show

305
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,920
that look, I am very powerful here.  When

306
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,000
I come to war things are over.

307
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,360
So, in a way, he also

308
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
wants to show that.  But the question is

309
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,519
whether the

310
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,519
nuclear capability that Iran actually had and the things it was doing have been

311
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,680
completely destroyed.  Look,

312
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,120
we cannot say this 100% right now because yesterday there were

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,440
reports that 400 kg of 60%

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,839
enriched uranium had already been

315
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,560
removed by Iran from the For Two site.  So if this

316
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,079
is the case then after some time there was a slight delay.

317
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,320
But after some time Iran will

318
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,160
regain that capability.  So it will be

319
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,480
interesting to see here whether

320
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,920
Israel and America have been able to achieve that goal

321
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
or not.  So let's see what happens.

322
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,519
But what do you think about the whole matter

323
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,040
?  Please let me know in the comments.

324
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,040
And before I go, I have a very interesting

325
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,920
question.  The question here is,

326
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,600

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,760

328
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
which countries are included in India's Strategic Energy Reserve Partnership Agreement?  Which of these

329
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,240
countries are part of India's SPR Partnership

330
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
Agreement?  You all know its right answer.  You

331
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,120
