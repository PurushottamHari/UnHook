Hello Friends.  Friends, what is the current situation regarding Iran Israel war?  Right now no one is able to understand anything because on one hand Donald Trump is claiming that a complete ceasefire has been imposed.  On the other hand, no confirmation is coming from Iran. No concrete confirmation is coming.   On one hand, Iran was indicating in the beginning that there was no ceasefire.  We are not going to bow down. But on the other hand, some such tweets have come through which this is being indicated. Look, it is still not confirmed but it is being indicated that Iran probably also wants ceasefire.  But just a while ago, just before I was recording the video, a notification came that there had been a missile attack on Israel again.  So can there be some kind of ceasefire in all these situations ?  You can see this news, complete and total cease fire.  Trump announces end of Israel Iran conflict and at the same time Trump also said that this entire 12 day war would have continued for many years if I had not stopped it.  So again here Donald Trump is trying to show himself that look I am the champion of ceasefire and I get the ceasefire done here. So, let us understand this in a little detail as to what exactly developments are taking place.  Who is saying what ?  We will know everything that has been said from Iran's side. Let's get started.  Look, first of all you all know that for the last 12 days there was a continuous war going on between Iran and Israel.  Here, many dangerous missiles, hypersonic missiles, different types of missiles , drones were being fired by Iran on Israel and Israel was also attacking in the same manner with great enthusiasm. But the turning point came when, as you all know, America attacked the three nuclear facilities of Iran, which you can see here, through B2 bombers. Specially for the facility, because the entire site has been built here, going very deep down, and destroying it was not easy, but America's claim is, you should understand carefully that there is still no confirmation whether the Fado nuclear site has actually been damaged, because superficially it can be seen that yes, the B2 bomb that was thrown here, GBU 57, did penetrate, but how exactly it would have gone inside and how much damage would have been caused, will be known later, so what is the ultimate that this red line is crossed. Iran said that because of the way America bombed, we are not going to stop here.  Punishment will be given for this. And that is why if you see, late last night suddenly the news came that Iran had attacked the US air bases. Now the thing to understand is that if you see, Iran does not have the missile technology that can drop it on American land.  So it is obvious that he could have attacked the US assets across the Middle East. Now, if you look at this map, all the dots that you can see are the bases of the US in the Middle East. And especially these red dots that you can see, you can call them permanent bases because the US has been working here for the last 15 years. In You In These Bases was being worked on.  So what did Iran do suddenly? If you see last night, they attacked Qatar.  A barrage of missiles was launched. What did the shower say that it is very weak, I will tell you about that later.  But again you can see that here in the Persian Gulf, in Qatar, just near Doha, there is an air base called Al Udeid Air Base and it is being said that the attack was carried out by Iran.  Now what happened in the attack was that there were no casualties. Because it is being said that Qatar was already informed. Because Iran says, look, we have no enmity with Qatar.  But we want to attack the US airbase inside Qatar. So perhaps Iran had already informed Qatar that we were launching missiles.  Whatever things you evacuate, it is obvious that if you launch the missile after informing in advance then there are less chances of any damage occurring.  So if you see here, Iran says used the same number of bombs as the US.  Meaning that as much as America used bombs inside Iran, Iran too has used the same number of bombs on US assets. So if you look here, as soon as this news comes, if you look at all the airspaces last night of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, you will see flights all around it. But here in the entire Middle East, no flights were flying.  Because it is obvious that there would have been danger and last night it was not even understandable how much it would escalate.  Will Iran attack more bases here?  This did not happen.  It turns out that Iran attacked only the Qatari base, the Alaid Al Udeid Air Base, and that is why, if you see, Trump here showed it as a victory in a way.  Trump posted on social media here and said, look, Iran had fired 14 missiles. We intercepted and shot down 13 of them and left the other one because it was non-threatening to us. We were not incurring any loss so we left it.  He went and fell down.  So I am please to repeat that no Americans were harmed.  And he also said that this attack by Iran was very weak. And at the same time, Donald Trump was also indicating that Iran's entire objective has been destroyed because, look, if America has attacked Iran, then there will be pressure on the Iranian government and the Iranian establishment to take revenge from America. So Donald Trump was saying in a way that look, now Iran has given a reply.  The response may have been weak but the satisfaction that Iran wanted to get was to show its people that look, we have also attacked the US base, and that has happened.  And that is why if you see, what is the last line that Donald Trump wrote here, perhaps Iran can now proceed towards peace and harmony in the region and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.  I would like Israel to do that too.  Meaning, Donald Trump was, in a way, calling for a ceasefire through this particular post. Now, in the next few moments, within a few hours, another social media post from Donald Trump comes and in it, he announces about the ceasefire. Donald Trump said congratulations to everyone.  It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and total ceasefire.  And here basically Donald Trump said that Iran will stop its attack in the next 6 hours. Israel will stop its attack in the next 12 hours and ultimately there will be a complete surrender within 24 hours.  Meaning, this war of 12 days will be officially ended. And see, Donald Trump is praising both the countries in this particular post. Congratulating both the countries.  He said, I would like to congratulate both countries Israel and Iran on having the stamina, courage and intelligence to end what should be called the 12 Day War.  In fact, Donald Trump said that this particular war would have lasted for many years and would have completely destroyed the Middle East.  So God bless Iran, God bless Israel, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America.  And he ended his tweet regarding this. Meaning, Donald Trump has in a way announced a ceasefire that a ceasefire has been imposed between Israel and Iran. But at the same time another post from Donald Trump came and it was very interesting.  See, what happened was that after America bombed Iran, some news started coming in the news that Russia can supply nuclear weapons and nuclear bombs to Iran. And this thing actually, if you see, Medvedev was coming from the side of former President of Russia. And Trump took a dig at this.  See what Trump said?  Did I Hear Former President Medvedev From Russia Casually Throwing Around the End Word?  We were talking about nuclear.  So he said, did he really say that and is it just a pigment of my imagination?  If he has said this then let me know immediately.  The N word should not be treated so casually. I guess that's why Putin's the boss.  So in a way they were saying that at least the former President has said it.  But who is the ultimate boss?  It belongs to Putin.  If someone uses the N word let me know, I will tell you.  And look here, what Donald Trump said, that what we have is 20 years ahead of time.  And if we attack with it, nothing will survive. So in addition to our great fighter pilots, thank you to the captain and crew.  So here he was also taking a dig at Donald Trump regarding nuclear weapons, saying do n't tell us what nuclear weapons are? Because we are the boss means we know what kind of technology we have. Well, the question here now is, what did Iran have to say after Donald Trump claimed ceasefire? If you look from Iran's side, their foreign minister, Syed Abbas Araqchi, said that Iran has repeatedly made it clear that Israel has launched war against Iran. We have not started a war here. So first of all the one who should stop the war here should be Israel because in a way it was Israel who started this war. So as of now there is no agreement.  So, in a way, Trump's claim regarding ceasefire was completely rejected by Iran's Foreign Minister saying that there is no agreement on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations.  However he said that if Israel stops things here then we will think further whether to impose ceasefire or not.  This was said by Syed Abbas Arachi and just after that you can see that this tweet came at 6:16. Ok?  This morning then after half an hour, what does one mean after 15-20 minutes, another tweet comes in which perhaps it is indicated that yes, Iran also wants to ceasefire, and look, he said the military operations of our powerful armed forces to punish Israel should end now, which means by 4:00 PM we have completed it, together with all Iranians, I thank our brave armed forces, meaning in a way he was being thankful, was thanking his armed forces, so somewhere a person does that only when things are coming to an end. So this indication was coming here.  Look, even now Israel has not announced this because if you look just after that, even before that, the supreme leader of Iran had announced that we will not surrender.  Iran's Supreme Leader said those who know the Iranian people and their history know that the Iranian nation is not a nation that will surrender.  We are not among those who surrender.  So that is why there is an atmosphere of confusion as to whether Iran has actually accepted the ceasefire or not. Because let me tell you, just a short while ago after the ceasefire was announced, the news came that an Iranian missile that was inside Israel has hit it.  If you look at this, in Southern Israel, this is called the Gaza Strip, and just on its eastern side, there is a city, a place called Beshba, and it is being reported there that at least three people have lost their lives due to a missile hitting a residential apartment. Three Israelis were killed.  So should ceasefire be considered here?  It should not be believed because the missile attack has started again.  Overall look at the bigger picture here?  What was each one 's goal?  What was Iran's goal?   We had to show Iran that we are not collapsing internally. He wanted to show his strength that we will stand firmly against the hegemony that the western countries want and will survive here without any compromise. Meaning, you can impose any sensation or do anything to us. So, somewhere Iran was also trying to show that and to a large extent, if you observe, Iran has also shown that no matter how much you attack, we are still ready to attack you.  What was Israel's goal on the other side ?  Israel was repeatedly saying that we do not want Iran to be deprived of nuclear capability.  This means that even in the future Iran will not be able to attack us. Now has this goal been completely achieved?   There's a big question over this.  Because this was America's goal as well.  Trump's goal again was that he wanted to show that look, I am very powerful here.  When I come to war things are over. So, in a way, he also wants to show that.  But the question is whether the nuclear capability that Iran actually had and the things it was doing have been completely destroyed.  Look, we cannot say this 100% right now because yesterday there were reports that 400 kg of 60% enriched uranium had already been removed by Iran from the For Two site.  So if this is the case then after some time there was a slight delay. But after some time Iran will regain that capability.  So it will be interesting to see here whether Israel and America have been able to achieve that goal or not.  So let's see what happens. But what do you think about the whole matter ?  Please let me know in the comments. And before I go, I have a very interesting question.  The question here is, which countries are included in India's Strategic Energy Reserve Partnership Agreement?  Which of these countries are part of India's SPR Partnership Agreement?  You all know its right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.  You can get its correct answer from Telegram.
