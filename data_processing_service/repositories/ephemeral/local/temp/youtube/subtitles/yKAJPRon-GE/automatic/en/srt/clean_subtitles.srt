Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, another major accident has happened in Mumbai local train. You all must be aware what is the condition of Mumbai local trains. Specially during peak hours. You must have seen many videos, many pictures. Many of you might have also experienced how a large number of people stand here on the platform.  Many a times it seems as if those people might fall and when the local train arrives here, people get down by pushing and people board it while pushing.  A very scary situation occurs.  There are many compulsions too.  People do not have alternative means.  One has to travel from one place to another cheaply. Unable to reach. So considering all this, accidents are often seen here and many deaths also occur every year.  What happened is that a major accident occurred early this morning in which many passengers lost their lives.  Let me tell you, this accident that has happened is very shocking.  Meaning you will all hear about how this accident happened and you will get to know what is the value of life here in our country. You will get to know a lot in this video.  Meaning, I will tell you in detail what exactly happened. Let's move on.  First let me give you an overview of this incident.  Basically this whole incident happened this morning during peak hours when people were going to office. And where did this happen?  Understand this location a little. You all must know that this is Mumbai here.  Here is Navi Mumbai and Thane district.  You all might know.  So here it is being told that in which direction was the train going from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus ?  He was going towards Kasara.  Basically, this is the sub-urban area, you can see it towards the top here. This is Kasara area.  So this train started from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Termina for Kasara.  And in the middle comes Thane here, as you can see.  And this curve which you are seeing, I will show you here in two stations, again in this picture, if you look carefully, this is Mumra Railway Station and if you look here, it is Diva Junction, then the accident took place here between these two stations. This area of ​​Thane district which I am showing you, here, between Mumra and Diva Junction, you will see this entire incident.  Well what happened, how exactly did this whole incident happen?  First of all it is obvious that you will see a lot of over crowd in the local train.  This means that during peak hours more people board the train than its capacity.  Double your imagination, just think about the condition of the train, I mean, it is a train which has 12 to 15 coaches. It has been designed in such a way that its maximum capacity is up to 2000.  But around 4000 people climb in number.  So you can well understand what the condition is and what the passengers ultimately have to do, they have to hang here, this kind of situation and there are even more horrific situations, you must have seen many times that people are holding the handle with one hand and going and this is the situation on both sides, people are like this on this side as well and you will see similar things at the gate on the other side as well, in this incident, actually because of this this entire accident happened, I will tell you how, actually if you see, here there is a train which I told you was going from Shivaji Maharaj Terminus towards Kasara and another train was going from here towards your Shivaji ah Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and in between both these trains meet.   That means, this curve which you are seeing between Diva and Mumra, it is being told here that this train was going from this side and the other train was going from that side.  Now the thing is that so many people were on both the trains.  They were hanging in a way due to which they collided with each other.  Yes.  Meaning, one train is coming from here, one train is going from here.  Both are so packed. Meaning, the train was hanging so much that the people there collided with each other.  It is not that there has been a train collision or any such incident.  Nothing like that.  It is just because of over crowdedness.  Meaning, there was so much crowd that people were hanging so much here as well as in the train that they both collided with each other.  Due to which many people suddenly fall on the track. Now, there can be many incidents in it. Someone got a head injury.  Someone might have come under the wheels of the train.  Meaning, many things happen in it. Well here let me tell you that normally if you observe the distance between two tracks is about 1 1/2 to 2 meters.  Which is enough. But what is the problem?  What I told you, many times because of this curve that you are seeing, the train gets tilted and because of the tilt, many times the chances of accidents are higher here. So this is being told as a major reason that most likely this incident happened at the curve and the passengers of both the trains collided with each other in a way due to which many passengers fell down here.  Initially it was reported that five people had died.  Many people say that more than six have died. Exactly it is not known yet. But at least five or six deaths are being reported here.  And apart from this, many people have been injured.  He has been critically injured. Many passengers were rushed on immediate basis to nearby hospitals, Thane Civil Hospital and some private clinics.  In view of this, what is the response from the authorities ?  Immediate response: The train services here were halted for some time.  And the RPF, Railway Protection Force, Government Railway Police, all of them started their rescue efforts. Emergency medical teams and ambulances were deployed.  Along with that whatever response came from the Railway Board, they have ordered immediate high level proof. You know this keeps happening in our country.  If there is any incident, issue an order of inquiry. Whether it has any result or not, no one knows. So here it is said that it will be investigated why exactly the accident happened?   There was too much over crowding and did the two other trains coming from the other side play any role in this?  The Railway Minister has said that the report here has been asked for within 48 hours. Well here you have to understand that this tragedy is not happening for the first time. If you look at Mumbai, many such incidents have happened.  Sometimes the bridge collapses due to overcrowding.  You might have heard it.  So what is the problem with Mumbai local train over crowding basically think about 7.5 million passengers travel on daily basis. Which is not a small number.  We are talking about 75 lakh people. And during peak hours the computers here are placed right on the door. And sit in the middle of the coach between the two coaches. They stand on the footboard where there is a place to climb. And over crowd has been normalized in a way. Many times I see people making reels etc. like idiots.  Meaning, they are hanging intentionally.  Even though there is no over crowd, still such accidents have happened many times. So, somewhere here people are saying that look, we do not have any alternative.  One has to go to other places for work and the best way to get there cheaply is by local train.  Then what is the problem here that you will see the open door design inside Mumbai right from the beginning.  What I mean to say is that mostly now your automatic door closing is being installed in the new trains that are being built. But actually the attempt was to not install doors in the local trains in Mumbai so that people could get off and board easily.  This was the attempt but it actually backfired.  As of today it is proving to be lethal. People are losing their lives.  And there is no real time crowd monitoring of any kind. Dispite you know it is the time of digitization.  Real time coach occupancy data is not available to know whether people should board or not. People are not told.  So many such situations arise.  You will see safety and infrastructure gap in huge numbers. Because there are no automatic doors, people hang out and climb up by holding on to it.  Apart from this, over crowding occurs due to increase in train frequency.  There is no platform barrier due to which people also fall on the tracks. Rake upgrades have not been done.   The safety system in the old Rex is not that good.  So it has not been changed quickly as of now. You will also see shortages of staff.  Well now the question is that in this incident which happened it is obvious that if there was an automatic door then this incident would not have happened.  It's a simple thing.  Those who cannot climb, cannot climb.  Those who are inside the train remain the same.  So here now finally the railways has reaffirmed that safety upgrade is ongoing and all the new electric multiple units which are EMU rakes will have automatic door closing. But at the same time, automatic doors will also be installed in the Rex that are already existing here.  You can see that this news has come just a while ago, Mumbai locals to get automatic doors, big decision from railway board, I do not understand why this fast track could not be done earlier, why is it done only after an incident, it is being said that crowd monitoring and digital information system will be enhanced and here a discussion is also going on that platform screen doors should also be installed here, especially at major junctions, in fact I will also tell you a little historical context, Mumbai urban trains know about their accidents many times.  In fact, if you see, according to the average data that we have, it is said that annually around 2000 deaths occur every year. And most deaths occur from falling.  It is done by electro electrification.  Meaning by touching electric wires etc.  This happens due to crossing the tracks. Efforts are ongoing here.  Like more trains are being added under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project. Rex is being modernized.  Signalling and safety are being improved.  But despite all these things, they are still not able to meet the way demand is increasing. And that is why you are seeing such accidents. But I hope that you have understood whatever details were there regarding this entire incident. And before I leave, I have a question for all of you.  The question is can you tell which of these railway zones is the largest in terms of route length? You all know its right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.  The correct answer is that you can get it from Telegram.
