00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,920
Mission.  Hello Friends.  Friends, another

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,160
major accident has happened in Mumbai local train.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
You all must be aware what is the condition of Mumbai local trains.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,640
Specially during peak hours.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
You must have seen many videos, many pictures.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Many of you might have

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,720
also experienced how a

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
large number of people stand here on the platform.  Many a

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,199
times it seems as if those

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,079
people might fall and when the local train

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,680
arrives here, people get down by pushing and

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,840
people board it while pushing.  A very

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,760
scary situation occurs.  There are many compulsions

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,320
too.  People do not have alternative

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,160
means.  One has to travel from one place to another cheaply.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,079
Unable to reach.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,079
So considering all this,

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,480
accidents are often seen here and

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,960
many deaths also occur every year.  What happened is that

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,960
a major accident occurred early this morning in which many

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,879
passengers lost their lives.  Let me tell you,

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
this accident that has happened is very

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,600
shocking.  Meaning you will all hear about

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,280
how this accident happened and you will get to know

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,199
what is the value of life here in our country.

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,720
You will

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,400
get to know a lot in this video.  Meaning, I will

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,000
tell you in detail what exactly happened.

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,159
Let's move on.  First let me give you an

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
overview of this incident.  Basically this whole incident happened this

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,960
morning during peak hours when people were going to office.

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,119

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,680
And where did this happen?  Understand this location a little.

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,000
You all must know that

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
this is Mumbai here.  Here is Navi Mumbai and

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,840
Thane district.  You all might know.  So

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
here it is being told that in which direction was the train going from Chhatrapati

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,200
Shivaji Maharaj Terminus

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,920
?  He was going

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,680
towards Kasara.  Basically, this is the sub-urban

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,079
area, you can see it towards the top here.

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
This is Kasara area.  So this train

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,479
started from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Termina for Kasara.  And in the middle comes

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,119
Thane here, as you can see.  And

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,040
this curve which you are seeing,

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
I will show you here in two stations,

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,840
again in this picture, if you look carefully,

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,479
this is Mumra Railway Station and

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,360
if you look here, it is Diva Junction, then the

52
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,360
accident took place here between these two stations.

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,040
This area of ​​Thane district

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000
which I am showing you, here,

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,239
between Mumra and Diva Junction,

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you will see this entire incident.  Well

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,560
what happened, how exactly did this whole incident

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,800
happen?  First of all it is obvious that

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,040

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
you will see a lot of over crowd in the local train.  This means that

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,920
during peak hours more people

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,040
board the train than its capacity.  Double your imagination, just think about the

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,440
condition of the train, I mean, it is

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,520
a train which has 12 to 15 coaches.

65
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,480
It has been designed in such a way that its maximum

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
capacity is up to 2000.  But

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,160
around 4000 people climb in number.  So you

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
can well understand what the condition is and

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,160
what the passengers ultimately have to do, they have to

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,319
hang here, this kind of

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,560
situation and there are even more horrific situations,

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,640
you must have seen many times that

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
people are holding the handle with one hand and going

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,400
and this is the situation on both sides,

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
people are like this on this side as well and

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
you will see similar things at the gate on the other side as well,

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,959
in this incident,

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,879
actually because of this this entire accident happened,

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
I will tell you how, actually if

80
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,040
you see, here there is a train which I

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,000
told you was going from Shivaji Maharaj Terminus

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,280
towards Kasara and another train was

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,440

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,760
going from here towards your Shivaji ah Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,480
and in between both these trains meet.   That

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,800
means, this curve which you are seeing between Diva and Mumra, it is being

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,280
told here

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,360
that this train was going from this side and the

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,599
other train was going from that side.  Now the thing is that

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,640
so many people were on both the trains.  They were

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,680
hanging in a way due to which

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,440
they collided with each other.  Yes.  Meaning, one

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,680
train is coming from here, one train is

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,799
going from here.  Both are so packed.

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,200
Meaning, the train was hanging so much that the people there

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,200
collided with each other.  It is not that there has been a

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
train collision or any

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,120
such incident.  Nothing like that.  It is

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,519
just because of over crowdedness.  Meaning, there was so

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,519
much crowd that people were hanging so much

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,440
here as well as in the train that they both

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,920
collided with each other.  Due to which

103
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,000
many people suddenly fall on the track.

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,080
Now, there can be many incidents in it.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,319
Someone got a head injury.  Someone

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,400
might have

107
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
come under the wheels of the train.  Meaning, many things happen in it.

108
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Well here let me

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
tell you that normally if you observe the

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,360
distance between two tracks is about 1 1/2

111
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,120
to 2 meters.  Which is enough.

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
But what is the problem?  What I

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,000
told you, many times because of this curve that you are seeing, the

114
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,400
train gets tilted

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,960
and because of the tilt, many times the

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,880
chances of accidents are higher here.

117
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,120
So this is being told as a major reason that

118
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,440
most likely

119
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
this incident happened at the curve and the

120
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,240
passengers of both the trains collided with each other in a way

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,240
due to which many passengers

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
fell down here.  Initially it was reported

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
that five people had died.  Many people

124
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,160
say that more than six have died.

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
Exactly it is not known yet.

126
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
But at least five or six deaths are being

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
reported here.  And apart from this, many

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,639
people have been injured.  He has been critically injured.

129
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,720
Many passengers were rushed on immediate basis to

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
nearby hospitals, Thane Civil

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
Hospital and some private clinics.  In

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
view of this,

133
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
what is the response from the authorities

134
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,720
?  Immediate response: The train

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,199
services here were halted

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,199
for some time.  And the RPF, Railway

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,039
Protection Force, Government Railway Police,

138
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
all of them started their rescue efforts.

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,360
Emergency medical teams and ambulances were

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
deployed.  Along with that

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
whatever response came from the Railway Board, they have

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,720
ordered immediate high level proof.

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,560
You know this keeps happening in our country.  If there is

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
any incident,

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,120
issue an order of inquiry.

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,039
Whether it has any result or not, no one knows.

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
So here it is said that it will be investigated

148
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,360
why exactly the accident happened?   There was too

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,520
much over crowding and did the

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,080
two other trains coming

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,160
from the other side play any role in this?  The Railway

152
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,240
Minister has said that the report here has been asked for within 48 hours.

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,039

154
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Well here you have to understand that this

155
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,919
tragedy is not happening for the first time.

156
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,479
If you look at Mumbai, many such

157
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,160
incidents have happened.  Sometimes the

158
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,240
bridge collapses due to overcrowding.  You might have

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,320
heard it.  So what is the problem with Mumbai local train over

160
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,080
crowding basically

161
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,680
think about 7.5 million passengers travel on daily basis.

162
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,199
Which is not a small

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,360
number.  We are talking about 75 lakh people.

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,759
And during peak hours the

165
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,319
computers here are placed right on the door.

166
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,919
And sit in the middle of the coach between the two coaches.

167
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,840

168
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
They stand on the footboard where there is a place to climb.

169
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,520
And over crowd has been normalized in a way.

170
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,840
Many times

171
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,759
I see people

172
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,520
making reels etc. like idiots.  Meaning, they are hanging

173
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,600
intentionally.  Even though there is no over crowd,

174
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,919
still such accidents have happened many times.

175
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
So, somewhere here people are

176
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,600
saying that look, we do

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,319
not have any alternative.  One has to go to other

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,319
places for work and the best way to get there cheaply is by

179
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,160
local train.  Then

180
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
what is the problem here that you will see the open door

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,080
design inside Mumbai right from the beginning.  What I mean to say is that

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,520
mostly now

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520

184
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,000
your automatic door closing is being installed in the new trains that are being built.

185
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,319
But actually the attempt was to

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,360

187
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,840
not install doors in the local trains in Mumbai so that people could get off

188
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,000
and board easily.  This was the attempt

189
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,919
but it actually backfired.  As of today

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
it is proving to be lethal.

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,840
People are losing their lives.  And there is no

192
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,520
real time crowd monitoring of any kind.

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,919
Dispite you know it is the

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,560
time of digitization.  Real time coach

195
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,319
occupancy data is not available to know whether

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
people should board or not.

197
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,919
People are not told.  So

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,759
many such situations arise.  You will see safety and

199
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,840
infrastructure gap in huge numbers.

200
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,120

201
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,880
Because there are no automatic doors, people hang out and

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,280
climb up by holding on to it.  Apart from this,

203
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,280
over crowding occurs due to increase in train frequency.  There is

204
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,440

205
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,440
no platform barrier due to which people also fall on the tracks.

206
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,759
Rake upgrades have not been done.   The

207
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,759
safety system in the old Rex is

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,520
not that good.  So it has not been changed quickly as of now.

209
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759

210
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,680
You will also see shortages of staff.  Well now the

211
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
question is that in this incident which happened it is obvious that

212
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
if there

213
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,919
was an automatic door then this incident would not have

214
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
happened.  It's a simple thing.  Those who cannot climb,

215
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,919
cannot climb.  Those who are inside the train

216
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,240
remain the same.  So here now finally the

217
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,639
railways has reaffirmed that safety

218
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,039
upgrade is ongoing and all the new

219
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
electric multiple units which are EMU rakes will have

220
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,599
automatic door closing.

221
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,240
But at the same time,

222
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,160

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,840
automatic doors will also be installed in the Rex that are already existing here.  You

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
can see that this news has come just a

225
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,319
while ago, Mumbai locals to get automatic

226
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400
doors, big decision from railway board,

227
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,000
I do not understand why this fast track could not be done earlier,

228
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,759

229
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,919
why is it done only after an incident, it is being said that crowd

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,919
monitoring and digital information system will be

231
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,519
enhanced and here a

232
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,080
discussion is also going on that

233
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,880
platform screen doors should also be

234
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,560
installed here, especially at major junctions, in

235
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,279
fact I will also tell you a little historical

236
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,519
context, Mumbai urban trains

237
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,160
know about their accidents

238
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,880
many times.  In fact, if you see,

239
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,160
according to the average data that we have, it is

240
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,880
said that annually around 2000 deaths occur every year.

241
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,760
And most

242
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,000
deaths occur from falling.  It is

243
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,480
done by electro electrification.  Meaning

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,560
by touching electric wires etc.  This

245
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,120
happens due to crossing the tracks.

246
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,040
Efforts are ongoing here.  Like

247
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,800
more trains are being added under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project.

248
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,399
Rex is

249
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,160
being modernized.  Signalling and safety are being

250
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,800
improved.  But

251
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,640
despite all these things,

252
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,240
they are still not able to meet the way demand is increasing.

253
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,000
And that is why

254
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,839
you are seeing such accidents.

255
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,720
But I hope that

256
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,640
you have understood whatever details were there regarding this entire incident.

257
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,399
And before I leave, I have

258
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,399
a question for all of you.  The question is

259
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,160
can you tell which of these

260
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,240
railway zones is the

261
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,839
largest in terms of route length?

262
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,519
You all know its right answer.  You

263
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,959

264
