This one child tried to change his identity He has tried to make us look at him, we are from Bihar Come from. We have a lot of talent, we have a chance Give it to me. And that is why when this Mahendra Singh touched Dhoni's feet after that game and He came and we asked him, "Brother, you he touched his feet what was that moment like and He is so cute friend. he says he says bro Now he is older than us, he has been watching us on TV since childhood I have seen you, when I came in front of you I had to touch your feet no it shows you the upbringing is well but is Bihar cricket is now united because of a child Bihar is going to organize T20 league. After Wow and give children a chance to come and see Play, bring yourself to the big stage could happen because of this one child where there were many flaws that needed to be improved Those who run cricket should go there I will not say anything dear friend, look a kid did this naam roshan what kind of system do you create friend How many children will we have in Bihar? so ya this knock this boy and i don't think he realises he is 14 he has no business realizing but he has done A lot. he did a lot for bihar cricket and Indian Cricket.

But bhai jitni hitting He has the ability, why not? give him a Go. We will of course have to approve your you know what else we also asked them Sidhu paaji and Bhajjupa were with me Harbhajan Singh and Bhajjupa actually I asked this question that this happened after IPL kya and his words were amazing yaar 14 one year old child says sir ever since we played I have understood this thing since I am in IPL that if you want to keep playing at this level then you have to Hard work will not make us work harder If it happens sir then we have to work hard now sir Understands Brother, I told you in the beginning that There must be characters.

We are all in teams Sometimes you used to play in streets and malls also. one that It used to happen. The one who gives the key the other team had this but what a Bowler man is also in this team and this is again One of two IPL stories Lucknow Super The Giants' go to spinner was Ravi Bishnoi India's prominent T20 spinner Indian Prominent go to wrist of T20 team Spinner Ravi Bishnoi has come into that team and Outshining shows how much effort you put in He was injured when he fell on the roof of his house I had set up a gym in the 2020 lockdown that friend if it is not working there then work hard here I will keep on doing this, I will keep on considering myself a model did sunil narayan pay and you are right i Agri must be a man with some stubbornness He told him to deduct his match fee, friend. I want money and the beauty of IPL That 3 months ago no one knew his name I did not even know now he is a star of Now you will probably never forget the Indian team No, you will not forget, I mean if they ever After this you did not even play a single IPL game Even after 10 years, you will remember that they One was cutting a slip and saying ok and something else You would like to know beyond the slips about these Is a very skillful bowler. I say this Was gonna celebrate her with her antiques Don't take his cricket away. His Cricket is also with him. Doz celebrations warrant themselves because they He is such a good bowler. such a skillful bowler Is. He deceives the batters. nice flats Also pays on tracks. So he has air There is speed too. He has variations too. So She's not the only Wonderlic Pony that she He has become famous only because of the celebrations. He has earned his name with his bowling.

Fire Sunil Narayan with fire. Ok. Moving on. Next a cute sweet moment. Or A I think this is almost everyone's favourite now Have become a player. favorite player for a Lots of Indian fans. like he bats Friend means some players and well whatever is good You always keep batting when you see him You think that you should see it some more. But there is something in it yes friend. just swing the bat and of course the Under the mentorship of the great Yuvraj Singh If they come then there is some flare of UVPA also comes. but i still think there will forever be only one yuvraj singh in the World. But he is very special. he is very Very special man. I hope we say in the The future that there will only be one anointment Sharma. One 100% One 100% Fingers crossed. Fingers crossed. A little more consistency Friend Abhishek Sharma, I saw a little more The way they play the game, they have so much in it The risk is that they expect consistency It is unfair to do this but we are fans, friend Do it when you get to see such good batting It seems that we may keep on seeing more but yes, So here I would like to manifest I'll make it two because their blood is orange Do you know about the fan base of RCB? Let's talk about the fan base of CS MI Fan Base We Should Talk About Orange Army or I think this is a very strong building up right now And this isn't the only fan base? of course Sunrisers Hyderabad's fan base is solid, It's Growing and We See That in the Numbers Everywhere as well. There is another team that The fan base is growing. Very passionate, very He is loud and increasingly very loyal Punjab. Hmm! Oh! or and his team has earned it Love. But Punjab fan has become comfortable suddenly In the base. Absolutely and it is a good thing You want IPL. Yes. I want someone who can be mine. So happy for Punjab. why do you think that it just picked up like this Does Punjab have a fan base? maybe i think Arshdeep Rab Simran who are local boys. that that That must be one reason but the performances Salutes the . duniya it's a winner S. Well. Right? Stories that win Writes in his own way. Mumbai Indians, The fan base of Chennai Super Kings is so Why are they big? because they won Has registered. There is one outlier in this, it is Royal Challengers Bangalore. it's not a trophy It has come for them but there are two factors there Are. One is that man factor. you a million something Just say it. I have lived in this country, in this world, I've been to many places but haven't seen such love Buddy. I of course did the great Sachin I had heard about Tendulkar and was very excited for him. It might be love, but I was not there then On the plains. Love for Virat Kohli is different it is in this country. brother o man they are just and Not just in this country. I told this story Actually, I mentioned it on my Instagram as well He was in New York and when we arrived If not on that ground then that stadium would still be built I was there three-four days before the match NYD of the New York Police Department an officer of the team was standing and our match there are many photographers Photographers are big media When they leave their houses they are police officers He asks him where is Virat Kohli and I I was standing there watching this Virat Kohli don't expect because when we go to New York When you went there the biggest thing was that People were entered, what is cricket? Nobody knows except the local people so draw them parallel to the baseball tell me tell me this then you suddenly and this and this It is not that the police is of Indian origin He was an officer. This white man was a police officer. He says where is Virat Kohli? where is Virat Kohli? So he says he will train Had been. says there is what my kids told Me War. they said get a picture with virat Kohli. Imagine. He is a global icon man. At a NYPD police officer's home When the police officer would have said that I will not His duty is on the ground. have some cricket He is living there. Cricket is happening now. Come and meet Virat Kohli. hmm imagine the Conversations in a New York Household. hmm That is what Virat Kohli is. he is Problem became the face of global cricket. one 100% that's exactly what I Said that if global cricket means the Olympics The committee said no they made him the poster boy when they announced that cricket is going to The Olympics. So that is RCB's fan base One of course because of Virat Kohli. But Outside of Virat Kohli also friend. Previous The year his team won the Women's Team he The roads are packed, friend. I said this before She has also said, brother I am a friend outside Chinswami The signal is of Caban Park metro station I've been standing outside there, and I've I have seen the team coming to practice for the match one day before two days before brother three-three 4- Four thousand people were watching the team's bus on that footpath The team bus is standing to watch and When the poor thing comes in the sun, he puts up curtains They give it to the players just to watch They are standing there cheering for them, there is no such love brother i saw it somewhere so that is rcb is an outlier in terms of a fan base and this It is not just in Bangalore, you can go anywhere late rcb fans everywhere hmm it's i think it's got to do with the band of cricket that they play they play a very Attractive brand of which is which is what attacking we were very batting heavy and That's why that was always a complaint of mine RCB is so batting heavy that bowling I never paid any attention to it and that is why I came think that was a big reason why those trophies I have been saying since the beginning that she has not come this season yes this is a bowling attack, we should take care of it ok this man a little bit about him I have to do it, even if we have already spoken I know about him as much as any nerd out there They are cricket fans, they are important I recognize it. they understand what shreyas Ayer is both as a better and as a potential Captain says that every format is different There will be captains. yes definitely my pick for odi at least why not why not So he has shown everything to himself In captaincy. what in white ball cricket Do you expect from a captain? As I have spoken to many of our cricketers See you when we do shows on Star. So I talk to him a lot off air and I keep talking to them about captaincy northern They always say no to Test cricket, it's a There is a different pace to the game in T20 It happens immediately brother if three runs are scored in one over hit fours hit four fours suddenly 16 The runs have come, you are under pressure, now the game is on The game was with us till four balls before the end was gone now thinking on your feet Shreyas Iyer has done that right by managing the team we are We were talking a while back about six years ago Take four teams to the playoffs It cannot be a fluke that we spent those four years I won the trophy one year. one year finals I took it. Delhi in the finals in 2020 I had taken it. This year it has taken me to the top two. So this year too there is a chance of reaching the finals. So that's why he is making a team as well. He is keeping his people comfortable nearby. And this is my personal experience Let me tell you. He is a solid guy. Solid Cow. You will get it once, won't you and he got this. this vibe about him that's you Might be seen in the videos and it's not known don't know fresh air. but he is a darling Buddy. Really a good song. you feel very brotherly, brother is coming, brother is there Mine is like that. i genuinely hope as mi Fan that mi won but as a pure Objective Cricket Fan I would love to see Shreyas Iyer Winning an Executive Trophy With another team story the whole country should recognize this is some special cricket mind you too Tell me, I get inspiration from them. I have a very big brother yes the best player of Indian cricket Hardik is one of the cutest guys Pandya is one of the most misunderstood guys One is Hardik Pandya and Before we talk about this comparison, I Let me tell you a story, I The first time I met him was a long time ago, then this I was an intern somewhere and not a presenter I was doing an internship in Mumbai Indians I was a camera intern, a production intern I used to do everything, set up the camera, do the sound I used to do everything, I met him there for the first time then when i started working for star I Met Him A Couple Of Times And And Bhai He is Hardik Pandya, how many times a day does he He would meet people on one of his warm Up Lapse in the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka itself came to say hi to ravi shastri with whom I was doing a show, I said hi to Ravi Shastri had no business, he said hi to him Who am I, my friend, could I have just stopped show me your hands with me you remember my name only I had no business remembering my name no, he is hardik pandya and he His mark is that he is such a person I will meet you once, after that when If you meet him again, he will remember your name. He remembers something you said last time And how many people does this guy meet? will be. that's why and I was actually in 204 In that first game where he was booked for the toss but and i actually put it up on Instagram Yes well that's enough now friend Bullying is happening. now you bully him had been. it was that game where sanjay Manjrekar had said behave at the toss. His bad for him to come back this season and do This with the team. Same thing is with this one too, right? 500 people are saying you are a cheater you did this you did that ok i will come I will show you the time and this fight has happened This is not the first time I have fought in my life This battle has been fought many times destiny's child hardik pandya or no Actually some things happened in his life Last year, we were outside the ground as well The document has been made face some very serious Financial Situation as Well and After After that winning T20 World Cup bouncing Back Mumbai Indians Captain So much has happened. I think in the coming 10 years people will You will actually recognize greatness. Give understand what he or 100% and and the The best part about him is that in life Whatever is going on in my life, I am so self-reliant I have never met such a confident guy. Brother talk to them anytime, yes i like it he genuinely believes that he can do this can do anything from anywhere And when that kind of faith is there within a person no end of course you could see that last season It seemed that there was a crack in that trust I came but he was so quick to wrap that up Go to the T20 World Cup, play like he did And I was actually there in Babidos when He was bowling the last ball and this was our end We were pouring it since we were standing on the ground and you could see him and you watch him on TV I was just tearing myself up but I was It's not that he didn't understand her What should I do? he circled around twice At his bowling mark. he was so scared He is not the kind of person who would burst out crying. he's just waiting for me to get this ball daalun because it was that big a moment for Snow. what he had suffered in the last three-four months I remained silent on this through those three-four months. To let his performance do the talking. When your life was going difficult. TRAI Remembering what Hardik Pandya's life is Was in 2024 o even before that dude. Even Before that in Baroda he himself said this Told that his father's fine flourishing It was business. Then suddenly everything stopped. There to live in a one BHK. ₹2 for ₹200 Hardik and Krunal went to Baroda for this Used to play matches. Money for food after the match If it was not there, we would ask the gardener to heat the water Do it. We used to make Maggi in it. And they used to eat more. And I I have said this so many times. Today You can see Philip Richards in your hand Is. That gene is visible today. today that range Rovers are visible. But then this fellow Worked hard when no one was watching. Currenty Max And now when Hardik Pandya bats or do you go bowling it's always with Lots of Ora or Taxes Over the Whole Ground correct correct I don't know that ora maybe from last has come from a whole year's adventure or what have I don't know but what is the story or else is the story Everything is created by your perception, your aura If the story is to be made then last season is something else There was a story, then there was something else this season's story there is something else, something else is moving on Oye yaar what have you shown me that's why we that white today As an edge as a tribute. Yeah. What to say you would want it because for ours generation this is like it it defines our entire Existence over the last 15 years. and you No what I mean I can say it now. I New of it a little bit already. that the Retirement Was Coming. So difficult to digest. because and this is something that i said when he retired Also. in the last 1015 years since Actually it has been 10 years since he started taking the test This guy took the captaincy of Test cricket Made it attractive again. me and you genji Let's talk about it. We talk about attention span We do. Average watch on both of us content Monitor the time. There is no attention Brother. And Test cricket needs attention I definitely need it. hmm such a long whole day If watching a test match is interesting If this does not happen, a new generation will not see the mistake He will get this much access to T20 cricket That one guy will only watch T20 cricket just him alone along side his team of Of course but he took the initiative that such cricket I will play so that you all can see it because the test Cricket was his priority and I I have seen it with my own eyes. we are from south africa I was in Centurion for practice Aya and all the players practice. And I saw him before the T20 game as well I have seen him practising. Even before the ODIs I have seen him practising. brother from test match First this guy polishes his white pads Is. That tissue is not available. Wet Tissue Shining the white pads with it. White His Thing is that all my whites are absolutely white Needed that is how much he loves to test Cricket. and which is why i think this Decisions like these are very difficult for fans to take. But How difficult it must have been for them. and I I had thought about it. It was not coming out from inside 100% we will end it but it is very difficult friend This is what kept Test cricket alive in the last 10 Over the years, I have only developed my attacking instinct The way he was on the field and the way he was that he had formed the team under his captaincy I am just on the strength of that or you know obviously Their techniques, their records are very Everyone will remember but what he has done From a mentality perspective as a whole For all the people born between generations I would say from 1990 to 2010. Correct. Perhaps 2015. Yes. Correct. All the inspiration is from them Let's take it. i actually feel bad for the Kids who won't be able to watch in playing. that's exactly what i said that Because a generation will come in the next 10-15 years I will say that even test runs are 10,000 It doesn't have it. The average is not even 50. So Brother he is a great player. 15 Players who have scored 10,000 Test runs in Test history. why talk about him yes? This is the case with I think average Any player who has played minimum 40 tests These are the good benchmarks. this is it 46 and 47 on that List. Which is why, yours, mine and all of ours Who has seen Virat Kohli work gotta remind them what he did Was. This marked the 10-year period where T20 Cricket was fierce and was at the peak of its Power. Therein lies the sexy aspect of Test cricket. Created it, made it attractive, kept it alive. whenever He and his team played Test cricket, you had no option to tune in because you New that he will do something special on the field. It kept Test cricket alive. Average of 50 Did not reach 10,000 Test runs. No problem It kept Test cricket alive for 10 years. Self How will you explain Virat Kohli to the kids? What is Virat Kohli? as i said one Of them will be kept Test cricket alive And to kept me alive I mean just Commitment and discipline is very easy my friend It happens. And we all what you said He has inspired so many people. Everybody gets inspired. Will do fitness, gym This and that will go on for another six months and it will go very well Is. This is a very good streak. so 6 months you You are going to the gym every day. you're eating clean It has started appearing in the sweet. then you slip one week's work is enough one week I ate extra and ate sweets in the evening Never mind, it's Saturday now from Monday I will definitely do it on Monday a voice came from inside hey friend leave it right, everybody hears the voice It comes inside you, it comes inside me she must be included in this also we give up he did not not for six months not for a year not for 2 years for over a decade he did not given up he still not given up that is Discipline that is Virat Virat Kohli human Just lying to yourself means the day your That day, you start lying to me The troubles begin. so you anything Keep telling me friend, what difference does it make to me I feel the voice inside me telling him that No, I have to go. keep saying anything from inside I am tired and have to go. Feels good to go Is. My legs are hurting and I have to go. in the head It hurts I have to go. I am hungry and have to go. I don't feel like going. I have to go to the gym. If It is part of my work. if I stay fit I have made a resume for myself I have to go. That is Kohli. that is how To Tell the Children About Ko. Exactly. you know when I make steamed vegetables and I'm eating steamed tofu around me people give me sad vibes what What kind of a life am I having? But somewhere I I know when I'm eating all this Virat Kohli's soul is happy somewhere Is. 100% or 100% and that's that's something What you said is a revolution. Actually he did it only in cricket No, for all of us. in fitness india fitness drive came in people that they will do this Yes, I will stop eating dirty food. She came because of them From. His treadmill videos and clean End jerk videos have influenced an entire generation Get two prints from Man Sins. or very curious to see what's coming How will generations remember them? I think it will be it will be down to a lot of us To tell those stories as well. They have their own The story had to be written, I have written it. Now a little I will write. Hmm. Now is our time Stories To tell. I know it's unfair to ask this. But his shadow can be seen in some young player Is. Mentality wise. Everyone is so different And now it's entirely different If you actually say generation then it is visible in all of you That fitness, that discipline of every kind discipline like all of them will now sleep on time there are belly any late nights they are all so fast they have worked on there Speed ​​because I work at the speed of said speed is a must. so you saw a lot of them Even Shubhaman Yashasvi is so athletic, so fit, so fast and an entire new generation that's Coming in, they are all the same. give and take All very athletic. Hmm. So, actually everything It is visible only in. has he changed cricket Forever? Certain aspects of it? Yes. Fitness 100%, speed 100% which way You should make demands on yourself as Cricketer 100%? And for which player? you can say that this guy has changed Cricket Forever? The great Sachin Tendulkar did. In every era They are coming, right? One is the great Sachin Tendulkar Come. Before him my father Sunil Gavaskar's Used to talk a lot. that in the West Indies Go and attack that era without a helmet That pitch where there was so much grass Where the ball used to go from here Malcolm Marshall was always ready to kill michael holding does who are express pace Bowlers scored centuries in West Indies Banana that time it was unheard of it was them i think it in each generation there comes on player and indian cricket has Been blessed by the great Sunil Gavaskar The great Kapil Dev The great I am MS Dhoni The The great Sachin Tendulkar The great Virat Kohli now rohit sharma with this vs 2 icc titles we are very I am blessed. lots in our sport Found heroes. There are many heroes in this cricket Have found it. Next up Sai Sudarshan. Let's Hope 1% go Sai or I love hyping of Sai Sudarshan. I love it as well man. he just he Got something about him. or when he runs If he makes it then he will make it in so much that it will bother him It will be the opposing team. what to do friend Stop this? He has that hunger. It is visible. Ok moving on. What? There is hunger in these, there is hunger in these. correct i i am very happy with the taste If captaincy ends this season then You should listen to him at the toss, post the game Listen, we all need to remember that this He is only 25 years old. so much maturity in this Even before the start of the season, he had contacted Jio gave an interview to the star itself and in that He said last season I Thinking a lot about captaincy Was. This season I thought nothing of it I will think about it. I will just react to the game going out there don't take a lot of pressure and you Can see that it has changed itself and 24-25 at the age of one year, that kind of Making changes is not easy. Hum And Still performing s about and what It is said that you should score 100% runs, isn't it? don't take the pressure of captaincy, it comes to an end Captaincy is like so many eye balls there is perfection pressure 100% that is says something about know in cricket circles People say that this is a robot, that means The extent to which their training has been completed That is what I am saying, all that means his Of course with his batting and all but that The entire new generation is like this but what is their specialty according to you your you are actually observing cricket De India very level headed and still very Hungry means it is quiet hunger right? Like of course Virat is the king and he has many Has been given the status of Prince for quite some time His hunger is very quiet, he is very hungry man brother this There are two types of people who like one He will say it is good if he gets the Test captaincy He has got the Test captaincy, ok ok Will get Test captaincy, will say all right Test captaincy has been given in five Test matches let's go one of those people we one of those People he I am sure he is looking forward to To this and fingers crossed it does wonders yaar In England. The new face of Indian Test cricket Era needs such a strong pillar In the middle, around whom the team is formed. Gill has all the makings of it. all the makings Of It Across All Formats. Meaning Test Specially in cricket. and i don't know there I have some gut feeling like this that he is very suited to that number four in Test. I think I think or I think and s I said he likes big moments Responsibilities: Virat Kohli at number four I have gone, he wants me to go now and I'll make a name for myself I think that happens moving on O man incredible yes he also did IPL Another hero actually friend and this one too said no The same problem was with them that many Sometimes it's more about your insides than the outside The voice becomes your enemy and they anywhere before this season that now I am not me no thinking i am not thinking of tearing it I will go and kill you, whatever happens will be seen. I called this face of his the mahabharat hair face Mahabharat is lovely I but I genuinely feel There is something spiritual about them, due to which Something has changed I think Sunil Shetty He came to our show on Jio Star for a few days first and we asked him this question also at the end said he just wants to let go let go a lot of times it happens like i said Nor does your inner voice become your shackles I should do it like this I should do it like this It is my responsibility, this is what I like and Despite all that, he scores 500 runs in almost every season We were making it but this season we unleashed it He gave his and other cricketer is appreciated by the nerds yes those who Everybody understands cricket appreciate correct correct we understand the Diamond we have in front of us and because How much role does this test play for the team He has also batted at number six in the team five times I have batted at the crease and also opened the innings. When I have also done wicket keeping when required. this season Also for Delhi Capitals. he said You can play on four, I will play. please open it I will do it. You just keep it up, I will do it. All He does everything. Ok moving on. what did he even say? What a guy he is! or or 2007 Remember the T20 World Cup when this number came to my mind It used to come at six. Or they would come at six. South Played a very good knock against Africa Was. Very good favorite of the match. yes and now They we have a Rohit Sharma stand or imagine what a story what a story and theirs too It's been a very crazy journey, like we remember The Recent Past T20 World Cup Captaincy etc but he was only in 2011 World Cup drop from the drop down a lot There have been downs in their early journey there are and means now this is a little more Refresher courses have to be given because every The year begins to see a new generation Cricket was tagged on him there are a lot of young kids listening to For them, they had a tag that these He is very talented. hmm make this many runs some played talented but that's it that was Rohit Sharma's definition and I think he said This is on Breakfast with Champions Earnley he said that friend I am tired friend don't say talented talented my friend that's it is that right and it took him so Many years to prove that he is far superior to that I am one of the sharpest brains in I am cricket, I am in white ball cricket As if you haven't seen the captain anywhere else Ofcourse batting is a blessing from the God friend what a better option is there on them but they need time It took me to break those perceptions, those beliefs In breaking, about myself. Indian Cricket Legend Mumbai Cricket Legend Mumbai Indians Cricket Legend. Mumbai Indian Cricket Legend. Very awesome and Such a lovely person, oh amazing person, friend. Amazing person. I said no, I told you at many places. I was an intern at Mumbai Indians I accidentally spilled coffee on him. Hot coffee and they are getting ready to go somewhere Were.

So that's how I put the mic on it There was a zoom mic that comes, I had kept it This is for backup audio with handheld phone I had kept it with me and there was a phone in it There were questions and a camera was set up And in a hurry, the coffee spilled on him There was someone with him in his team, he told me I scolded you a lot friend and I was 21 in 2017 or I am Rome I said career [ __ ] Rohit Sharma is finished before even starting Sharma pe coffee spil diya and he is like a Let it go, he's a child, don't ask him anything no the coffee has spilled what happened Ask your problem, ask your question. save my career That's it. Wow! have you ever met him and Told him. Quiet a few times. I I Just I Met Him After the T-20 World Cup After the Indian team was partying and they We were kind enough to let us in. so meet there There we were and I just couldn't mean them I got it and nothing came out except thank you. and I told him that because he People were very busy. after that i don't Think they check social media and all. I slept Told him that Rohit bhai you might know No, you have given me so much happiness. How many? Thank you very much to the people for that. hey friend come friend Between the media team and the Indian cricket team What do you talk about? Media Team As N Us Broadcasters yes yes it's pretty normal Yaar we meet we talk to them like anyone else If someone meets you, how do they ask you about your well being? everything is fine and you build a rap you Build a rappo cricket discus hoti nahi friend, I don't do that much friend, I don't do that much I do not do it because in that zone and specially When we meet, it is usually on the grounds When we meet there friend, he is in a zone Are you preparing for your game? Unless you are there We are interviewing them, so they must have come Will brief them that I will ask these four questions I am gonna is that okay do you want to ask Something else. But not her other dream Job. It is a dream job. 100% 100% 1% A Dream job dude. They can't have it any other way. Ok moving on. Ok Tiwari brother. So much has been said. In my eyes regarding this topic because we Saw the entire career of MS Dhoni. From 2004. That's correct. ah this is one of those Situations where I won't pass any comment Out of respect. Beans. and this to me had asked this just now in our Jio Star Those from our social media team come This has to be done. And I can't say that, friend. I can't say anything because it again this is something in which I have not said anything A day ago I had created a content that a whole This cannot be a legacy for generations. Of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Hmm. Dude, you and I have seen it since 2004 as you said. We have seen that phase when till MS Dhoni You used to feel this on the ground, right? I used to believe that whatever the situation may be, brother This will change the game. as long as Dhoni is there It's a match. Trust is his legacy. faith That's his legacy. This legacy may be a little It is brother Singh Dhoni's. and again it's one Those things we need to be reminded of To the people. on a more personal level the kind of happiness I felt it in 2007 and in 2011 Probably two of the happiest moments of yes 100% 100% means my complete human I did not feel so happy in the journey I mean I'm not married, I have kids no so maybe that will break it but up Till I Should Actually Get Married then get married go but because of those two moments ya ya no very happy or no and whatever about them branding image it's all going to be the Same I am always going to remember the Dhoni who one the world cup how yes one 100% but me I am saying this for a new generation now you Imagine, there are many children who were He is also eight years old since he was born. Now they have This is his first or second IPL. we are like that I am watching Dhoni and they will look at me People like you and me what's the hype about this guy man look at vaibhav suryavanshi isn't he better end or vaibhav suryavanshi is Promising But he is a magician, he has done magic in the field Pay Age Captain s Batter T20 World Cup 2016 Do you remember that game against Bangladesh? We ran in at the end and ran him out. Hmm it was his genius. Do you remember this? Everything yes. Ball of the Tournament. Yeah, from the outside Rohit Singh applied the spinner, the ball has changed. Both A spinner was hit from the end. Karan Sharma and Santner Both picked up wickets. and Mumbai Indians The trajectory also changed after this ball. Delhi's situation also changed. Right? Delhi Vent On to lose so many after this. I think Delhi won its next game and then Then she kept losing. I saw their name In MI's auction list. i was like this Is this great. very intelligent very Intelligent bowlers don't deny it after seeing them Vettori's memory of course correct same like correct way ok moving on Low risk cricket is the theme of the tournament tan bhai they have made it cool into there or they made it as their USP that you people are saying Maybe something is not right outside the top three You are saying that you will not cross the top three Go and show it and this has happened many times Teams but more of course not Gujarat Titans top three specially these two just bat Bat and Bat and Batman just don't stop. The opposing bowling team will get worried, friend. And what you said is take risk cricket with fours Runs are also scored. hit two sixes in the air I am getting extra runs. how will We look back at this season where the same team Two people are number one and number two is Orange Cap Table. Dominance man. Opening Pair Is Number One and number. or it's just sure Dominance. He is remembered for his dominance I will keep it. wouldn't mind seeing them open in all Three formats together. not open. Or I am not sure about the Indian T20 team There are many contenders there too. Butt or Butt test in ODI test why not test I am number four friend Gill I don't even think is leaving that spot now but I think they will be three formats Both teammates are three format players Are. Or will it be difficult in the Indian T20 team Perhaps. If I am being very honest. Just Because of the number quality friend. so many They are following behind. in the Indian T20 team It will be difficult. ODI in test match then ODI in test match test locked 100% teammates 100% ok end This could possibly be the opening pair in ODIs In the future why not ODI can be made is it or can it be made in ODI we give something special about them s up pairing Sometimes compliments are given in sports Another Very Well Dwayne Wade Lebron James and who else has been Rui Ronaldo so sai Sudarshan and Shubman Gill together with Sachin Wright also called tamil guys and punjabi Guys Get Along Is It Ya Stereo Alright ok understand each alright manifestation you Go all right ok Tanay bhai it's very round this is us a we now Predict by looking at the tree of plays we will decide who will win the IPL let's go ok round by round let's begin with qualifier one punjab vs rcb what a story man this season actually when all four Even if it qualifies, then Punjab and Punjab Yet you may be writing a qualifier One man for RCB to come here because GT Lost that game key game against Chennai Super Kings Wow Prediction Punjab RCB Qualifier One I think it's very difficult in mullapur Is. Punjab is not doing well in Mullapur Pie is this season's qualifier one in Mullapur Against RCB I am back RCB really or Mullapur because It's Mullapur but Punjab is also amazing friend it's so difficult to pick up if a pick If you want to do it then the momentum is with Punjab A little bit of I know or but RCB also has it We have the momentum, we defeated Lucknow Super Giants In the last game Punjab has Priyansh Arya Priyansh There is power and glory. Below is Arshdeep. You Wood hope Chahal comes back. a little bit He had a finger injury. Shashank Singh Shashank This is a meme of Singh. Shashank Singh himself is there, friend. Shashank Singh himself is doing wonders. Or I still from RCB in Mullapur. something about that ground punjab very She is not doing well there. do you think Will RCBS experience be like past Punjab? I think we thought that against Mumbai also. And the Mumbai experience was wiped out It was Punjab. So I think the experience is out Off the window. I think just RCB in guys Conditions might be a better suited team. so all in all its unpredictable but you you you you you you You RCB. very unpredictable but RCB. or ok ah ok that takes us to the Eliminator. or rcb goes straight into the Final Eliminator GT Mi Because GT has suffered two major setbacks As do Buttler and Rabada. not both Will be. am i not missing a lot and they are Hurting and they know how to play big games. They just have that big big game muscle memory. MI will be. Same MI without it out. MI its an eliminator definitely MI because I A role of genuinely felt experience It happens. Or correct in correct offs. every It happens in sports, it happens 100%. Muscle There is memory in it, so many other things It just exists as a team but that team Look at me Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, Surya Kumar Yadav, Jaspreet Bumrah there are so many of them. Like If there is any young player in the ground, he If he looks anywhere, he will see a man like this whoever knows will go then now when he If he sees that this is work then I will too I just keep working. no such problem Hui. That's up, yah. Hmm or for me it's like a 90% am I win but you never know And of course you never know whether Shubman Gill is A point to prove as a captain you never know but ya you back just on pure logic you back MI then that leaves us with a Punjab vs MI Qualifier Two. Or again what you said about the big game It will have MI in it. but i don't know why It feels like Punjab this season. who to Me it feels like Punjab. punjab over m I? I think if I'm beating you GT Carrying some more momentum in. Yaar de were carrying momentum into the game Against Punjab is well. The One Before the League Stage ended. Seven out of eight were victorious. So There was momentum there too. hey it's just end Because qualifier two is in Ahmedabad. A Truer batting surface, shorter straight boundaries Is. will it suit priyansh or it's just a feel Punjab or Punjab to go through RCB. So It's a repeat of Qualifier One in the Final. ok and then punjab rcb final Tanay First Time Winner Ya Ya She wow for OG fan for the ya mean that remember There's that yellow and red jersey and the white and red jersey posture arsenal style jersey correct it's either correct or they have the same Sponsors where I thought Irit was the same One of these teams will win after 18 years Just because of the kind of year Virat Kohli This is the 18th season, there have been many such occasions when that person has done everything and that The trophy went away passing by the trophy just for that man rcb two just you know i feel like it's like i would Love for Punjab to win what a team what a Tournament what a story but 18 years old I went and saw that man breaking very hard He has passed by the trophy many times K went and did everything in 2016, scored 900 runs I made it but still couldn't win, just for that It feels like the year of Virat Kohli let's hope let's hope or you know people say that if Preity Zinta happy to every indian man that is also true correct every pretty fan but if virat kohli happy than also all of india so its a v preity zinta vs virat Kohli final or but Kohli or I think so Write and I think RCB fan base deserves it It's done, yes it's been a while The poor ones have heard many taunts that everything Where is the trophy? There will be a trophy to show All in all it will be good for your play off prediction hai isara cup na or ok or And for a champion like Virat Kohli, this cannot be his legacy that he doesn't have a trophy in IPL give it to her do you you you you you you you think If he wins heel retires from don't say so Yaar I don't think he has years in IPL he will play for few years but there is nothing Left to win after that for Rohit Sharma too also there is nothing left to win or Actually right for Rohit Sharma then there Is ODI World Cup DI World Cup to Win There be nothing for Virat, we mean Virat will complete the trophy cabinet fully or only He has a, he has two champions trophies. only He has one T20 World Cup, he has one 50 overs World Cup, he has the taste mess. Then the world Test championship would not have been number one Of the test team. and now if he has an IPL Trophy that's it. Wow! so just for That dream RCB. or ok? Same pages. Is No? Ok. Ready Tany bhai. or is it ours Meme section. Ok. Up next. Ok. CSK This has not been discussed in this podcast. It has not happened that much. Yes sir. ah this was the season Not even that much to talk about. So what Do you feel it after seeing this? I Kind of Feel Bad for the fan base. I do as well. there some Of the most passionate fan bases man. look at That, man, is a legacy Theirs, and these make a lot of noise too, man. Look at this, this is a legacy. that's what i said to you that he believed that there could be a reversal from anywhere This man will give it. Hmm. And now that he's not there getting It is very sad, it is very difficult Accept this thing. we we that supasi To see that dominance slip away from your hands It is not easy to see something go away. hmm hmm But you hope they come back, I have scored a good score Hmm for the next season if Dhoni retires who will be the next wicketkeeper Urvil Patel is a very good wicket keeper batsman are in his team and have made him play ok so this means that confidence He has inspired me in the nets the manner in which the keeping is done I have batted so you know I am Abhishek Nair was asked on this show that if you had a bad auction then in the next two-three years you Can you recover? Will you recover next year? You can cover it. he said yes it is It's Possible to Go and Get the Pieces That You Are Missing. is that true? After the mega auction I mean and of course Abhishek Nair would know Better because it works with these systems. But after the mega auction it will be a bit difficult This happens because next year, the same number of Releases are not made by every team. Specially If you make it Indian then it will be Indian core only. And No team releases the Indian core To our good Indian players. One thing that has happened well for CSK this This is the season when the players like Urvil Patel Replacements have arrived Devolt Brevis they are here to stay good If you have done perfection then they are that big Hedex will not be in that mega auction go and because i think there are a lot of Chennai Super Kings releases are coming or things will happen at the end of this season If it happens then the purse will be much bigger than that mini one When you go to the auction, they will go for some players that they want who will come next Cameron Green will come in the year's mini auction of Australia Harry Brooke has been banned so he is It is not coming right now because it is pull only late and you don't do that because it's unfair On the teams, friend, they do all the planning We will take you, if you don't give your name or Harry Books Not Coming But Camon Green Is One player who can be watched for his end Overseas all-rounder but Cameron Green is a bit He is injury prone, let's see it surprise us 100% ok moving on o one Is venue change a hypothetical scenario? Now Narendra Modi Stadium will come in it It will become Ahmedabad. but wow rcb MIF FINAL WOULD BE SOMETHING. so many story lines how many friends actually and that we were talking about a while ago Big match experience on one hand is his DNA The DNA of winning is there to stay on that side of the line DNA of. Big Match DNA Butt on One Side Negative DNA of losing every time. Idar One vince and the other one just says ya big time Done. Now we have to win by losing again and again. it's Gonna be a crazy story. e year's own name why not why not its but its Going be appeal task now play from top I haven't thought about what I'll do now will not be the topic now what happened now that The preparation is done and now the preparation is done and now Now it's fun, I'm going to come back Delhi Are you finally ready to feel alright? to see and feel was in this chair yes yes lovely writer felt love lee man yes what will paaji say dude he was so intense man i feel something If I get it done, I know it hasn't happened yet not g or not yet and it will happen in two years But I have to do that now or I should prepare now Now it is done, now the preparation is done, now feel it Now go and feel what you feel have to get it done but do you think this is true do you think that Mumbai Indians reach the playoffs can they carry it into brother because I I told you that he is so used to such places It's such an amazing comeback DNA to come out In that team, he can be used in any situation I believe that we will win I think that is variant and that they have in abundance plus you know i don't know how many people are speaking about sky having his greatest mumbai greatest for any better Never scored more runs than this in any season In which Mumbai Indians batsman gave The great Sachin Tendulkar made it in one season After that now Surya Kumar Yadav is my enemy Quietly Just Going About His Work suddenly are the best season just like that So, as far as you have understood about plays, we What matters most in the play of stage First qualify for the top two that is Very to get one more chance like I did Said this format of play-offs has been started since 2011 Only one has started in these 14 years This time the team that placed third or fourth won the match. If you qualify then that tells you the Advantage of Finishing One Two Second Winning Those Moments in the game like when mumbai indians that game The team came out victorious against Delhi Capitals We are 132 for five at the end of 18 overs. In the next two overs he conceded 48 runs Make it. They went to 180. they seize the momentum in these two overs and then there was no coming back Gave it to Delhi. put delhi under so much Pressure in 12 balls. for the first 18 overs Delhi are in the game. They are ahead. so you Have to win those moments. you can't lie Go of a single moment. That matters most of the plays. Every Game in does it matter and in plays because The context is so much and the stakes are so much Is. Does it matter? but do you think 18 years in to ipl we figure more patterns about Players that have a more experience. did you learn? or or correct. The more you learn, the more you Play, the more you realize how to do it Is. Look at that frame, man. Too much ora. Hey Fear. Meaning if I am in the occasion it explodes like this Seeing this. Look at that Ora factory. The World's greatest all format bowler right Now. One of the Worlds Premiere Allrounders a murderer of all sorts of Bowling Surya Kumar Yadav and the Greatest One of the greatest IPL captains, White Ball Captain Rohit Sharma. behind him a Future Superstar in Tilak Varma. Brother friend Chaos. And look at that. If the core is like this. As such ho bhaiya this is this is all handpicked and Built it's not like other teams broke it Is. In football we hear that somewhere you You break this broken guy, this broken guy Not there. you can technically say hardik Pandya came back from Gujarat but made a comeback It was not Mumbai. we already told you playo Stop it before it happens. Otherwise, you can go straight to the trophy We will talk. True. It's so well on this. same i when We are ready to take revenge on the revenge, I think her Cricket fan knew this was at least a play off Team top four so guaranteed or correct so much Strong Indian core dude its insane now Now it's a matter of OG mentality or killer Killer Instinct Mar Do Guys Dominate Butt This time it's going to be a little bit difficult moving on Look, this is an MI [Laughter] have seen it I have. Why don't you shut up, wherever I am taking you hmm let's go. Brother, this is not happening to this team just like that. Or Done? We are I, so am I. am i haz Winning the championship? no not this season Buddy. This season I mean they can if there is one The team that can win from fourth it is them. But it's going to be an appealing task. and you would Want a new team to do it. Hmm hmm hmm. This is an objective fan open. My This is an opinion. Of course, of course. i want To C Championship Number Six. Yeah, the Sixth star on the batch. Yes. Ok. Ok. loyal rohit fan also mean c may be just Maybe BB. Let them have this one. Yeah? Yeah. I am sure. I am sure. Tell me brother. Dude, as a neutral. You know no. Actually as a Kohli fan for Kohli. wouldn't mind seeing it. I don't Think anyone's mind. Right? Anyone Wood Mind? Anybody like even the most hard core CSK MI fans wood se yaar. I don't know What CSK fans? I think they will be well Buddy. don't give them, you should give them that much Credit. I think they are the very knowledgeable Fans don't understand cricket well. before Before Kohli leads the game. or an IPL There should be a trophy, friend. scored so many runs In IPL. He has given so much happiness. One He should get his happiness back. Ok. Mark my words if RCB come to the final will be the stadium boys nothing will give me more pleasure than two Lift the trophy with beer I mean tried for many many years I missed him a lot you know the emotional one of your teammates here he just quietly did a Fis form like that that is the RCB emotion That's what these guys and of course AP De Villiers is an amazing star of RCB But this passion is there in very few teams Is. A team that has achieved so many results What did you do, you didn't even give me a single trophy Is. But that love has not diminished. sometimes he The confidence has not diminished. ever look at him Going like this time. look at that look at That's what they did. or honestly it will Be a good visual to see Kohli along side AB de Villiers along side Chris Gayle. All three are losing the same trophy. What They are superstars, man. what a batting line up Was. I think Chris Gayle and AB W Made RCB cool along 100% that's why I I am saying that I built a fan base from there He always played brand cricket let's see what happens let's see what Happens oh what's the matter mahakum has reached Virat Kohli's jersey is definitely RCB Are you winning now or what's the matter oh well it's reaching places kya baat hai Siddhivinayak I Actually Had Actually Scene RCB Jersey There A Lot Places Around the world yah south i saw him south Africa or I Have Seen It in the USS Yvonne Leg has also uploaded a post Crazy or they have a world wide fan following Massive fan following or right or massive fan follower that and i love him of course who doesnt will be fun to watch va fun to watch And it will be an iconic season for them wow wow well along side virat bhuvneshwar Kumar KP Yash Dayal All These Hazelwood Rajat Patidar Rajat Patidar Man What The story will be for him to lead RCB Trophy in first season, 18 year drought ends karna kamaj because we always talk about Championship winning squads still no Thirumal Set Tea Suman Ki Baat Suman Yes Tea Suman is good, all the best to RCB Fan.
