Take one name from 2025 IPL season.

Any one name. The Name That Stuck Out To You.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,760
Dude, it would be unfair to take one. this has been the

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,040
IPL of young uncapped Indians who

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Get up and raise your hand to the whole world

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,200
I have told the cricketers from all over the world

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,040
that it's your turn to pull up your socks

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,080
Because we have come prepared, Vaibhav

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,439
Suryavanshi look at Priyansh Arya wow man

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,240
Just wow Ayush matre Urvil Patel name hai

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,920
You are my friend Sai Sudarshan Sai Sudarshan but Sai

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,520
Sudarshan is this bean established friend

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
India has played but I am saying just

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,799
look at the guys vaibhav suryavanshi what is the story

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,119
yes my brother. What's the story? Yes. I Guess

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
Vaibhav Suryavanshi is at one name na. thats

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,280
Stuck out. don't leave priyansh behind

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
Buddy. He has played such a mature innings.

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,960
Against Mumbai Indians it's very

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,040
Difficult. I agree. At least five or six like this

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,600
Guaranteed to play for India cricketers

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
He was seen in this IPL. 100% white brother

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
There is going to be a queue for the white ball.

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
India can make three or four white teams

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
In the ball. Now three or four teams can be formed.

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,759
And all of them will be the world's best. I

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,439
Guess it's time for T10 cricket now just

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,160
fourth team yes something has to be done correct ok

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,360
Among the bowlers, the bowlers that stuck out this

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,680
Year Digvish Rathi with solid character

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
I mean the guy did so many celebrations that

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
The match referee banned him but he again

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
also not stopped and you need characters

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,400
Like that in spot who is the hero of this IPL

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,800
if they go want to do what a lot of

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,319
Punjab fans want them to do what it has to be

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Shreyas Iyer and I am not saying this just

55
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,000
Based on this season, last season KKR

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,120
I won the trophy brother I am not even saying this

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,080
Based on the last season. 2019 to 2025 six

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,480
There has been no captain who has been in years

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,280
Been as successful as Shreyas Iyer. let that happen

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,319
Sync in. Delhi qualified in 19-20

61
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Got it done. Made Delhi play the final in 20.

62
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,560
Got KKR qualified last year.

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,239
Made KKR win the trophy. once this season

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,720
Then I got myself qualified. in the top two

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,959
Got him qualified. I don't think captain

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,440
There is so much talk about Shreyas Iyer and it should happen

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,560
Want the most in IPL in the last six years

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,879
Successful Captain Four

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,720
Qualifications One final played One final played

70
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,040
If K wins then two of those four will play the final

71
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,239
Gaya took it to the top two this season

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,159
Not IPL captaincy but India captaincy

73
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,360
There should be a mention of his success in the scheme as well

74
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,360
Here is the rate, friend, hmm, how many such IPL captains

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,720
We have seen that in IPL

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,920
We make you win the trophy, India Captain

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,760
I don't know why Shreyas Iyer

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
There isn't such thing around. he worked on

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,080
Shot cummings as a better as well. Short Ball

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,920
He used to get stuck against. Now I don't get stuck.

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
He has worked it. he went back to the

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,040
Domestic cricket and he worked on it

83
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,200
There were flaws in his game. give him credit

84
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,200
For that. Here are some top moments from

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,840
This year IPL started

86
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:54,720
Vin Coley's Manipulley. Vaibhav Suryavanshi.

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Thoughts on this sweet face but such mentality.

88
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,080
Friend, I will tell you. I did this just like this

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,200
After the knock I made a reel on it

90
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
And their coach is our Bhojpuri

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,959
Commentary Bhojpuri Commentary on Jio Star

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,000
They do that too. He sent that reel to them and

93
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
He asks them, Sir, we can do such a big work

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
Have you given it? he didt even realise

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
what he did. and I I will tell you what

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Hee Done. he is not just scored runs and runs

97
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,840
Didn't make it, did not create an impact. I myself

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
I have been in rooms like that. This way

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,160
I have been in conversations wherever and whenever Bihar

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,919
When it came to cricket, he was very prominent

101
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,639
People of this country used to laugh. we are from bihar

102
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:37,120
Cricket. This one child tried to change his identity

103
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
He has tried to make us look at him, we are from Bihar

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,840
Come from. We have a lot of talent, we have a chance

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Give it to me. And that is why when this Mahendra

106
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,280
Singh touched Dhoni's feet after that game and

107
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,600
He came and we asked him, "Brother, you

108
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,560
he touched his feet what was that moment like and

109
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,880
He is so cute friend. he says he says bro

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,800
Now he is older than us, he has been watching us on TV since childhood

111
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,240
I have seen you, when I came in front of you I had to touch your feet

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,720
no it shows you the upbringing is well but is

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
Bihar cricket is now united because of a child

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,240
Bihar is going to organize T20 league. After

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,280
Wow and give children a chance to come and see

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Play, bring yourself to the big stage

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,840
could happen because of this one child

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,600
where there were many flaws that needed to be improved

119
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Those who run cricket should go there

120
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
I will not say anything dear friend, look a kid did this

121
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
naam roshan what kind of system do you create friend

122
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,479
How many children will we have in Bihar?

123
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,479
so ya this knock this

124
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,800
boy and i don't think he realises he is 14

125
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,120
he has no business realizing but he has done

126
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,400
A lot. he did a lot for bihar cricket and

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,720
Indian Cricket. When did he get the India cap?

128
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,320
Will I get it? I will get it soon. T20 is very soon

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
he just has to he is he is a part of

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,280
India under 19 now and he will have to go

131
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,759
Through that process. But bhai jitni hitting

132
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,000
He has the ability, why not? give him a

133
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,000
Go. We will of course have to approve your

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,639
you know what else we also asked them

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
Sidhu paaji and Bhajjupa were with me

136
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,520
Harbhajan Singh and Bhajjupa actually

137
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
I asked this question that this happened after IPL

138
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,000
kya and his words were amazing yaar 14

139
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,319
one year old child says sir ever since we played

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
I have understood this thing since I am in IPL

141
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,400
that if you want to keep playing at this level then you have to

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,680
Hard work will not make us work harder

143
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,759
If it happens sir then we have to work hard now sir

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,360
Understands

145
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,759
Brother, I told you in the beginning that

146
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,600
There must be characters. Yes. no to this

147
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
In basketball language it's called dog in

148
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
The Team. Yes. You Need a Dog in You Need a Dog

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,479
In the team. This is a compliment. 100%

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,600
It's a compliment, friends. don't cut and go

151
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,000
Give. Basically those people who work for their team

152
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Those who fight are called dogs. and and

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
this no and again something that your viewers

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,680
Will relate to. all of us boys we never thought of anything

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
Have played spot somewhere. We are all in teams

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,120
Sometimes you used to play in streets and malls also. one that

157
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,440
It used to happen. The one who gives the key

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,600
the other team had this but what a

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,199
Bowler man is also in this team and this is again

160
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,520
One of two IPL stories Lucknow Super

161
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,240
The Giants' go to spinner was Ravi Bishnoi

162
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,039
India's prominent T20 spinner Indian

163
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Prominent go to wrist of T20 team

164
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,360
Spinner Ravi Bishnoi has come into that team and

165
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,160
Outshining shows how much effort you put in

166
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,880
He was injured when he fell on the roof of his house

167
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,400
I had set up a gym in the 2020 lockdown

168
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,720
that friend if it is not working there then work hard here

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,960
I will keep on doing this, I will keep on considering myself a model

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
did sunil narayan pay and you are right i

171
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,520
Agri must be a man with some stubbornness

172
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,000
He told him to deduct his match fee, friend.

173
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,759
I want money and the beauty of IPL

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
That 3 months ago no one knew his name

175
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,400
I did not even know now he is a star of

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,319
Now you will probably never forget the Indian team

177
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,240
No, you will not forget, I mean if they ever

178
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,560
After this you did not even play a single IPL game

179
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,479
Even after 10 years, you will remember that they

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,680
One was cutting a slip and saying ok and something else

181
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,120
You would like to know beyond the slips about these

182
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,240
Is a very skillful bowler. I say this

183
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,000
Was gonna celebrate her with her antiques

184
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
Don't take his cricket away. His

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
Cricket is also with him. Doz

186
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
celebrations warrant themselves because they

187
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,360
He is such a good bowler. such a skillful bowler

188
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,199
Is. He deceives the batters. nice flats

189
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Also pays on tracks. So he has air

190
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,879
There is speed too. He has variations too. So

191
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
She's not the only Wonderlic Pony that she

192
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,520
He has become famous only because of the celebrations.

193
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,840
He has earned his name with his bowling.

194
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
Who do you remember watching his game? Sunil

195
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,120
Narayana in which he has modeled himself

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,360
To. But his personality is totally opposite. They

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,360
He doesn't speak and he doesn't keep quiet. Fire

198
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Sunil Narayan with fire. Ok.

199
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:25,599
Moving on. Next a cute sweet moment. Or

200
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,919
A I think this is almost everyone's favourite now

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,160
Have become a player. favorite player for a

202
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,680
Lots of Indian fans. like he bats

203
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,120
Friend means some players and well whatever is good

204
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
You always keep batting when you see him

205
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,080
You think that you should see it some more. But there is something in it

206
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,200
yes friend. just swing the bat and of course the

207
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,279
Under the mentorship of the great Yuvraj Singh

208
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,600
If they come then there is some flare of UVPA

209
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,680
also comes. but i still think there will

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,399
forever be only one yuvraj singh in the

211
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,880
World. But he is very special. he is very

212
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,560
Very special man. I hope we say in the

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
The future that there will only be one anointment

214
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,959
Sharma. One 100% One 100% Fingers crossed.

215
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
Fingers crossed. A little more consistency

216
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,800
Friend Abhishek Sharma, I saw a little more

217
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,640
The way they play the game, they have so much in it

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
The risk is that they expect consistency

219
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
It is unfair to do this but we are fans, friend

220
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,800
Do it when you get to see such good batting

221
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,320
It seems that we may keep on seeing more but yes,

222
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,279
So here I would like to manifest

223
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,080
I'll make it two because their blood is orange

224
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
Do you know about the fan base of RCB?

225
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,320
Let's talk about the fan base of CS MI

226
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,880
Fan Base We Should Talk About Orange Army or

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,200
I think this is a very strong building up right now

228
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,360
And this isn't the only fan base? of course

229
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,959
Sunrisers Hyderabad's fan base is solid,

230
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,360
It's Growing and We See That in the Numbers

231
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,160
Everywhere as well. There is another team that

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,560
The fan base is growing. Very passionate, very

233
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,519
He is loud and increasingly very loyal

234
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,480
Punjab. Hmm!

235
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,200
Oh! or and his team has earned it

236
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,120
Love. But Punjab fan has become comfortable suddenly

237
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,680
In the base. Absolutely and it is a good thing

238
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,160
You want IPL. Yes.

239
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,839
I want someone who can be mine. So happy for Punjab.

240
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,760
why do you think that it just picked up like this

241
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,320
Does Punjab have a fan base? maybe i think

242
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,040
Arshdeep Rab Simran who are local boys. that that

243
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,920
That must be one reason but the performances

244
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,240
Salutes the . duniya it's a winner

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,920
S. Well. Right? Stories that win

246
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
Writes in his own way. Mumbai Indians,

247
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,040
The fan base of Chennai Super Kings is so

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
Why are they big? because they won

249
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,519
Has registered. There is one outlier in this, it is

250
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,480
Royal Challengers Bangalore. it's not a trophy

251
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,480
It has come for them but there are two factors there

252
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,079
Are. One is that man factor. you a million something

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,279
Just say it. I have lived in this country, in this world,

254
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,399
I've been to many places but haven't seen such love

255
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,839
Buddy. I of course did the great Sachin

256
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,519
I had heard about Tendulkar and was very excited for him.

257
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,079
It might be love, but I was not there then

258
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,120
On the plains. Love for Virat Kohli is different

259
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,800
it is in this country. brother o man they are just and

260
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
Not just in this country. I told this story

261
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,720
Actually, I mentioned it on my Instagram as well

262
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,240
He was in New York and when we arrived

263
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
If not on that ground then that stadium would still be built

264
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,560
I was there three-four days before the match

265
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,040
NYD of the New York Police Department

266
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
an officer of the team was standing and our match

267
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
there are many photographers

268
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,839
Photographers are big media

269
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,720
When they leave their houses they are police officers

270
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,360
He asks him where is Virat Kohli and I

271
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
I was standing there watching this Virat Kohli

272
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,640
don't expect because when we go to New York

273
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,320
When you went there the biggest thing was that

274
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
People were entered, what is cricket?

275
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
Nobody knows except the local people

276
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,399
so draw them parallel to the baseball

277
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
tell me tell me this then you suddenly and this and this

278
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,959
It is not that the police is of Indian origin

279
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,480
He was an officer. This white man was a police officer.

280
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,440
He says where is Virat Kohli? where is

281
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,320
Virat Kohli? So he says he will train

282
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,920
Had been. says there is what my kids told

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,480
Me War. they said get a picture with virat

284
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,880
Kohli. Imagine. He is a global icon man.

285
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,320
At a NYPD police officer's home

286
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,079
When the police officer would have said that I will not

287
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
His duty is on the ground. have some cricket

288
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,000
He is living there. Cricket is happening now.

289
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,640
Come and meet Virat Kohli. hmm imagine the

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,720
Conversations in a New York Household. hmm

291
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,399
That is what Virat Kohli is. he is

292
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,920
Problem became the face of global cricket.

293
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,800
one 100% that's exactly what I

294
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,600
Said that if global cricket means the Olympics

295
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,920
The committee said no they made him the poster boy

296
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,720
when they announced that cricket is going to

297
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,480
The Olympics. So that is RCB's fan base

298
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
One of course because of Virat Kohli. But

299
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,560
Outside of Virat Kohli also friend. Previous

300
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,480
The year his team won the Women's Team he

301
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,600
The roads are packed, friend. I said this before

302
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,680
She has also said, brother I am a friend outside Chinswami

303
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
The signal is of Caban Park metro station

304
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,760
I've been standing outside there, and I've

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
I have seen the team coming to practice for the match

306
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,160
one day before two days before brother three-three

307
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,079
4- Four thousand people were watching the team's bus on that footpath

308
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,680
The team bus is standing to watch and

309
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,000
When the poor thing comes in the sun, he puts up curtains

310
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,639
They give it to the players just to watch

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,120
They are standing there cheering for them, there is no such love

312
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,880
brother i saw it somewhere so that is rcb is

313
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,399
an outlier in terms of a fan base and this

314
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
It is not just in Bangalore, you can go anywhere

315
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
late rcb fans everywhere hmm it's i

316
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
think it's got to do with the band of

317
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,519
cricket that they play they play a very

318
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,440
Attractive brand of which is which is

319
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,040
what attacking we were very batting heavy and

320
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,079
That's why that was always a complaint of mine

321
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,519
RCB is so batting heavy that bowling

322
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,200
I never paid any attention to it and that is why I came

323
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
think that was a big reason why those trophies

324
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,880
I have been saying since the beginning that she has not come this season

325
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,360
yes this is a bowling attack, we should take care of it

326
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,040
ok this man a little bit about him

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,279
I have to do it, even if we have already spoken

328
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,200
I know about him as much as any nerd out there

329
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,880
They are cricket fans, they are important

330
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,079
I recognize it. they understand what shreyas

331
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,760
Ayer is both as a better and as a potential

332
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,920
Captain says that every format is different

333
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,760
There will be captains. yes definitely my pick

334
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,279
for odi at least why not why not

335
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,920
So he has shown everything to himself

336
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,360
In captaincy. what in white ball cricket

337
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,600
Do you expect from a captain? As

338
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,160
I have spoken to many of our cricketers

339
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,079
See you when we do shows on Star.

340
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,760
So I talk to him a lot off air and I

341
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,120
keep talking to them about captaincy northern

342
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,639
They always say no to Test cricket, it's a

343
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,120
There is a different pace to the game in T20

344
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,040
It happens immediately brother if three runs are scored in one over

345
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,880
hit fours hit four fours suddenly 16

346
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,800
The runs have come, you are under pressure, now the game is on

347
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,040
The game was with us till four balls before the end

348
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,320
was gone now thinking on your feet Shreyas

349
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,320
Iyer has done that right by managing the team we are

350
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,360
We were talking a while back about six years ago

351
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,839
Take four teams to the playoffs

352
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,240
It cannot be a fluke that we spent those four years

353
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,920
I won the trophy one year. one year finals

354
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,920
I took it. Delhi in the finals in 2020

355
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I had taken it. This year it has taken me to the top two.

356
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,320
So this year too there is a chance of reaching the finals.

357
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,160
So that's why he is making a team as well.

358
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
He is keeping his people comfortable

359
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
nearby. And this is my personal experience

360
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,519
Let me tell you. He is a solid guy. Solid

361
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Cow. You will get it once, won't you and

362
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,160
he got this. this vibe about him that's you

363
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,160
Might be seen in the videos and it's not known

364
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,720
don't know fresh air. but he is a darling

365
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,040
Buddy. Really a good song.

366
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,920
you feel very brotherly, brother is coming, brother is there

367
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,839
Mine is like that. i genuinely hope as mi

368
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,240
Fan that mi won but as a pure

369
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,720
Objective Cricket Fan I would love to see

370
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,600
Shreyas Iyer Winning an Executive Trophy

371
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,920
With another team story the whole country should recognize

372
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,959
this is some special cricket mind you too

373
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,959
Tell me, I get inspiration from them.

374
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,800
I have a very big brother yes the best player of Indian cricket

375
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,440
Hardik is one of the cutest guys

376
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,320
Pandya is one of the most misunderstood guys

377
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,240
One is Hardik Pandya and

378
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,800
Before we talk about this comparison, I

379
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,880
Let me tell you a story, I

380
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,720
The first time I met him was a long time ago, then this

381
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,560
I was an intern somewhere and not a presenter

382
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
I was doing an internship in Mumbai Indians

383
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,320
I was a camera intern, a production intern

384
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,000
I used to do everything, set up the camera, do the sound

385
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
I used to do everything, I met him there for the first time

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,279
then when i started working for star

387
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,959
I Met Him A Couple Of Times And And Bhai

388
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,120
He is Hardik Pandya, how many times a day does he

389
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,399
He would meet people on one of his warm

390
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,880
Up Lapse in the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka itself

391
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,800
came to say hi to ravi shastri with whom

392
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,240
I was doing a show, I said hi to Ravi

393
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,480
Shastri had no business, he said hi to him

394
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,040
Who am I, my friend, could I have just stopped

395
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,800
show me your hands with me you remember my name only

396
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,759
I had no business remembering my name

397
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,600
no, he is hardik pandya and he

398
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,440
His mark is that he is such a person

399
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,759
I will meet you once, after that when

400
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
If you meet him again, he will remember your name.

401
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,040
He remembers something you said last time

402
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,279
And how many people does this guy meet?

403
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,639
will be. that's why and I was actually in 204

404
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,240
In that first game where he was booked for the toss

405
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,920
but and i actually put it up on

406
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,160
Instagram Yes well that's enough now friend

407
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,680
Bullying is happening. now you bully him

408
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,480
had been. it was that game where sanjay

409
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,480
Manjrekar had said behave at the toss. His

410
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,399
bad for him to come back this season and do

411
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,360
This with the team. Same thing is with this one too, right?

412
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,639
500 people are saying you are a cheater

413
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
you did this you did that ok i will come

414
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,320
I will show you the time and this fight has happened

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
This is not the first time I have fought in my life

416
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,800
This battle has been fought many times

417
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,480
destiny's child hardik pandya or no

418
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,440
Actually some things happened in his life

419
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,199
Last year, we were outside the ground as well

420
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,680
The document has been made face some very serious

421
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,000
Financial Situation as Well and After

422
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,519
After that winning T20 World Cup bouncing

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,079
Back Mumbai Indians Captain So much has happened.

424
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,000
I think in the coming 10 years people will

425
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,799
You will actually recognize greatness. Give

426
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
understand what he or 100% and and the

427
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,319
The best part about him is that in life

428
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,400
Whatever is going on in my life, I am so self-reliant

429
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,199
I have never met such a confident guy. Brother

430
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,439
talk to them anytime, yes i like it

431
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,000
he genuinely believes that he can do this

432
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,679
can do anything from anywhere

433
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,600
And when that kind of faith is there within a person

434
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,679
no end of course you could see that last season

435
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,120
It seemed that there was a crack in that trust

436
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,440
I came but he was so quick to wrap that up

437
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,600
Go to the T20 World Cup, play like he did

438
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,280
And I was actually there in Babidos when

439
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,840
He was bowling the last ball and this was our end

440
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,160
We were pouring it since we were standing on the ground

441
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,799
and you could see him and you watch him on TV

442
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,320
I was just tearing myself up but I was

443
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,480
It's not that he didn't understand her

444
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,880
What should I do? he circled around twice

445
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,160
At his bowling mark. he was so scared

446
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,520
He is not the kind of person who would burst out crying.

447
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
he's just waiting for me to get this ball

448
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,440
daalun because it was that big a moment for

449
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,919
Snow. what he had suffered in the last three-four months

450
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,200
I remained silent on this through those three-four months.

451
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,799
To let his performance do the talking.

452
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
When your life was going difficult. TRAI

453
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,840
Remembering what Hardik Pandya's life is

454
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,080
Was in 2024 o even before that dude. Even

455
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,760
Before that in Baroda he himself said this

456
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,440
Told that his father's fine flourishing

457
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,919
It was business. Then suddenly everything stopped.

458
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,679
There to live in a one BHK. ₹2 for ₹200

459
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,840
Hardik and Krunal went to Baroda for this

460
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,440
Used to play matches. Money for food after the match

461
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,240
If it was not there, we would ask the gardener to heat the water

462
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,240
Do it. We used to make Maggi in it. And they used to eat more.

463
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,200
And I I have said this so many times. Today

464
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,360
You can see Philip Richards in your hand

465
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Is. That gene is visible today. today that range

466
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,720
Rovers are visible. But then this fellow

467
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,039
Worked hard when no one was watching. Currenty

468
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,039
Max

469
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,799
And now when Hardik Pandya bats

470
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,200
or do you go bowling it's always with

471
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,200
Lots of Ora or Taxes Over the Whole Ground

472
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,360
correct correct I don't know that ora maybe from last

473
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
has come from a whole year's adventure or what have I

474
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,080
don't know but what is the story or else is the story

475
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,240
Everything is created by your perception, your aura

476
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,000
If the story is to be made then last season is something else

477
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,840
There was a story, then there was something else this season's story

478
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
there is something else, something else is moving on

479
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,480
Oye yaar what have you shown me that's why we

480
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,919
that white today

481
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,559
As an edge as a tribute. Yeah. What to say

482
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,880
you would want it because for ours

483
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,039
generation this is

484
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,600
like it it defines our entire

485
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,160
Existence over the last 15 years. and you

486
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,880
No what I mean I can say it now. I

487
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,520
New of it a little bit already. that the

488
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,039
Retirement Was

489
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,039
Coming. So difficult to digest.

490
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,000
because and this is something that i said when

491
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,280
he retired

492
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,120
Also. in the last 1015 years since

493
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,000
Actually it has been 10 years since he started taking the test

494
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,080
This guy took the captaincy of Test cricket

495
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,679
Made it attractive again. me and you genji

496
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Let's talk about it. We talk about attention span

497
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,960
We do. Average watch on both of us content

498
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,799
Monitor the time. There is no attention

499
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Brother. And Test cricket needs attention

500
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,360
I definitely need it. hmm such a long whole day

501
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,480
If watching a test match is interesting

502
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,400
If this does not happen, a new generation will not see the mistake

503
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,160
He will get this much access to T20 cricket

504
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,039
That one guy will only watch T20 cricket

505
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,080
just him alone along side his team of

506
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,400
Of course but he took the initiative that such cricket

507
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,880
I will play so that you all can see it because the test

508
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
Cricket was his priority and I

509
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,320
I have seen it with my own eyes. we are from south africa

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,360
I was in Centurion for practice

511
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,760
Aya and all the players practice.

512
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
And I saw him before the T20 game as well

513
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,039
I have seen him practising. Even before the ODIs

514
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,200
I have seen him practising. brother from test match

515
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,520
First this guy polishes his white pads

516
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,679
Is. That tissue is not available. Wet Tissue

517
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,600
Shining the white pads with it. White His Thing

518
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,919
is that all my whites are absolutely white

519
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,480
Needed that is how much he loves to test

520
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,679
Cricket. and which is why i think this

521
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,880
Decisions like these are very difficult for fans to take. But

522
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,640
How difficult it must have been for them. and I

523
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,240
I had thought about it. It was not coming out from inside

524
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,240
100% we will end it but it is very difficult friend

525
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,679
This is what kept Test cricket alive in the last 10

526
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,760
Over the years, I have only developed my attacking instinct

527
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,440
The way he was on the field and the way he was

528
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,600
that he had formed the team under his captaincy

529
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,880
I am just on the strength of that or you know obviously

530
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,520
Their techniques, their records are very

531
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,840
Everyone will remember but what he has done

532
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,320
From a mentality perspective as a whole

533
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:31,120
For all the people born between generations

534
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:34,480
I would say from 1990 to 2010. Correct. Perhaps

535
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,480
2015. Yes. Correct. All the inspiration is from them

536
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,039
Let's take it. i actually feel bad for the

537
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,240
Kids who won't be able to watch in playing.

538
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,720
that's exactly what i said that

539
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,320
Because a generation will come in the next 10-15 years

540
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,840
I will say that even test runs are 10,000

541
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,520
It doesn't have it. The average is not even 50. So

542
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,760
Brother he is a great player. 15

543
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,760
Players who have scored 10,000 Test runs

544
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,200
in Test history. why talk about him

545
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,120
yes? This is the case with I think average

546
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Any player who has played minimum 40 tests

547
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,799
These are the good benchmarks. this is it

548
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,960
46 and 47 on that

549
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,559
List. Which is why, yours, mine and all of ours

550
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,559
Who has seen Virat Kohli work

551
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,760
gotta remind them what he did

552
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,240
Was. This marked the 10-year period where T20

553
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,480
Cricket was fierce and was at the peak of its

554
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,840
Power. Therein lies the sexy aspect of Test cricket.

555
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,919
Created it, made it attractive, kept it alive. whenever

556
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,039
He and his team played Test cricket,

557
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,520
you had no option to tune in because you

558
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,840
New that he will do something special on the field.

559
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,600
It kept Test cricket alive. Average of 50

560
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,679
Did not reach 10,000 Test runs. No problem

561
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,120
It kept Test cricket alive for 10 years. Self

562
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,679
How will you explain Virat Kohli to the kids?

563
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,159

Everybody gets inspired. Will do fitness, gym

That day, you start lying to me

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,799
I don't feel like going. I have to go to the gym. If

595
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,640
It is part of my work. if I stay fit

596
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,039
I have made a resume for myself

597
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,600
I have to go. That is Kohli. that is how

598
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,520
To Tell the Children About Ko. Exactly.

599
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,000
you know when I make steamed vegetables and

600
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm eating steamed tofu around me

601
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,559
people give me sad vibes what

602
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,400
What kind of a life am I having? But somewhere I

603
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,000
I know when I'm eating all this

604
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
Virat Kohli's soul is happy somewhere

605
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,240
Is. 100% or 100% and that's that's something

606
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,559
What you said is a revolution.

607
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,200
Actually he did it only in cricket

608
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,440
No, for all of us. in fitness india

609
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,600
fitness drive came in people that they will do this

610
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,520
Yes, I will stop eating dirty food. She came because of them

611
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,840
From. His treadmill videos and clean

612
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,840
End jerk videos have influenced an entire generation

613
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,679
Get two prints from Man Sins.

614
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,000
or very curious to see what's coming

615
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,919
How will generations remember them? I think

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
it will be it will be down to a lot of us

617
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,600
To tell those stories as well. They have their own

618
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,159
The story had to be written, I have written it. Now a little

619
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,640
I will write. Hmm. Now is our time Stories

620
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,880
To tell. I know it's unfair to ask this.

621
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,840
But his shadow can be seen in some young player

622
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,840
Is. Mentality wise. Everyone is so different

623
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,640
And now it's entirely different

624
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,520
If you actually say generation then it is visible in all of you

625
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,960
That fitness, that discipline of every kind

626
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,559
discipline like all of them will now sleep

628
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,679
are all so fast they have worked on there

629
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
Speed ​​because I work at the speed of said speed

630
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,080
is a must. so you saw a lot of them

631
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,240
Even Shubhaman Yashasvi is so athletic, so fit,

632
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,159
so fast and an entire new generation that's

633
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,559
Coming in, they are all the same. give and take

634
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,159
All very athletic. Hmm. So, actually everything

635
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,640
It is visible only in. has he changed cricket

636
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,760
Forever? Certain aspects of it? Yes.

637

Fitness 100%, speed 100% which way

638
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,520
You should make demands on yourself as

639
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,200
Cricketer 100%? And for which player?

640
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,679

They are coming, right? One is the great Sachin Tendulkar

Go and attack that era without a helmet

647
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,600
That pitch where there was so much grass

648
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,559
Where the ball used to go from here

649
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,120
Malcolm Marshall was always ready to kill

650
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,799

Banana that time it was unheard of it

653
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,520

Got something about him. or when he runs

If he makes it then he will make it in so much that it will bother him

667
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,159
It will be the opposing team. what to do friend

668
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Stop this? He has that hunger. It is visible.

669
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,279
Ok moving on.

670
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,080
What? There is hunger in these, there is hunger in these.

671
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:02,000
correct i i am very happy with the taste

672
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,320
If captaincy ends this season then

673
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,080
You should listen to him at the toss, post the game

674
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,840
Listen, we all need to remember that this

675
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,440
He is only 25 years old. so much maturity in this

676
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,799
Even before the start of the season, he had contacted Jio

677
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,799
gave an interview to the star itself and in that

678
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,320
He said last season I

679
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,320
Thinking a lot about captaincy

680
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,159
Was. This season I thought nothing of it

681
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,679
I will think about it. I will just react to the game going

682
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,720
out there don't take a lot of pressure and you

683
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,880
Can see that it has changed itself and 24-25

684
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,520
at the age of one year, that kind of

685
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,400
Making changes is not easy. Hum And Still

686
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,679
performing s about and what

687
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,600
It is said that you should score 100% runs, isn't it?

688
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,679
don't take the pressure of captaincy, it comes to an end

689
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,679
Captaincy is like so many eye balls

690
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,520
there is perfection pressure 100% that is

691
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,240
says something about know in cricket circles

692
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,799
People say that this is a robot, that means

693
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,640
The extent to which their training has been completed

694
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,360
That is what I am saying, all that means his

695
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,080
Of course with his batting and all but that

696
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,320
The entire new generation is like this

697
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,080
but what is their specialty according to

698
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,000
you your you are actually observing cricket

699
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,320
De India very level headed and still very

700
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,120
Hungry means it is quiet hunger right?

701
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,159
Like of course Virat is the king and he has many

702
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,399
Has been given the status of Prince for quite some time

703
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,679
His hunger is very quiet, he is very hungry

704
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,960
man brother this

705
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,640
There are two types of people who like one

706
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,640
He will say it is good if he gets the Test captaincy

707
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,799
He has got the Test captaincy, ok ok

708
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,720
Will get Test captaincy, will say all right

709
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,840
Test captaincy has been given in five Test matches

710
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,600
let's go one of those people we one of those

711
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,480
People he I am sure he is looking forward to

712
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,480
To this and fingers crossed it does wonders yaar

713
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,880
In England. The new face of Indian Test cricket

714
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,120
Era needs such a strong pillar

715
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,360
In the middle, around whom the team is formed. Gill

716
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,360
has all the makings of it. all the makings

717
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,279
Of It Across All Formats. Meaning Test

718
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,159
Specially in cricket. and i don't know there

719
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,000
I have some gut feeling like this

720
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:58,320
that he is very suited to that number four in

721
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,720
Test. I think I think or I think and s

722
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,960
I said he likes big moments

723
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,640
Responsibilities: Virat Kohli at number four

724
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,279
I have gone, he wants me to go now and

725
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,200
I'll make a name for myself I think that happens

726
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,240
moving on

727
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,720
O man incredible yes he also did IPL

728
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Another hero actually friend and this one too said no

729
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,080
The same problem was with them that many

730
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,760
Sometimes it's more about your insides than the outside

731
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,440
The voice becomes your enemy and they

732
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,080
anywhere before this season that now I am not me

733
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,720
no thinking i am not thinking of tearing it

734
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,159
I will go and kill you, whatever happens will be seen. I called

735
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,919
this face of his the mahabharat hair face

736
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,840
Mahabharat is lovely I but I genuinely feel

737
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,960
There is something spiritual about them, due to which

738
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,360
Something has changed I think Sunil Shetty

739
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
He came to our show on Jio Star for a few days

740
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,960
first and we asked him this question also at the end

741
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,120
said he just wants to let go let go

742
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,039
a lot of times it happens like i said

743
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,640
Nor does your inner voice become your shackles

744
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,480
I should do it like this I should do it like this

745
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,720
It is my responsibility, this is what I like and

746
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,200
Despite all that, he scores 500 runs in almost every season

747
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,799
We were making it but this season we unleashed it

748
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,840
He gave his and other cricketer

749
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,600
is appreciated by the nerds yes those who

750
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,159
Everybody understands cricket

751
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,520
appreciate correct correct we understand the

752
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,320
Diamond we have in front of us and because

753
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,200
How much role does this test play for the team

754
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,159
He has also batted at number six in the team five times

755
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,960
I have batted at the crease and also opened the innings. When

756
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,399
I have also done wicket keeping when required. this season

757
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Also for Delhi Capitals. he said

758
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,760
You can play on four, I will play. please open it

759
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:41,120
I will do it. You just keep it up, I will do it. All

760
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:45,360
He does everything. Ok moving on.

761
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,360
what did he even say? What a guy he is! or or 2007

762
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,960
Remember the T20 World Cup when this number came to my mind

763
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,720
It used to come at six. Or they would come at six. South

764
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,919
Played a very good knock against Africa

765
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,600
Was. Very good favorite of the match. yes and now

766
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,520
They we have a Rohit Sharma stand or imagine

767
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,159
what a story what a story and theirs too

768
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,559
It's been a very crazy journey, like we remember

769
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,919
The Recent Past T20 World Cup Captaincy

770
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,960
etc but he was only in 2011 World Cup

771
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,200
drop from the drop down a lot

772
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,320
There have been downs in their early journey

773
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,000
there are and means now this is a little more

774
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,000
Refresher courses have to be given because every

775
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,799
The year begins to see a new generation

776
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,360
Cricket was tagged on him

777
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,720
there are a lot of young kids listening to

778
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,679
For them, they had a tag that these

779
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,080
He is very talented. hmm make this many runs

780
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,919
some played talented but that's it that was

781
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,080
Rohit Sharma's definition and I think he said

782
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,080
This is on Breakfast with Champions Earnley

783
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,559
he said that friend I am tired friend

784
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,360
don't say talented talented my friend that's it

785
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,480
is that right and it took him so

786
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Many years to prove that he is far superior to that

787
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,200
I am one of the sharpest brains in

788
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,039
I am cricket, I am in white ball cricket

789
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
As if you haven't seen the captain anywhere else

790
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,159
Ofcourse batting is a blessing from the God

791
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,640
friend what a better option is there on them but they need time

792
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,960
It took me to break those perceptions, those beliefs

793
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,000
In breaking, about myself. Indian

794
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,360
Cricket Legend Mumbai Cricket Legend

795
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,760

Amazing person. I said no, I told you at many places.

799
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,919
I was an intern at Mumbai Indians

800
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,919
I accidentally spilled coffee on him.

801
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,279
Hot coffee and they are getting ready to go somewhere

802
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,799
Were. I was interviewing him and so

803
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,519
There was a small table. The smaller the table is

804
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,159
Yours. So that's how I put the mic on it

805
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,679
There was a zoom mic that comes, I had kept it

806
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,200
This is for backup audio with handheld phone

807
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,919
I had kept it with me and there was a phone in it

808
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,919
There were questions and a camera was set up

809
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,519
And in a hurry, the coffee spilled on him

810
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,519
There was someone with him in his team, he told me

811
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:44,640
I scolded you a lot friend and I was 21 in

2017 or I am Rome I said career [ __ ]

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,200

817
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,440
Ask your problem, ask your question. save my career

818
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,360
That's it. Wow! have you ever met him and

819
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,760
Told him. Quiet a few times. I I

820
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,760
Just I Met Him After the T-20 World Cup

821
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,080
After the Indian team was partying and they

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,360
We were kind enough to let us in. so meet there

823
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,360
There we were and I just couldn't mean them

824
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,120
I got it and nothing came out except thank you.

825
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,559
and I told him that because he

826
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,919
People were very busy. after that i don't

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,000
Think they check social media and all. I slept

828
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,760
Told him that Rohit bhai you might know

829
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,360
No, you have given me so much happiness. How many?

830
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,960
Thank you very much to the people for that.

831
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,039
hey friend come friend

832
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Between the media team and the Indian cricket team

833
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,840
What do you talk about? Media Team As N Us

834
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,559
Broadcasters yes yes it's pretty normal

835
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,320
Yaar we meet we talk to them like anyone else

836
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,880
If someone meets you, how do they ask you about your well being?

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,600

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,679
I do not do it because in that zone and specially

841
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,840
When we meet, it is usually on the grounds

842
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,320
When we meet there friend, he is in a zone

843
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,320
Are you preparing for your game? Unless you are there

844

We are interviewing them, so they must have come

Will brief them that I will ask these four questions

846

I am gonna is that okay do you want to ask

847
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,720
Something else. But not her other dream

848

Job. It is a dream job. 100% 100% 1% A

849
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,440
Dream job dude. They can't have it any other way.

850
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:15,599
Ok moving on.

851
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:19,440
Ok Tiwari brother. So much has been said.

852
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,839
In my eyes regarding this topic because we

853
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,119
Saw the entire career of MS Dhoni. From

854
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,839
2004. That's correct. ah this is one of those

855
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,480
Situations where I won't pass any comment

856
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,119
Out of respect. Beans. and this to me

857
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,879
had asked this just now in our Jio Star

858
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,879
Those from our social media team come

859
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,839
This has to be done. And I can't say that, friend.

860
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,359
I can't say anything because it

861
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,760
again this is something in which I have not said anything

862
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,919
A day ago I had created a content that a whole

863
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,839
This cannot be a legacy for generations.

864
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,919
Of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Hmm. Dude, you and

865
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,320
I have seen it since 2004 as you said.

866
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,639
We have seen that phase when till MS Dhoni

867
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,359
You used to feel this on the ground, right?

868
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,880
I used to believe that whatever the situation may be, brother

869
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,079
This will change the game. as long as Dhoni is there

870
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,800
It's a match. Trust is his legacy. faith

871
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,640
That's his legacy. This legacy may be a little

872
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,560
It is brother Singh Dhoni's. and again it's one

873
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,520
Those things we need to be reminded of

874
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,119
To the people.

875
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,240
on a more personal level the kind of happiness

876
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,599
I felt it in 2007 and in 2011

877
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,440
Probably two of the happiest moments

878
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,119
of yes 100% 100% means my complete human

879
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,880
I did not feel so happy in the journey

880
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,800
I mean I'm not married, I have kids

881
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,640
no so maybe that will break it but up

882
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,359
Till I Should Actually Get Married

883
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,680
then get married

884
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:39,680
go but because of those two moments ya ya

885
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,839
no very happy or no and whatever about them

886
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,440
branding image it's all going to be the

887
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,240
Same I am always going to remember the Dhoni

888
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,240
who one the world cup how yes one 100% but me

889
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,160
I am saying this for a new generation now you

890
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,839
Imagine, there are many children who were

891
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,160
He is also eight years old since he was born. Now they have

892
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,160
This is his first or second IPL. we are like that

893
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,560
I am watching Dhoni and they will look at me

894
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,200
People like you and me what's the hype about

895
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,040
this guy man look at vaibhav suryavanshi isn't

896
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,040
he better end or vaibhav suryavanshi is

897
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,240
Promising

898
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,240
But he is a magician, he has done magic in the field

899
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,400
Pay Age Captain s Batter T20 World Cup 2016

900
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,880
Do you remember that game against Bangladesh?

901
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,320
We ran in at the end and ran him out.

902
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,480
Hmm it was his genius.

903
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Do you remember this? Everything yes. Ball of the

904
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,400
Tournament. Yeah, from the outside Rohit

905
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,480
Singh applied the spinner, the ball has changed. Both

906
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,000
A spinner was hit from the end. Karan Sharma and Santner

907
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,160
Both picked up wickets. and Mumbai Indians

908
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,320
The trajectory also changed after this ball.

909
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Delhi's situation also changed. Right? Delhi Vent

910
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,920
On to lose so many after this. I think

911
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,839
Delhi won its next game and then

912
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,200
Then she kept losing. I saw their name

913
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,839
In MI's auction list. i was like this

914
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,760
Is this great. very intelligent very

915
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,160
Intelligent bowlers don't deny it after seeing them

916
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Vettori's memory of course correct same like

917
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,440
correct way ok moving on

918
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,200
Low risk cricket is the theme of the

919
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,440
tournament tan bhai they have made it cool into

920
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,440
there or they made it as their USP that you

921
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,240
people are saying

922
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,040
Maybe something is not right outside the top three

923
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,119
You are saying that you will not cross the top three

924
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,440
Go and show it and this has happened many times

925
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,079
Teams but more of course not Gujarat Titans

926
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,200
top three specially these two just bat

927
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,960
Bat and Bat and Batman just don't stop.

928
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,079
The opposing bowling team will get worried, friend.

929
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,480
And what you said is take risk cricket with fours

930
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,000
Runs are also scored. hit two sixes in the air

931
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
I am getting extra runs. how will

932
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,880
We look back at this season where the same team

933
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,440
Two people are number one and number two is Orange Cap

934
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,599
Table. Dominance man. Opening Pair Is Number

935
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,119
One and number. or it's just sure

936
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,440
Dominance. He is remembered for his dominance

937
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,160
I will keep it. wouldn't mind seeing them open in all

938
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,880
Three formats together. not open.

939
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,839
Or I am not sure about the Indian T20 team

940
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,920
There are many contenders there too. Butt or

941
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,839
Butt test in ODI test why not test

942
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,599
I am number four friend Gill I don't even think

943
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,480
is leaving that spot now but I think they

944
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,920
will be three formats

945
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,599
Both teammates are three format players

946
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,599
Are.

947
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,400
Or will it be difficult in the Indian T20 team

948
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,920
Perhaps. If I am being very honest. Just

949
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,000
Because of the number quality friend. so many

950
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,079
They are following behind. in the Indian T20 team

951
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,200
It will be difficult. ODI in test match then ODI in test match

952
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,839
test locked 100% teammates 100% ok end

953
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,079
This could possibly be the opening pair in ODIs

954
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,880
In the future why not ODI can be made

955
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,560
is it or can it be made in ODI we give

956
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,240
something special about them s up pairing

957
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,839
Sometimes compliments are given in sports

958
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,560
Another Very Well Dwayne Wade Lebron

959
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:39,599
James and who else has been Rui Ronaldo so sai

960
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,760
Sudarshan and Shubman Gill together with Sachin Wright

961
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,480
also called tamil guys and punjabi

962
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,880
Guys Get Along Is It Ya Stereo Alright

963
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:52,320
ok understand each alright manifestation you

964
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,160
Go all right ok Tanay bhai it's very round

965
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,680
this is us a we now

966
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,480
Predict by looking at the tree of plays

967
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,480
we will decide who will win the IPL let's go ok

968
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,200
round by round let's begin with

969
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,839
qualifier one punjab vs rcb what

970
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,480
a story man this season actually when all four

971
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,160
Even if it qualifies, then Punjab and Punjab

972
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,320
Yet you may be writing a qualifier

973
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,320
One man for RCB to come here because GT

974
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,920
Lost that game key game against Chennai Super

975
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:24,200
Kings Wow

976
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:27,359
Prediction Punjab RCB Qualifier One I

977
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:30,640
think it's very difficult in mullapur

978
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,280
Is. Punjab is not doing well in Mullapur

979
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,880
Pie is this season's qualifier one in

980
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,920
Mullapur Against RCB

981
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,160
I am back RCB really or Mullapur because

982
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,839
It's Mullapur but Punjab is also amazing friend

983
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,920
it's so difficult to pick up if a pick

984
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,640
If you want to do it then the momentum is with Punjab

985
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,320
A little bit of I know or but RCB also has it

986
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,040
We have the momentum, we defeated Lucknow Super Giants

987
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,920
In the last game

988
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,760
Punjab has Priyansh Arya Priyansh

989
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,359
There is power and glory. Below is Arshdeep. You

990
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
Wood hope Chahal comes back. a little bit

991
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,920
He had a finger injury. Shashank Singh Shashank

992
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,359
This is a meme of Singh. Shashank Singh himself is there, friend.

993
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,359
Shashank Singh himself is doing wonders.

994
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,119
Or I still from RCB in Mullapur.

995
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,800
something about that ground punjab very

996
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,480
She is not doing well there. do you think

997
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,480
Will RCBS experience be like past Punjab?

998
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,320
I think we thought that against Mumbai also.

999
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,240
And the Mumbai experience was wiped out

1000
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,400
It was Punjab. So I think the experience is out

1001
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,800
Off the window. I think just RCB in guys

1002
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,160
Conditions might be a better suited team. so all

1003
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
in all its unpredictable but you you you you you you

1004
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,040
You RCB. very unpredictable but

1005
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,520
RCB. or ok ah ok that takes us to the

1006
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,640
Eliminator. or rcb goes straight into the

1007
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,800
Final Eliminator GT

1008
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,880
Mi Because GT has suffered two major setbacks

1009
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,000
As do Buttler and Rabada. not both

1010
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,079
Will be. am i not missing a lot and they are

1011
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,720
Hurting and they know how to play big games.

1012
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,839
They just have that big big game muscle memory.

1013
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,599
MI will be. Same MI without it out. MI its

1014
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,200
an eliminator definitely MI because I

1015
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,440
A role of genuinely felt experience

1016
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,200
It happens. Or correct in correct offs. every

1017
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,960
It happens in sports, it happens 100%. Muscle

1018
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,520
There is memory in it, so many other things

1019
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,720
It just exists as a team but that team

1020
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,319
Look at me Rohit Sharma, Hardik

1021
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,960
Pandya, Surya Kumar Yadav, Jaspreet

1022
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,720
Bumrah there are so many of them. Like

1023
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,319
If there is any young player in the ground, he

1024
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,480
If he looks anywhere, he will see a man like this

1025
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,000
whoever knows will go then now when he

1026
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,119
If he sees that this is work then I will too

1027
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,599
I just keep working. no such problem

1028
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,880
Hui. That's up, yah. Hmm or for me it's

1029
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:37,599
like a 90% am I win but you never know

1030
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,920
And of course you never know whether Shubman Gill is

1031
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,720
A point to prove as a captain you never know

1032
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,000
but ya you back just on pure logic you back

1033
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,280
MI then that leaves us with a Punjab

1034
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,440
vs MI Qualifier Two.

1035
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,200
Or again what you said about the big game

1036
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,400
It will have MI in it. but i don't know why

1037
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,400
It feels like Punjab this season. who to

1038
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,280
Me it feels like Punjab. punjab over m

1039
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,960
I? I think if I'm beating you GT

1040
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,520
Carrying some more momentum in.

1041
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,720
Yaar de were carrying momentum into the game

1042
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,000
Against Punjab is well. The One Before the League

1043
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,760
Stage ended. Seven out of eight were victorious. So

1044
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,319
There was momentum there too. hey it's just end

1045
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,920
Because qualifier two is in Ahmedabad. A

1046
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,200
Truer batting surface, shorter straight boundaries

1047
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:34,079
Is. will it suit priyansh or it's just a feel

1048
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Punjab or Punjab to go through RCB. So

1049
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,920
It's a repeat of Qualifier One in the

1050
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,200
Final. ok and then punjab rcb final

1051
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:49,040
Tanay First Time Winner Ya Ya She

1052
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:52,960
wow for OG fan for the ya mean that remember

1053
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,520
There's that yellow and red jersey and the white and

1054
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,800
red jersey posture arsenal style jersey correct

1055
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,560
it's either correct or they have the same

1056
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,839
Sponsors where I thought Irit was the same

1057
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,680
One of these teams will win after 18 years

1058
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,280
Just because of the kind of year Virat Kohli

1059
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,400
This is the 18th season, there have been many such occasions

1060
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,400
when that person has done everything and that

1061
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,960
The trophy went away passing by the trophy

1062
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,880
just for that man rcb two

1063
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,880
just you know i feel like it's like i would

1064
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,000
Love for Punjab to win what a team what a

1065
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,240
Tournament what a story but 18 years old

1066
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,079
I went and saw that man breaking very hard

1067
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,800
He has passed by the trophy many times

1068
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,680
K went and did everything in 2016, scored 900 runs

1069
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,760
I made it but still couldn't win, just for that

1070
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,560
It feels like the year of Virat Kohli

1071
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,040
let's hope let's hope or

1072
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,359
you know people say that if Preity Zinta

1073
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,000
happy to every indian man that is also

1074
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,800
true correct every pretty fan but if virat

1075
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,720
kohli happy than also all of india so

1076
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,560
its a v preity zinta vs virat

1077
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,359
Kohli final or but Kohli or I think so

1078
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,520
Write and I think RCB fan base deserves it

1079
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,680
It's done, yes it's been a while

1080
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,839
The poor ones have heard many taunts that everything

1081
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Where is the trophy? There will be a trophy to show

1082
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,079
All in all it will be good for your play

1083
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,839
off prediction hai isara cup na or ok or

1084
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,160
And for a champion like

1085
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,000
Virat Kohli, this cannot be his legacy

1086
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,359
that he doesn't have a trophy in IPL

1087
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
give it to her do you you you you you you you think

1088
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,440
If he wins heel retires from don't say so

1089
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,000
Yaar I don't think he has years in IPL

1090
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,240
he will play for few years but there is nothing

1091
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,160
Left to win after that for Rohit Sharma too

1092
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,000
also there is nothing left to win or

1093
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,800
Actually right for Rohit Sharma then there

1094
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,119
Is ODI World Cup DI World Cup to Win

1095
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,920
There be nothing for Virat, we mean Virat

1096
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,839
will complete the trophy cabinet fully or only

1097
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,920
He has a, he has two champions trophies. only

1098
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,720
He has one T20 World Cup, he has one 50 overs

1099
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,640
World Cup, he has the taste mess. Then the world

1100
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,480
Test championship would not have been number one

1101
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,280
Of the test team. and now if he has an

1102
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,800
IPL Trophy that's it. Wow! so just for

1103
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:58,079
That dream RCB. or ok? Same pages. Is

1104
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:02,079
No? Ok. Ready Tany bhai. or is it ours

1105
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,920
Meme section. Ok. Up next. Ok. CSK

1106
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,319
This has not been discussed in this podcast.

1107
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,240
It has not happened that much. Yes sir. ah this was the season

1108
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,280
Not even that much to talk about. So what

1109
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,680
Do you feel it after seeing this? I Kind of Feel

1110
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,839
Bad for the fan base. I do as well. there some

1111
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,880
Of the most passionate fan bases man. look at

1112
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,880
That, man, is a legacy

1113
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,800
Theirs, and these make a lot of noise too, man.

1114
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,640
Look at this, this is a legacy. that's what i said

1115
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
to you

1116
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,440
that he believed that there could be a reversal from anywhere

1117
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,760
This man will give it. Hmm. And now that he's not there

1118
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,960
getting

1119
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,680
It is very sad, it is very difficult

1120
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,920
Accept this thing. we we that supasi

1121
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,920
To see that dominance slip away from your hands

1122
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,839
It is not easy to see something go away. hmm hmm

1123
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,319
But you hope they come back, I have scored a good score

1124
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:47,200
Hmm for the next season if Dhoni retires

1125
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,960
who will be the next wicketkeeper

1126
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,280
Urvil Patel is a very good wicket keeper batsman

1127
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,400
are in his team and have made him play

1128
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,160
ok so this means that confidence

1129
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,599
He has inspired me in the nets

1130
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,280
the manner in which the keeping is done

1131
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:04,480
I have batted so you know I am Abhishek Nair

1132
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,880
was asked on this show that if you had a bad

1133
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,800
auction then in the next two-three years you

1134
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,119
Can you recover? Will you recover next year?

1135
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,839
You can cover it. he said yes it is

1136
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,800
It's Possible to Go and Get the Pieces That You Are

1137
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,480
Missing. is that true? After the mega auction

1138
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,040
I mean and of course Abhishek Nair would know

1139
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,880
Better because it works with these systems.

1140
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,319
But after the mega auction it will be a bit difficult

1141
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,800
This happens because next year, the same number of

1142
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,880
Releases are not made by every team. Specially

1143
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,480
If you make it Indian then it will be Indian core only. And

1144
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
No team releases the Indian core

1145
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,720
To our good Indian players.

1146
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,400
One thing that has happened well for CSK this

1147
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,319
This is the season when the players like Urvil Patel

1148
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,560
Replacements have arrived Devolt Brevis

1149
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,480
they are here to stay good

1150
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,560
If you have done perfection then they are that big

1151
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,160
Hedex will not be in that mega auction

1152
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,920
go and because i think there are a lot of

1153
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,240
Chennai Super Kings releases are coming

1154
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,319
or things will happen at the end of this season

1155
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,920
If it happens then the purse will be much bigger than that mini one

1156
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,319
When you go to the auction, they will go for some

1157
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,560
players that they want who will come next

1158
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,240
Cameron Green will come in the year's mini auction

1159
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,319
of Australia

1160
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,040
Harry Brooke has been banned so he is

1161
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,520
It is not coming right now because it is pull only

1162
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,040
late and you don't do that because it's unfair

1163
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,280
On the teams, friend, they do all the planning

1164
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,359
We will take you, if you don't give your name

1165
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,599
or Harry Books Not Coming But Camon Green Is

1166
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,359
One player who can be watched for his end

1167
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,400
Overseas all-rounder but Cameron Green is a bit

1168
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:27,520
He is injury prone, let's see it

1169
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:30,319
surprise us 100% ok moving on o one

1170
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,680
Is venue change a hypothetical scenario?

1171
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:35,200
Now Narendra Modi Stadium will come in it

1172
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,520
It will become Ahmedabad. but wow rcb

1173
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,000
MIF FINAL WOULD BE SOMETHING. so many

1174
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,599
story lines how many friends actually and

1175
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,760
that we were talking about a while ago

1176
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:47,760
Big match experience on one hand is his DNA

1177
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,480
The DNA of winning is there to stay on that side of the line

1178
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,839
DNA of. Big Match DNA Butt on One Side

1179
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,560
Negative DNA of losing every time. Idar One

1180
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,720
vince and the other one just says ya big time

1181
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,880
Done. Now we have to win by losing again and again. it's

1182
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,160

1197
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,359

but do you think this is true do you think that

1202
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,920
Mumbai Indians reach the playoffs

1203
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:02,559
can they carry it into brother because I

1204
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:07,280
I told you that he is so used to such places

1205
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:09,760
It's such an amazing comeback DNA to come out

1206
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,359
In that team, he can be used in any situation

1207
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,760
I believe that we will win I think that

1208
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:15,839
is variant and that they have in abundance

1209
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,839

1210
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,800
speaking about sky having his

1211
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,480
greatest mumbai greatest for any better

1212
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,079
Never scored more runs than this in any season

1213
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,760
In which Mumbai Indians batsman gave

1214
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,359
The great Sachin Tendulkar made it in one season

1215
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,359
After that now Surya Kumar Yadav is my enemy

1216
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:33,160
Quietly Just Going About His Work

1217
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:36,960
suddenly are the best season just like that

1218
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:39,119
So, as far as you have understood about plays, we

1219
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,520
What matters most in the play of stage

1220
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,559
First qualify for the top two that is

1221
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,800
Very to get one more chance like I did

1222
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,720
Said this format of play-offs has been started since 2011

1223
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,720
Only one has started in these 14 years

1224
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,720
This time the team that placed third or fourth won the match.

1225
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,160
If you qualify then that tells you the

1226
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,800
Advantage of Finishing One

1227
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:01,920
Two Second Winning Those Moments

1228
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,480
in the game like when mumbai indians that game

1229
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:10,720
The team came out victorious against Delhi Capitals

1230
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:13,480
We are 132 for five at the end of 18 overs.

1231
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:17,839
In the next two overs he conceded 48 runs

1232
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,599
Make it. They went to 180. they seize the momentum

1233
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,760
in these two overs and then there was no coming back

1234
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,559
Gave it to Delhi. put delhi under so much

1235
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,800
Pressure in 12 balls. for the first 18 overs

1236
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,640
Delhi are in the game. They are ahead. so you

1237
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,880
Have to win those moments. you can't lie

1238
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,040
Go of a single moment.

1239
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,240
That matters most of the plays. Every Game

1240
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,160
in does it matter and in plays because

1241
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,720
The context is so much and the stakes are so much

1242
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,720
Is. Does it matter? but do you think 18 years in

1243
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,520
to ipl we figure more patterns about

1244
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,760
Players that have a more experience. did you learn?

1245
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,839
or or correct. The more you learn, the more you

1246
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,559
Play, the more you realize how to do it

1247
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:53,440
Is.

1248
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,000
Look at that frame, man. Too much ora. Hey

1249
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,160
Fear.

1250
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,040
Meaning if I am in the occasion it explodes like this

1251
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,119
Seeing this. Look at that Ora factory. The

1252
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,319
World's greatest all format bowler right

1253
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,160
Now. One of the Worlds Premiere

1254
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:11,760
Allrounders a murderer of all sorts of

1255
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:14,000
Bowling Surya Kumar Yadav and the Greatest

1256
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,160
One of the greatest IPL captains, White

1257
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,640
Ball Captain Rohit Sharma. behind him a

1258
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,520
Future Superstar in Tilak Varma. Brother friend

1259
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,960
Chaos. And look at that. If the core is like this. As such

1260
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,640
ho bhaiya this is this is all handpicked and

1261
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,160
Built it's not like other teams broke it

1262
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,720
Is. In football we hear that somewhere you

1263
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,559
You break this broken guy, this broken guy

1264
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,240
Not there. you can technically say hardik

1265
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,599
Pandya came back from Gujarat but made a comeback

1266
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:40,559
It was not Mumbai. we already told you playo

1267
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,480
Stop it before it happens. Otherwise, you can go straight to the trophy

1268
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:46,000
We will talk.

1269
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,559
True. It's so well on this. same i when

1270
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,720
We are ready to take revenge on the revenge, I think her

1271
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,960
Cricket fan knew this was at least a play off

1272
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,319
Team top four so guaranteed or correct so much

1273
00:51:52,960 --> 00:52:00,319
Strong Indian core dude its insane now

1274
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:04,000
Now it's a matter of OG mentality or killer

1275
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:07,359
Killer Instinct Mar Do Guys Dominate Butt

1276
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,760
This time it's going to be a little bit difficult

1277
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,760
moving on

1278
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,760
Look, this is an MI

1279
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,040
[Laughter]

1280
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,200
have seen it

1281
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,359
I have. Why don't you shut up, wherever I am taking you

1282
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,240

1283
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:29,760
Brother, this is not happening to this team just like that. Or

1284
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:32,240
Done? We are I, so am I. am i haz

1285
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,200
Winning the championship? no not this season

1286
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,839
Buddy. This season I mean they can if there is one

1287
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,839
The team that can win from fourth it is them.

1288
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,520
But it's going to be an appealing task. and you would

1289
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,599
Want a new team to do it. Hmm hmm hmm.

1290
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,119
This is an objective fan open. My

1291
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,520
This is an opinion. Of course, of course. i want

1292
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:51,680
To C Championship Number Six. Yeah, the

1293

Sixth star on the batch. Yes. Ok. Ok.

1294
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,440
loyal rohit fan also mean c may be just

1295
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,720
Maybe BB. Let them have this one. Yeah? Yeah.

1296
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,760
I am sure. I am sure. Tell me brother.

1297
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,760
Dude, as a neutral.

1298
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,400
You know no. Actually as a Kohli fan for

1299
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,559
Kohli. wouldn't mind seeing it. I don't

1300
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,680
Think anyone's mind. Right? Anyone Wood

1301
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,800
Mind? Anybody like even the most hard core

1302
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:19,440
CSK MI fans wood se yaar. I don't know

1303
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,079
What CSK fans? I think they will be well

1304
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,720
Buddy. don't give them, you should give them that much

1305
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,319
Credit. I think they are the very knowledgeable

1306
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,880
Fans don't understand cricket well. before

1307
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,480
Before Kohli leads the game. or an IPL

1308
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,400
There should be a trophy, friend. scored so many runs

1309
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,559
In IPL. He has given so much happiness. One

1310
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:40,000
He should get his happiness back. Ok.

1311
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:43,000
Mark my words if RCB come to the final

1312
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,760
will be the stadium

1313
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,960
boys nothing will give me more pleasure than two

1314
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,440
Lift the trophy with beer I mean tried for

1315
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,559
many many years

1316
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,040
I missed him a lot you know the emotional one of

1317
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,079
your teammates here he just quietly did a

1318
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,000
Fis form like that that is the RCB emotion

1319
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,720
That's what these guys and of course AP

1320
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,200
De Villiers is an amazing star of RCB

1321
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,599
But this passion is there in very few teams

1322
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,880
Is. A team that has achieved so many results

1323
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,920
What did you do, you didn't even give me a single trophy

1324
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,520
Is. But that love has not diminished. sometimes he

1325
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,559
The confidence has not diminished. ever look at him

1326
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,720
Going like this time. look at that look at

1327
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,960
That's what they did. or honestly it will

1328
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,520
Be a good visual to see Kohli along side

1329
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,960
AB de Villiers along side Chris Gayle.

1330
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,559
All three are losing the same trophy. What

1331
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,119
They are superstars, man. what a batting line up

1332
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:34,240
Was. I think Chris Gayle and AB W

1333
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,839
Made RCB cool along 100% that's why I

1334
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,920
I am saying that I built a fan base from there

1335
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,280
He always played brand cricket

1336
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,079

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,920
Happens oh what's the matter mahakum has reached

It felt like this is not work. it is not
