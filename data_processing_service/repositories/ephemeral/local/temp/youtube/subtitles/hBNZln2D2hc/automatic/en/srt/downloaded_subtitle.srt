My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,280
Welcome to Study Gloss.  What did

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,640
they say?  I have brought three news together

and all three are connected to each other.  So

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,199

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,600
So you have a good chance.  So the

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,559
first news is that Asim Munir is not coming on 14th June.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,200
14th June also passed.  Asim

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,039
Munir did not come.  America denied it.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,039
But what is happening now?  Today at 1:00.

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,719
What time is it right now while I'm giving this lecture

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,520
?  It is 11:53 in the afternoon.  So

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,399
in just one and a half hour, Asim Mur will meet

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,239
Donald Trump.  Both will meet each other

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,560
and there will be a closed door meeting.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,119
So this is a hypocritical attitude.  Well

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,119
Pakistan needs America and at this

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,840
moment America needs Pakistan.

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,200
But first of all I told you the big news.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,840
After that I will tell you that I will be

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
in Washington for five days.  He

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,119
stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington DC

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,360
and there's this CNN article.

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,759
He has said something.  So let's talk about

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,280
what it said?  He has given some speech.

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,240
Ok?  It is addressed to the people there, Pakistani

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,920
Americans.  So

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,280
it has said that we stand with Iran.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,560
Asim Munir has said that we

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,159
stand with Iran.

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,159
What kind of crazy people are you?  what are you saying

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,720
?  They themselves are not able to understand it.

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,360
Meanwhile in the Parliament his deputy PM

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,200
Ishqdar is saying that no brother, we have nothing to

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,159
do with it.  We will not help

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,079
Iran.  He straight away withdrew his hand, in fact he had

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
given assurance to Iran and that is why the

47
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,920
IRGC member said that Pakistan

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,560
will help us and may

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,400
even give us nuclear missiles.  Shaheen 2700 Km.   The

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,640
range which was denied.  Now he is

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,200
saying in Washington to please the people

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,239
that we stand with Iran

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,879
and the conflict with Israel will

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,000
end very soon.  Is it okay

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,360
?  Now, there was the speech of Pakistani

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,840
politician Abdul Razzaq Raza and

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,920
what did he say?  When he finished his speech,

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,440

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,840
he said victory over India, victory over India.  Ok.  Now

60
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,599
all the Pakistanis present there joined in with

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,080
great enthusiasm.  Yes, you have said it very well.  You have

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,280
said a very good thing.  After that

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,640
it says that in the era of 1979 when the entire

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,160
system of life of

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
India was

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,879
under the control of Pakistan.  Then

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,640
he said that very weak diplomacy has been done.

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,360
India has defeated us by deceit

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,120
and by deceit it has taken the whole world with

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,000
itself.

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,319
He has spoken such things and he has said that

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,640
our political and military leadership is

73
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,360
one body and one soul.  You just saw it now.

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,680
So these things have been said and we have had the support of China also.  He

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
said this yesterday on

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,959
Tuesday.  He gave a speech yesterday.  Is it okay

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,200
?  And spewed venom against India.  Now

78
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
Asim Munir, you know that he

79
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,640
is a defeated general.  Therefore the third news becomes important.

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,959
Pakistanis are standing outside his hotel.

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,280

82
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,480
See, every Pakistani knows inside

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,400
who is right and who is wrong.  Leaders of Tehreek Insaaf

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,879
party have

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,959
raised slogans against him that the murderer of Islamabad is

86
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:52,080
coward Asim Munir, such slogans were raised.  Is it

87
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,400
okay?  That he is the killer of Islamabad.

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,319
This is a coward.  He doesn't know anything.

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,640
All this has been said to Asim Munir.  And there were many

90
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,519
people who raised these slogans.  There were

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,280
not even one or two outside his hotel.  A whole group had come.

92
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
 

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,480
Apart from all this, his meeting with Donald Trump is

94
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,200
very interesting.

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,440
Because see, Donald Trump had said this,

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
Donald Trump of America had said

97
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,680
that we did not invite him to the Army Day which was to be held on June 14.

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
Then I

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,960
invited him for lunch.  This will last for 5 days now.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,360
Now you know that Pakistan has

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
closed its land routes with Iran.

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
Those 10,000 Indians

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,800
could have easily come from Pakistan but Pakistan

104
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,600
stopped them, which has always been its

105
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,040
record.  So there might be food shortage in Buchistan as well

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
because a lot of food and

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,759
water used to come from here.  The Gab Riman border

108
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,320
in Gwadar has been closed and the

109
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,960
Taftan border in Chagi District has been

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,919
closed.  Is it okay?  So now it is

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,400
obvious that Iran and Israel are at war

112
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,560
and now just count the days when America will also jump into the war.

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,160
Iran has prepared to

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,880
attack America's bases and

115
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,520
America too will attack any moment now.

116
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,479
Ok?  For that, Pakistan's

117
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,000
help will be needed under all circumstances.  Ok?  But

118
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,400
Pakistan is stuck here.  If he

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,080
helps America, he will

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,720
come into the notice of the entire Islamic world and

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,720
India can gain a lot from this.  But

122
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,800
Pakistan is Pakistan, it needs

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,960
money.  Ok?  Everybody has been sold in some way or the other.

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,440
So he stands with America.

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,039
Whatever they are saying, we are

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,960
with Iran.  I am with these people, I am with those people.  If you

127
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,280
are with Iran then please help.  Send your

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,520
soldiers but did not send them.  Didn't send anything.  On the contrary,

129
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,360
they have entered America.

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,080
Staying in a nice five star hotel.  We will have a

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
nice dinner and drink alcohol.  All of them

132
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
drink a lot of alcohol.

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,320
Their leaders are fond of alcohol.  Forget that.  That is

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,360
just to show this and that of Islam.

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,000
All the rest are drug addicts.  Is it okay

136
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,840
?  Then we will go with ease.  They will

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,680
drink lots of alcohol and will have a meeting with Donald Trump

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,560
and Donald Trump will tell them

139
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
that they will have to help us no matter what

140
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
happens.  And this is the first official visit to

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,479
America and just now PM Modi

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,360
spoke to Donald Trump and told him that you have

143
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,600
no role in the mediation.  And now

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
America will ask for help from Asim Munir.

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,479
What is help for, though?  It is

146
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
possible that America may enter into more secret agreements

147
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,039
that we have your Noor Khan base and

148
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
we need more bases.

149
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,400
Needed for refueling because you share border with Iran.

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Pakistan is located at a

151
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,639
strategic location from where the US

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,199

153
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,520

154
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,120
can keep an eye on many countries, from Afghanistan to China to Iran to Central Asia.  So it

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,440
is obvious that this demand will be made from Pakistan

156
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
and in return, Pakistan will get a

157
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
crypto deal as well.  Well

158
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
crypto will also ruin Pakistan.

159
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,120
Crypto will ruin Pakistan.

160
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,600
Nobody knows brother, there is

161
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,080
an energy crisis in Pakistan right now and there

162
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,400
seems to be a huge energy crisis for crypto.  You will

163
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,199
not give all your energy to the public.

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,199
Who will you give electricity to after cutting off public's electricity?

165
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
To crypto miners and those crypto miners have

166
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,840
a lot of tokens in it first because

167
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,319
mining is not easy.  The

168
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,000
computer keeps running for five to six days.  Most of

169
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,479
your electricity is coming from China.  Then it will

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,639
become a very big problem.  Pakistan will be trapped.  There will be a

171
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
huge energy crisis there

172
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,240
if we go to crypto.  But

173
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
because they have to do that deal also.  We

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
are Don Trump Businessmen.  So that is why Asim Munir has

175
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,319
gone there.  Help will be sought from Iran.

176
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,840
Pakistan's air bases will be requisitioned.

177
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,759
In return, Pakistan may be

178
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
