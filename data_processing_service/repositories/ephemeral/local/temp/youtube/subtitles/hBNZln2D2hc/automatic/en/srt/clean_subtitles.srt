I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  What did they say?  I have brought three news together and all three are connected to each other.

America denied it. But what is happening now?  Today at 1:00. What time is it right now while I'm giving this lecture ?  It is 11:53 in the afternoon.  So in just one and a half hour, Asim Mur will meet Donald Trump.  Both will meet each other and there will be a closed door meeting. So this is a hypocritical attitude.  Well Pakistan needs America and at this moment America needs Pakistan. But first of all I told you the big news. After that I will tell you that I will be in Washington for five days.  He stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington DC and there's this CNN article. He has said something.  So let's talk about what it said?  He has given some speech. Ok?  It is addressed to the people there, Pakistani Americans.  So it has said that we stand with Iran. Asim Munir has said that we stand with Iran. What kind of crazy people are you?  what are you saying ?  They themselves are not able to understand it. Meanwhile in the Parliament his deputy PM Ishqdar is saying that no brother, we have nothing to do with it.  We will not help Iran.  He straight away withdrew his hand, in fact he had given assurance to Iran and that is why the IRGC member said that Pakistan will help us and may even give us nuclear missiles.  Shaheen 2700 Km.   The range which was denied.  Now he is saying in Washington to please the people that we stand with Iran and the conflict with Israel will end very soon.  Is it okay ?  Now, there was the speech of Pakistani politician Abdul Razzaq Raza and what did he say?  When he finished his speech, he said victory over India, victory over India.  Ok.  Now all the Pakistanis present there joined in with great enthusiasm.  Yes, you have said it very well.  You have said a very good thing.  After that it says that in the era of 1979 when the entire system of life of India was under the control of Pakistan.  Then he said that very weak diplomacy has been done. India has defeated us by deceit and by deceit it has taken the whole world with itself. He has spoken such things and he has said that our political and military leadership is one body and one soul.  You just saw it now. So these things have been said and we have had the support of China also.  He said this yesterday on Tuesday.  He gave a speech yesterday.  Is it okay ?  And spewed venom against India.  Now Asim Munir, you know that he is a defeated general.  Therefore the third news becomes important. Pakistanis are standing outside his hotel. See, every Pakistani knows inside who is right and who is wrong.  Leaders of Tehreek Insaaf party have raised slogans against him that the murderer of Islamabad is coward Asim Munir, such slogans were raised.  Is it okay?  That he is the killer of Islamabad. This is a coward.  He doesn't know anything. All this has been said to Asim Munir.  And there were many people who raised these slogans.  There were not even one or two outside his hotel.  A whole group had come. Apart from all this, his meeting with Donald Trump is very interesting. Because see, Donald Trump had said this, Donald Trump of America had said that we did not invite him to the Army Day which was to be held on June 14. Then I invited him for lunch.  This will last for 5 days now. Now you know that Pakistan has closed its land routes with Iran. Those 10,000 Indians could have easily come from Pakistan but Pakistan stopped them, which has always been its record.  So there might be food shortage in Buchistan as well because a lot of food and water used to come from here.  The Gab Riman border in Gwadar has been closed and the Taftan border in Chagi District has been closed.  Is it okay?  So now it is obvious that Iran and Israel are at war and now just count the days when America will also jump into the war. Iran has prepared to attack America's bases and America too will attack any moment now. Ok?  For that, Pakistan's help will be needed under all circumstances.  Ok?  But Pakistan is stuck here.  If he helps America, he will come into the notice of the entire Islamic world and India can gain a lot from this.  But Pakistan is Pakistan, it needs money.  Ok?  Everybody has been sold in some way or the other. So he stands with America. Whatever they are saying, we are with Iran.  I am with these people, I am with those people.  If you are with Iran then please help.  Send your soldiers but did not send them.  Didn't send anything.  On the contrary, they have entered America. Staying in a nice five star hotel.  We will have a nice dinner and drink alcohol.  All of them drink a lot of alcohol. Their leaders are fond of alcohol.  Forget that.  That is just to show this and that of Islam. All the rest are drug addicts.  Is it okay ?  Then we will go with ease.  They will drink lots of alcohol and will have a meeting with Donald Trump and Donald Trump will tell them that they will have to help us no matter what happens.  And this is the first official visit to America and just now PM Modi spoke to Donald Trump and told him that you have no role in the mediation.  And now America will ask for help from Asim Munir. What is help for, though?  It is possible that America may enter into more secret agreements that we have your Noor Khan base and we need more bases. Needed for refueling because you share border with Iran. Pakistan is located at a strategic location from where the US can keep an eye on many countries, from Afghanistan to China to Iran to Central Asia.  So it is obvious that this demand will be made from Pakistan and in return, Pakistan will get a crypto deal as well.  Well crypto will also ruin Pakistan. Crypto will ruin Pakistan. Nobody knows brother, there is an energy crisis in Pakistan right now and there seems to be a huge energy crisis for crypto.  You will not give all your energy to the public. Who will you give electricity to after cutting off public's electricity? To crypto miners and those crypto miners have a lot of tokens in it first because mining is not easy.  The computer keeps running for five to six days.  Most of your electricity is coming from China.  Then it will become a very big problem.  Pakistan will be trapped.  There will be a huge energy crisis there if we go to crypto.  But because they have to do that deal also.  We are Don Trump Businessmen.  So that is why Asim Munir has gone there.  Help will be sought from Iran. Pakistan's air bases will be requisitioned. In return, Pakistan may be given money and crypto deals which Donald Trump has already given. Now the meeting will be held behind closed doors.   That means no one will be told.  So something might be wrong.  India is keeping an eye on this. What do you think?  You must tell me in the comment box.  Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddharth Agnihotri signing off.
