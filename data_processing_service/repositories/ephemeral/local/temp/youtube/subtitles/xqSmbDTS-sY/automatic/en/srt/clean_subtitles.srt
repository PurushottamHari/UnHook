Our goods trains they move at a speed that is slower than an activa whereas in China it's three times faster. China is a very different country. China plans for 100 years. But how do they do that? India 1 consumes maybe 100,000 items in their lifetime. India 2 consumes 10,000 items in their lifetime. India 3 consumes not more than thousand items in their lifetime. We were responsible to reduce the savings of this country in a way. For someone who is one of India's biggest retailers, he's also one of our most unassuming billionaires. Kishar Bani, we are going to be a $1 trillion economy in terms of consumption. How was Big Bazar born as an idea? How did you spot that opportunity? In hindsight, I think we were very early play and we couldn't have gone wrong. Big Bazar, part of the future group is pioneered the modern trade revolution in India. I prefer to go on Wednesday. Why? because lot of discount is available. Did you expand pantaloons using a franchise model? No, never. Why not? So I personally don't believe in franchising model unless it's a I did this research uh 3 4 years ago. The average lifespan of organization came down to 18 years. 18 years. If I do the research now, I think it will come down to less than like But aren't balls a more convenient strategy? when covid came in we were the first who were impacted the most because 65% of our business were in malls correct and then the society I think the habits a lot of things changed so we had no other option but to sell out fight life became very different what what exactly was that fight all about sir because it never we never really understood what exactly was it about uh [Music] [Music] We before we move on, I would like to thank ODO for supporting our content.

India is an interesting country which is learning to consume, which is learning to have aspirations, which is following the media, social media trends of the world. And we are uniquely designed. We are a country of six major religion, 6,000 cast and subcasts, 29 states and 19 nearly 18 to 19% of the world's population. We will definitely make an impact if we consume more or if we participate in the economy to the world economy in a way. So India has to grow. How much it will grow, how will it grow will depend on many many factors according to me. But uh it's time for India in a way but that's been the time for a long long time. Our population demographics, our infrastructure, I think India has done very well on building infrastructure which allows the growth to happen. I think we have built airports, we have built good roads, we have built good ports from where we were, I think we have done a very decent job in building infrastructure. So if you do a benchmarking from where we were, we've definitely done a good job. Fantastic. But then I was just studying India's logistics and we have a broken logistic system. Yeah, but it's not it's improving. Let's our logistic cost uh is more than 11%. It should come down to 7% of your GDP. Correct. So how is that going to come down? It logistic and supply chain is a very complex subject just because we whenever we build an industry we have to build the entire ecosystem for this industry. We were not designed that way and I think the way China is designed wherein they have built cities of a particular product they have built infrastructure supply chain I think it's taking time up government has taken some uh move on that in terms of uh building a a city for a category kind of product we need to do a lot to get into that kind of supply chain that kind of efficiency that kind of logistic cost but India has built highways India has built infrastructure Now it's for us to I think it's all about entrepreneurship. How entrepreneurs new entrepreneurs will come in and develop this country. But sir, how are we going to do that? Because I was studying some stat to understand the progress of India in terms of logistics. Our goods train they move at a speed of 25 km/ hour on an average. I think if you look at it, we are the only country which is delivering in 10 minutes products at people's home. But that is also logistics. But that is last mile. No sir. But that is also logistics. Yeah, that is logistics. India will s India will always surprise you in doing some things in a great manner and something not in so great manner. I think we have we have to fix a lot of things. Lot of things have to come together. But quick commerce this is still restricted to only the India one. I'm not talking about I think India will see beauty of India happening somewhere and not so good things happening somewhere. So a lot of things have to come together to get everything right. M but logistics definitely has to come together. Lot of things have to come together. M but our goods trains they move at a speed that is slower than an activa whereas in China it's three times faster. China China is a very different country. China plans for 100 years. China has destroyed its past. China 20 years ago took a lot of decisions around how education, how gaming, how investment banking and they they kind of reimagined the country in a very different way. They went on to produce 85,000 designers, two and a half leg engineers every year with high quality. They moved into designled uh businesses went into deep tech. They laid that foundation of building a new economy long time back. But how do they do that? I think destroying the past. Can you give me can you walk me through that? China doesn't have a religion per se as such. They don't live in the past. Uh so we uh Indians we love to live in the past. What do you mean by that and how does it shape India's growth story? I think past is our belief systems culturally, society, religion wise and I think our society has been designed to be happy or be contained. it India is a age-old civilization and our past continues in form of mythology, in form of stories, in form of uh whatever we do. I think our parents want to teach us uh what they believe was right and we want to teach our children and maybe our children will continue to tell the same stories. These stories are not about growth. These stories were not about entrepreneurship. These stories were about uh I think uh I think our methodology and how do you think that hampers India's economic growth story I think we need new stories we need new stories of entrepreneurship we need new stories of growth we need new stories of development new podcast basically podcast are definitely a way I believe uh when I discovered podcast I believe it was like reading a book because all our life we learned out of reading books and Now podcast is like uh reading a book very very imaginatively and much much more faster I would say and maybe sometimes it's quite deep also. Sir earlier I I was a very emotional optimist. I do not think logically. Now I am a logical optimist because I try to understand the constraints and strengths of India and like I said our logistics is moving slower than an active hour. We have the biggest problem of all which is land acquisition. So if you look at Bhat Mala, we started with a budget of 5.35 lakh crores and now it is more than 10 lakh crores. I have a I have a view on that. India is 18 to 19% of the world population and our land mass is 3%. So we'll always be short. Short of what? Of of the of the land and we have to design in a very different way. I don't know what that design is. When you are a land mass of only 3% of the planet, you have to design it differently. Which means we don't have the land mass of what China has. You can't design what China did. But we can definitely build highways. No sir. But we have built decent highways. Not that we have not built. But is that decent good enough? I think it's a very good beginning. It's a very good beginning. You cannot compare to China. China is again 20% of the world's population. But the land mass is much bigger. But sir, how does land mass translate to growth? Because if you look at India, no, we'll be always be in short supply of land. There always will be issues around land but we have a land acquisition problem fundamentally it will be issues around land whatever that issues are but in in in China because the state owns everything they can just ask you to move and build a road over there I think that's a very romantic way of storytelling they are all movie storytelling type things but uh I think we unique India has unique issues and we'll have to find unique solutions okay I think India was earlier a very trustbased society correct And we are lo we have lost that. And because we that hampers business that hampers growth. Okay. So sir what is our way forward? Let's tell better stories. But how are we going to shape India's growth story? I think we have a trust deficit everywhere. The government has to trust its citizens. Parents have to trust their children. The society will have to trust its members. All communities have to create heroes. We have to I think trust plays a very important role in development of any society. Okay. And how do you see India's consumer market going? Because if you study India and in fact you are the one who actually gifted this terminology to the entire entrepreneurship community, entrepreneur community where you segregated India into three categories. So first le I want to hear it from you only. How would you segregate India when it comes to consumers and how do you think entrepreneurs are supposed to use that data to then build their business? I think uh we wrote long time back maybe 18 20 years ago that India from consumption lens can be seen into three Indas that is India 1, India 2, India 3. I still hold that theory now also. Okay. India one is a consuming class. Anybody who doesn't do some things at home with his own hand is India one which is he has some domestic help. India two is a people who serve India one to lead a better life. India 3 is the one who is the struggling class the farm laborers the daily wage earners. So everyone every uh India consumes differently. India one I call them as a consuming class. So we went much deeper into India 1 now and we said India 1 has uh around maybe what we call it's around 10% of India 30 million households 30 million households 12 cr people out of which we broke down this 12 cr people into 50 to 60 lakh people which accounts for 15% of our GDP is exactly like Singapore around 50 lakh people per capita of Singapore kind of uh uh very similar to Singapore and 15% of India's GDP. Then we came down, we saw another 3 three and a half cr people exactly like Poland. They also account for 15% of India's GDP and then came in another 8 and 1/2 cr people exactly like Mexico and uh they accounted for 15% of India's GDP. If you look at this top 30 million households, they account for India's 45% of GDP. They account for 70% of package goods consumption. They account for 89% of beauty products. They account for 50% of the clothing market. Significant amount of entertainment going about uh services. This 10 top 10% accounts for nearly 50% of India's consumption. So here's where India's consumer story is. I think the consumption uh story ends here because the rest of India consumes nonvalue added products. What do you mean by that sir? I think value addition which they do at home or they consume very number of SKUs which they consume are very very low. So the numbers are huge but the value addition is lower. Value addition means you have added some processing you brand packaging design there is something extra which has gone into it and there is lot of economic activity which happens for India to grow we have to get into a value added economy. So would a good analogy be purchasing rice and purchasing biryani? I think the per kilo the rice cost 40 rupees. The biryani delivered at home through a zomato will cost you close to 280 rupees to 450 rupees a kilo. So biryani value addition because there is a delivery cost, there is a packaging cost, there is a processing cost and then there is the branding and the marketing cost. So in that value addition lot of people have entered in and lot of earnings have happened. So the the story of 40 rupees to 280 rupees is a seven times value addition. Correct. So as far as my podcast are concerned, fortunately or unfortunately I've been only I've been exposed to only people who have built businesses for India 1. So India 1 is more or less clear to me and we'll seek a deeper understanding of how to build for India 1 and then go towards India 2 and India 3 throughout this entire episode. And then I want to come to the story of big bazar and apply all these learnings and frameworks to the story of big bazar to then understand the rise and fall so that we can take out lessons in such a way that today when somebody's trying to build a consumer brand in India they can use these frameworks to then approach the market. So what is the secret to cracking India 1's market sour how do you crack India one? If if today somebody were to build a consumer brand, how should they go from finding a gap in the market to all the way taking the product to the market and scaling up? I think India one there are two segment of India. One which is Singapore and Poland. They have high discretionary income. They are nearly I would say 3 and a half to 4 cr of population. They reside I would say in many corners of India and they have enough money to consume. Now it's for a marketeer or a brand developer or a product or a category creator to see what are the gaps what are the gap you can forcibly create into the minds or the neuro imaging of that people the consumers and they are willing to change they are willing to experiment sir what is the consumer behavior difference between the Singapore consumers Poland consumers and Mexico consumers a lot can you point out some differentiators. If you look at the consumption of Mexico, they are they have a problem of paying emis or some loans which Singapore and Poland doesn't have. Can you expand on that sir? So I would say Mexico consumer would have a house loan or a car loan or some EMIs to pay. So his consumption his aspirations arise equal to a Poland aspiration but uh his ability to get into that fold of consumption on a regular basis is still restricted. So you can sell the Mexican consumers a house, a car and insurance plus lot of categories they consume. Which are the top three four categories that you think we can sell to Mexico? Clothing, beauty, home delivery, food. Yeah mother I think they are they are experimentative and they are learning to consume everything. Got it. But would clothing still be restricted to brands like but then the price point changes there. Yeah. So would you call them would would you say that Mexico if you were to understand them in the context of the clothing market. Do you think they would restrict themselves only to Zudo and Westside and not go beyond? They might experiment with many brands. I think Zudo is also a very interesting thing because today Mexico is a very instadriven society. Once you see a particular clothes with a particular image of yours which you have posted, you want to see you want you don't want to post that again on another day. So the frequency of changing for that customer so the price point changes because if you have to change so fast you can't afford to pay more and I think zodia fulfilled that need. So wherever their needs will get fulfilled they are going to go there. Got it. Now let's move to Poland. What is the stark differentiation between Mexico and Poland consumers? I think they're comfortable in finance. They are comfortable in basic uh housing, clothing, shelter, I think business. They have created wealth for one or two generations. So they are much much more secured. And how does that result into a behavioral shift? The decision making shift because they are much much more secured. They don't have loans to pay and uh I think they behave very differently. They are they are they have a discretionary income. They are experimenting with a lot of new categories. They are going abroad. They are shopping there. It's very very different. Got it. And if an entrepreneur has to sell to Mexico versus they selling to Poland, how do you think their approach should change? I think Mexico the number the audience is a little larger. They will be very very value and price conscious and uh they are still aspirational and they want to be part of the mainstream of the society and uh they are as modern consumers of content as what Poland would be and uh they are wanting to be part of everything new happening in the society culturally or anything else. Got it. So if an entrepreneur has to sell to Mexico, the entrepreneur will have to assume that they are aspirational but they are price conscious. But when they sell to a Mexico, they can just merely focus on perceived value. I would say Mexico is price conscious, not Poland people. Oh, sorry. Mexico is price conscious and Poland is not price and value conscious. Both Poland is not so conscious. They are conscious but not so conscious as much as what Mexico is. Got it. So if I were to understand this in the context of the clothing brands because that's something that everybody can use as a head stick, Mexico would be Zudo, Poland would be Zara and Singapore Westside also. Okay. And Singapore would be Singapore is is very different. It is quite luxury or it's premium and luxury brand. And if you name just to give you a perspective, there is a Hermes store in Kalagura. MS is the biggest luxury brand of the world. When I took some data from there, 60 people 60 Bombay people or Indian people account for 80% of their business and it it is among the few top ranking stores of Hermes. So just to give you just to give the audience more context, how much does an Hermes bag cost? I would say nothing less than five lakhs. Nothing as a starting point. Okay. And there they are able to sell to 60 customers. 60 customers account for close to 80% of the business. So do they get repeat sales? Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. But Singapore is very different that audience there. That is that 50 lakh people. You can name them. Got it. Get them into your podcast also. You're one of them sir. I'm not there. You are one of them sir. So I would place you even above Singapore. You are probably I'm not there. Maybe I have not been able to shop from her yet. Anyway, that is because you do not want to. Anyway, I don't think so. Anyway, that's a separate story. Okay, sir. Now, help me understand what should be an entrepreneur's approach to selling to Singapore because here you have very high disposable income. I think people are uh people are there also the community is bored of all this uh premium and luxury brands. They want quiet luxury now. Quiet luxury. Luxury which is not visible. Luxury which pleases themselves. So long story short, we have to do value addition in order to sell to India 1. Whether that's Mexico, Poland or Singapore, it doesn't matter. Now sir, how do you go about doing this value addition? Can you break this down? Value addition, what I mean by value addition is when you look at the raw material and the source raw material price to the finished product, there's a multiple X difference. So there's an opportunity for everybody to play in that. Whether it's the processing, whether it's the branding, whether it's the packaging, whether it's the design. So too many players get involved and value addition creates economies. If you look at the most advanced economies of the world, there would be lot of value added economy. If you look at China now, China is moving into value addition in a very significant way. So ultimately just to give you a perspective biscuits would start from 120 rupees a kilo to 500 rupees a kilo. But once you move to cookies and uh international biscuits we will move from 400 rupees a kilo to 2,000 a kilo. Chocolate starts from let's say barasur a kilo. But the price of raw material in India or anywhere in the world won't be more than 80 90 rupees. I would say in India at least in Indian context raw material use but it's the value addition is what uh gets the economy driven in a way the value addition in a economy is something which I think Indians are now getting there and value added products can be consumed by India one significantly correct and where do you think the biggest opportunity lies in this value addiction chain sir I think food lifestyle goods M recreation, sports, entertainment. So now let's move to India 2. Can you define India 2 first? India 2 is basically a kind of a service economy which is helping India one to lead a better life and what would their per capita income be? I don't I think it's it depends on the family size and how many members of the family working. What we are seeing is a significant change from when we started this theory to now that the India to next generation is wanting to come into the mainstream and are more aspirational and don't want to do what their parents do. So India too I will call the people who make our life better. The driver, the helper, the pune, the maids, the domestic help, watchmen, pune, lift men. So it's a it's a huge community. the the doies mother. It's a community which makes our life better and it's significant amount of India. Would you place them between $3,000 to $5,000 of per capita income? I I think depends in urban centers it'll be different in other centers it'll be different and depending on the again at the family size if the member of uh the parents both are working and the children is working children may be a part of the gig economy in a way. Now so we are seeing change of consumption pattern there also. Got it. And what exactly makes them buy? You said aspiration but then we placed zudo for Mexico. So either we we are seeing zudo or even attracting India too. India too. India to next generation. Okay. So what is the playbook to cracking India too? I think urban centers India 2 you can easily capture because they have similar aspirations because they are serving India one and they are seeing that lifestyle. So they want to ape that lifestyle. We I see a lot of beauty products happening. If you look at uh the story of uh purple also there are some brands which are catering to India to audience. I would say demart has been created with India to audience significantly. So there are brands which has been working. They are very value seekers. They are not value added consumers. They consume commodities more than I would say processed food. And uh they are experimenting with uh lot of things which are happening in terms of consumption. Got it. And three of the biggest consumption trends that you would place for India too would beauty is one. I'm very uh beauty and some lifestyle goods at lower price points. uh for example lifestyle goods are uh I would say they are also taking holidays now recreation they are their entertainment content consumption is different they don't pay so much of money to that so they will consume a lot of free content in a way and uh I would and clothing also I think they are now getting into much much more modern style clothing these are the trends Got it. Now sir, how do you sell to India 3? Because I've often heard about this term called finding fortune at the bottom of the pyramid. I think that's a I think that's a story which caught attention but it has no meaning in terms of commerce. I'm I'm not a great believer of that story at all because India 3 I just to give you a perspective India 1 consumes maybe 100,000 items in their lifetime. India too consumes maybe now they are consuming much more but earlier when we were looking at this theory it was 10,000 items in their lifetime in their lifetime means one item one pencil eraser item India 3 consumes not more than thousand items in their lifetime they are very basic consumers can any large brand be built for India 3 you can build a a Hawai chapel kind of a brand like relaxo I wouldn't know the I doubt whether they'll buy Rexo also all of them. So they are quite a lot into the re processed reusable market plus low price point. They consume commodities. They are fed by the government to a certain extent. It's a different consumer. So you don't think any large brand can be built for India 3? I can't build it or I can't imagine but there might be some products there are there are some clothing brands which are fabricdriven. consumption value added but that is that time of the year where they gift a little bit and weddings is a where their consumption happen they would buy gold at that time they might buy clothing at that time so you're saying that only once in a lifetime consumption during weddings events religious basis But otherwise it's a very basic conception. M got it understood sir. So now let's come to your story. Now that we've defined India very well. I want to understand what is your story. How did you go from being an ordinary person to becoming one of the most celebrated entrepreneurs in the country? Because I've been reading your growth story. You started from pantaloons then moved to big bazar and then you did a bunch of things. In fact, when my team started doing research about your achievements and your benchmarks, sir, we got 60 pages of research. So, we realized that it's just better to learn it from you rather than going deep into it because you'll be able to throw light on the most important checkpoints and benchmarks and achievements that you have um you have gained over time. So, I want to understand how did Kishor Byani become Kishor Byani. Let's start with one profound memory of your childhood which shaped you into the person you are because we believe in fact from all the podcasts we've done we've realized that every person is actually shaped by some profound childhood memories which turns them into the person that they are. So what made Kishor Byani the person that he is today? I I I remember two memories which may might have helped me in shaping in the consumption story which I participated. One was outside Malachmi temple there are a lot of uh stalls which comes about selling toys and other things. So as a market or a heart I have when I look at it there are memories around that and there is a memory around there was a departmental store called century bazar at uh prabadevi I've been there once or twice. So I think maybe there are some memories of that store. Maybe that would have shaped or that would have maybe whenever I'm imagining something in consumption that might be at my some vivid memory on that. Yeah. Some some visualization around that. Yeah. Sir, we were listening to your we were actually studying your story and we learned that you actually went completely bullish on denim jeans. So how did you start? How did you become an entrepreneur in the first place? So my uh family was in clothing business and they were traders of textiles and uh I think I have memories of being to the Ghi or to the Mulji Jetta market where we had a shop and dealing with fabric. I did a course in weaving also in Sasmir. In weaving. Yeah. Okay. uh my first business was to put up a weaving unit and a brand for supplying to the garment industry fabrics. Then I became the soul selling distributor for denim when mill started denim in India. So I got exposed to the readymade industry. Then I thought uh seeing the readym made industry I said there's a gap of nobody has a trouser brand in the country. So that's why panthaloons came about as a trouser brand. I put up a factory to make trousers. And parallelly I started a yarn business to make some what do you call innovative yarns to make good fabrics which is differentiated. So my career started from there. So some manufacturing some branding some dealing with the clothing industry to understand how India should we are a product of liberalization and there were many many things happening at that point of time. I think this would be around '90s, early '90s. And I think '90s gave you a lot of opportunity because India was in a liberalization mode. A lot of new things were happening. We were getting exposed to marketing, advertising. That subject fascinated me. I was a student of advertising in a way. Used to observe every ads, every brand being made and that made me interested. So that's I think was my early imagination of business. Sir, I have one request. You just putting out things so casually. You just said but sir that's a big deal like tell me deeper into you know ignorance was a bless. Okay. What do you mean we didn't go to a management school in a way I got exposed to I did my commerce I did a little bit of postgraduation I did sashmir I did my chartered accountancy I was a generalist I didn't want to be a specialist in anything. Okay. I think maybe 11th I had not moved out of a particular locality. It was experimentative life. Life was all about meeting people, learning every day. Did you always want to do a business? I was very rebellious. I would say why? I don't know why because I didn't believe maybe I was using rationality too much. I wanted to question everything which was happening at that point of time whether it was some religious rituals or why do people do a particular thing. So questioning ability to that's a problem in a way and that's a blessing also in a way. Okay. So how did you spot the first gap in the market when you actually set up a factory to manufacture trousers and you built a brand and and then you built a brand around it? How did you spot that gap and how did you put a finger to it and say I'm going to go bullish on this? So when I went uh when I was uh when I made my fabric uh when I first looms fabric to I used to make innovative fabric and consumption garment indry I got exposed to government industry then denim as a fabric to supply to all that that is again bottom I again got exposed to dealing with whatever is happening in the market and market I thought why will people not wear readymade in the long term basis I started a brand called pantaloon at that point of time. Yeah. So pantaloon was born as an idea to organize the unorganized market of denims and trousers. That time it was more trousers and not denim as much. Denim k we started a brand called bear. Bear bear became a big brand. What is the difference between 1980s and 1990s? I think I don't remember much of 80s because that was uh the very early days of learning I would say '90s was the age where we started executing and lot of experimentation we did okay for example I think 80s may we started uh I must have started a yarn business making yarns I had a fabric business making fabrics for the government industry I must have went into distribution of denim fabric to the government industry I think '90s may I moved into my own brands which is panthaloon bear John Miller then opening our own stores called pentaloon shop then the large store panthaloons in gyat which is a family store then into multiple things which is I would say more formats on retail called central brand factory big bajar hometown ezone then moved into the consumption we thought uh we should get into the consumption of Indian consumers we went into gyms salons loans a lot of joint ventures which we did we went into then we thought we should finance them to make them show up more. So we opened our NBFC we created our own uh funds also we had a private equity fund a real estate fund then we had uh we we acquired lot of businesses through that. Then we did insurance as a business. We opened our own logistic company uh which was one of the larger ones very modern. So it it's it was an eventful journey of doing multiple things too early too fast and compounding growth which was crazy. But sir, how did you dabble into so many things? I think logistics we had to do on our own and maybe we were ideas person. We thought ideas we can fractify 0 to1. I think we did so many projects 0 to1 which is when I look back it looks so stupid and so many and so much that sometimes it surprises us how much we did. Do you think you spread yourself too thin? These are all management words. Uh in hindsight one can say that because uh you should have a great cash flow business to experiment a lot. Maybe we didn't have that and we were growing on debt more. So in hindsight yes but whatever we created were good products, interesting business models. In hindsight again I say that we could have optimized everything to a level which should have been very very interesting for anyone. If you were to go back in time how do you think you would have done things differently? I would have been I would have hired somebody who could have been a great optimizer of whatever I'm creating as in for every vertical. Every vertical. So back then did you head all verticals? Not head. We had CEOs running it but optimizing is a very specialized thing. How to take out juice out of everything which you have created. Can you walk me deeper into it? So like if you look at Big Badar as a business model, it was a 26% gross margin model. If you look at the other retailers, they are at 18 19%. So we were maybe 50% more than anybody else. And how do you optimize and make money out of that? The margins were there. Central as a business model was probably the best business model which we created. It uh some of the storage abitas were in excess of 20 to 25%. But how did you have such high margins? We because we built our own products, our own brands. We had scale and we unders I think we introduced a lot of new categories in the market. Okay. So let's go from pantaloons to central to big bizarre. So pantaloons was a trouser. Pantaloon was a trouser brand. No, pantaloon was trouser and men's wear to start with a very early days small shops but then we moved into the large format of retail. So it was a multibrand outlet. It was a multibrand family outlet always right from the beginning. Yeah. Okay. Then from pantaloons what exactly were the learnings that you acquired which then helped you to level up? I think understanding the clothing business for every age group of the family. But how did you how did you understand clothing? Because today we have access to a lot of data but back then I think we were I was a fabric person. I understood yarn and I understood uh what kind of garment I went into garment manufacturing myself. we were in that value chain which I went through that journey. So to understand that was quite okay and then we had to understand the consumers and the changing behavior and the changing society in that sense. We started understanding that we started understand how to build brands, how to create uh a brand persona and how to attract consumers. I think we started learning that and that gave us that confidence that uh you can build and service people and build a business. So walk me through how to build a brand. Let's take let's understand your approach and then apply this to the modern context. How did you fundamentally build a brand? What are the I think brand is brand is uh the personality of a product which you can make somebody aspire to have or some features or some it has to reflect your persona also in a certain way so that you get attracted to it. So how do you understand your target market? How you understand that persona? How do you build that into that brand and how do you appeal to the people so that the ultimately a commerce happens. So brand persona has to resonate with customer persona which eventually results into resonance. Absolutely. And that builds a brand. Totally. Walk me through how should a brand understand their persona and then strike resonance with a customer. I think if you look at any brand it will talk about it. Take any brand and I can explain you. Let's talk about Levis. Yeah. So Levis is a brand which was built on a heritage of why denim jeans were worn by miners. how they created that fire pocket. There is a myth and story around how genes were constructed and they transmitted that story to the consumers and people started relating to that stories. The stories of uh Levice is a very interesting brand. The levice is one brand which never started from the top. What do you mean sir? Most of the brands are created very aspirational which starts from the upper echelons of the society. They wear it and then that style comes down. Correct. Denim was a style which came from the bottom of the society and it went up. It started on California gold rush. No. Yeah. So it started from workers or the miners at that point of time to going up to the highest level. So it's a very interesting case study of how a brand was built out of story of that time in a different way. And what is Levis India story? I think they they hopped on the imagery of the the original brand. Levis is a Levis was a synonym to a jeans and they played that story. Levis coming to India, jeans coming to India. They are the OG's of jeans and uh if you don't have a Levis pair in your wardrobe then you're not having any jeans. I think that was a position. Got it. So let's talk about how to break down Levis's brand persona and then study how they struck a resonance with their customers. How would you do that sir? So every modern consumers has to have a wardrobe or and that wardrobe has to comprise of a jeans and that genes has to be alise. But how do you make it mandatory? It's not mandatory. It's a psycho. It's a neuro image which you create in the mind of the consumer. And how do you create that neuro image? Through communication. Through whatever messaging you are doing. And how do you craft that messaging on what basis? That is what advertising is all about. That is what communication is all about. Walk me through this mur. How do you go about identifying a customer then crafting the messaging and then building your brand to strike resonance? So we have done it in all our brands. If you look at bear which was our denim brand we had uh we had built an image about bear as a very rebellious thing and uh and we we discovered that uh at the time in '90s when we were growing up we were not born to democratic parents. We had uh a parents which uh didn't want us to consume anything. Don't didn't want to try us make us try any new things. So we had to rebel. So that time the rebellion was quite a lot and we played on that thing about rebelliousness in the brand that time when we were building it. Beautiful. So you're saying that you have to first understand the story of your customers. When you understand the story of your customers, you'll be able to spot a sentiment that you can bank your brand on. In your case, it was rebellion. And then how did you craft your message for bear? I think that kind of whatever imagery we were creating was on that rebelliousness that time. For example, I I cannot uh there was something one of the ads uh got uh into trouble also. Okay. And uh we that time I think there was that Sanjayat uh thing he was a rebel of a very different kind. We we used that story in a very indirect form. Okay. to show revelation I there's some faint memories of uh what we did let's understand this using a modern example no sir you tell me any I think we do this uh day in day out I we would have built 120 brands till now so we have a whole theory of building a brand through a brand hopstead a brand star we have our own method I believe making a brand is like making a spaceship it has so many components it has to we have we create rituals around the brand we create role models around on the brand. We create symbols around the brands. We have a brand star which we make. Uh we look at the societal truth. We look at the competitive insights. So we do a lot of things around building a brand. Sir, this is beautiful. I want to go extremely deep into it. So walk me through the step-by-step process because you've said too many things and I want to almost break it down like a framework in a step-by-step process. So we want to build a brand. Let's say we want to build a skincare brand today. So I think the latest brand which I have helped as a mentor to a particular brand was a brand called Superu. Superu. Let's talk about Superu. Superu is a brand uh build on protein as a story and uh fortunately the entrepreneur in this brand is a nephew of mine and uh he and Ranir Singh co-created this brand. So when we look at Ranir as a personality, we thought uh there is no better personality to build a brand on protein like Ranir Singh because he exudes energy and protein in a way is all about energy and while conceptualizing the brand we saw the insight that if you create a brand with energy there is a great chance of being successful. So the brand was thought about in a way that any product which can makes you super youu you become much much better than yourself and that's what uh the star reflected the co-founder got it and we we looked at the personality of the co-founder and put that into the brand fully in whatever communication we do to whatever is doing and lovely and the best thing is the co-founder believes in it. He gets involved in the product. He looks at the product from a angle which no other co-founder must have ever done. For example, like making a product like we are just launching a new product which is just about to be launched called protein chips. I think his involvement in developing the product the taste factor to agreeing to the packaging to the communication to the style I think this kind of involvement is not seen and the brand exudes the personality of the co-founder. So before building superu what was your approach to understand okay we can build a product like superu I think we saw there is a gap in the market on the protein side and there is a brand to be built that gap people want to consume protein we are a protein deficient country there are people who are now exposed to the what do you call the world they are part of the gyming world they are part of the physical training world exercise world wherein protein is a very important component and then India is protein deficient as we know because our food habits are much it's much more different. So there was a need the younger generation don't want to consume the protein in the way the parents consume. They want to consume in a newer way. And our idea was to build a newer way of consumption of protein. We brought it in in wafer biscuits. Uh we brought it in now in chips. We are going to bring it in the the what do you call the powder form of uh we are calling it yeast protein. a new technology through which uh Nikuni is building it up. So there's the idea of a gap build a brand create the product create the communication and launch it. It has been probably one of the most successful launches uh in the FMCT business till date and uh I think they have achieved in 5 months with one single product with only four SKUs or now five SKUs they have achieved close to 100 cr annual run rate which is unheard of in 5 months. True. So uh when it comes to brand communication there are two sides to it. One is what exactly you ideated and how it got executed. Now walk me through how did you design the communication? You had a co-founder. You how did you pick Ranir Singh by the way? I think Nikunj and Ranir they knew each other. So they they have been working on toying up on the idea of uh I we came in as a mentor to help them not to make any mistakes in their journey of entrepreneurship. Okay. And uh I think that's what we did because we we come from the consumer side understanding and the brand understanding. Nikon and Ramir were working on the product side and I think I think as a mentor and uh to Nikon I think it became very interesting that uh he exudes energy and I come from the wisdom side. So this wisdom energy combination worked very well. Got it. Now how did you design the communication for superu? I think my brief to Nikon was only very simple. see that uh there is energy in whatever content you are creating. Secondly, every content show uh somebody having this product and enjoying it because that is the neuroiming you'll have to keep on building it up as an enjoyable protein product. You have to love consuming it. Just show that images. My only two brief was this nothing else. And could you walk me deeper into it? What do other protein brands do wrong? I don't know. I don't check on others because the one thing that I've seen is that when when it comes to other protein brands, they usually show fitness freaks consuming protein. Yeah. I don't think that way luckily. Okay. Because it's almost like the Safola mistake, right? When Safola first started, they only presented themselves as oil meant for people who have heart problems. And then eventually they realized that the TAM is too low. And then they expanded in such a way that they communicated the idea that if you do not want to have a heart problem then you must consume Safula. Suddenly the TAM exploded. Yeah. But we have been working around guilt-free consumption as an idea. But sir, how super you guiltfree? It's just a better for you product, right? That is guiltfree in a way. Okay. I would I would disagree on this because guilt-free would require you to have less carbs. Any consumption today people question it. Why am I consuming it? You have to remove that guilt. Why sir? New generation is questioning every consumption. Hm. So you are giving them a reason to consume. Okay. So superu is definitely better than a Cadbury. My question is first of all where do you place superu in terms of competitors? I don't want to place it anywhere. Why not? I I think we got the right spot luckily. But what is that right spot? Because the right spot is uh people are enjoying it. People are repeating it and people are loving it and people are loving it for the energy with the product is and it's a one of the truest celebrity launch product I would say in the history of this country. It reflects the personality of the founder. So now I want to talk to you about these terminologies that you mentioned societal truth. What exactly is the societal truth that you spoke about? I think society has certain codes about everything. Okay. Like society has a code about marriages. Society has code about festival. Society has created many many codes for us. Let's take superu for example. In this case, what exactly was that societal? The societal code is uh currently the societal code is it is a it's a it's a consumption which is an extra you don't need this consumption but then protein creates the need. Let's consume some we are protein deficient. Let's consume the protein. So the societal code is the it's a it's a more modern societal code and we are not dealing with a very traditional societal code. It still comes into the consumption of food. It's a kind of a snacking in between meals and it is a consumption which can sometimes it's a indulgence also. Got it. So over here societal code is we need to consume more protein. Yeah. And how do you think the societal codes would play out for a category like beauty? I think beauty the Indian societal codes are around beauty are quite quite interesting. They are around washing the hair. It's around making your eyes look beautiful and using a flower element in your hair. They were the traditional societal codes. Every community has their societal code. South India deals with hair quite a lot. Okay. and uh rest of the country I think uh eyes are have been one of the expression of beauty in this in this and how does that translate into and consu how does that look at look at all the songs written during the period of 60s or 70s around beauty would be around uh the moon the hair the face it was never about the skin as much there was a song We saw Chandan Sabadan which was more about the skin but otherwise beauty codes were all around uh face, eyes, hair to a great extent. And then we started saying gorier goreier. Yeah. Skin color was always there in this country. So that was never a doubt about it. Got it. So you're saying that the societal codes are in a way also born out of pop culture. They are born out of I would say mythology in a way or the old stories which resides in the society which are then amplified by pop culture right multiple things also pop culture also lyrics also songs also cinema the pop culture yeah and if I were to apply this in the context of superu how would that be I think we we were I think we have a full team of brand thinkers nikun had been earlier in uh some role in some food business. So he knew about the product the category. He himself is a gym goer. So he understand the he was a protein consumer. He had a co-founder who is a protein consumer. So firstly there is a truth that they are part of the consumption. Correct. Secondly they have a great intention of giving a great product with the brand personality comes in the energy of the founder. I think lot of things comes together to build a brand. So like five elements make the planet earth. There are multiple elements which makes the brand succeed. Then you spoke about ritual sir. What is customer rituals? I think every brand uh every category or every branditual. So let's take the case of superu. Super the rituals of the brand would be around in between meals situation situation. Wow. M I think sir Bellavita did this very well. They had uh four perfumes. One was club man, the other was CEO man and then they had oud and uh they had one more musk. So club man was meant for people going to the club and then they had CEO man for people who are going to the office because they wanted to feel like a CEO. Would you consider this to be customer rituals? I don't know. I'm talking of the communication brand communication. This is a product positioning and uh I would say merely Bella as a brand. I don't know whether it is talking to me or whether I'm a consumer because I don't I have not consumed their content yet. So I would rather put like superu if you have seen the content it will relate to anybody who is into high energy stuff. M got it understood. So brand ritual, customer ritual you're saying is how do you place your product in the day of the customer in various situations in the day of the customer. For example, if I have to talk about skincare, it's always in the morning right after taking bath. If I have to talk about cereals, it's during breakfast. Brand ritual becomes very important. Brand ritual eating sir dinner time. People usually consume our content during dinner time and when it comes to podcast it's usually during the flight. So during that time we get two and a half hours of an undistracted consumer who watches our content. Would you consider this to be brand ritual? Absolutely. So I I consumed your last content with uh Vidant or Manavar. It was on my last flight two days back from Bangalore to Bombay. What do you think about the podcast sir? Yeah I I was able to go through it fully. So I think it was a good content and a 24 year old boy talking loads and loads of sense. Yeah. Was quite quite fascinating and I was very fascinated by his story of uh how early age he got into business. So that fascinated me more than anything else. Sir very few people have been successful in raising sons who are that smart, that wise. What do you think results into that? Sometimes I get scared when the person is so wise at this age. Why sir? I don't know. At 24 when I look back I was I was absolutely dumbo in front of him. That's very interesting. So from here to where will he go up to is going to be very fascinating for me. True. Beautiful. But that was an interesting story. I I enjoyed the journey of his upbringing. Beautiful. Sir then you spoke about role models. Are these just brand ambassadors? I think people what happens uh we all need role models for me uh I have role models in life at various point of time in my life. I would have had role model who might be an author who might be a film star who might be one of the friends who I admire or some very successful business person and we started we start subconsciously aping them and I think that become very important in building a brand for example. Sirion event or life boost the secret of life. Today when I look at my my role models in podcaster I would have my role models in cinema I would have my role models in business I have my role models. those whom I look up to subconsciously you're aping that m how does this result into a consumer behavior that subconsciously if you are if I'm able to build that role models in my communication to you and I talk about them you will resonate with my brand for example how do how would a watch brand do it watch brand must be showing some celebrity wearing that watch or Roger Federer and tennis or sports leadership Roger Federer role model that brand will appeal to you. Correct. And if an entrepreneur does not have the budget to get a Roger Federer, Roger Federer, that role model who can play that archetype. How do you build that archetype? Just say for example, when it comes to Malbor man, Philip Morris built a great archetype out of the American masculine aspiration to then create Malbor man. So they understood that American men want to be rough and tough. They but they created a role model of a particular look of a particular way which is a cowboy which is a hat which is a horse and which is I think a particular imagery which they created. So I'm trying to understand how do you go about understanding role models and then emulate that in your brand communication. So if you are a watch startup who doesn't have the brand to get Roger Federer what should be your approach 8000 watch it is meant for people between the age of 18 to 25 and uh this watch is meant for only those people who see themselves as car enthusiasts So how would you communicate your idea enthusiast? In fact, I've invested in a company called Rutus which does exactly this. Mhm. So I want to understand how would you approach I think to engineering fast speed associate engine associate and I think auto I don't know how many people follow them but that's not widely not much. So now you'll have to look at somebody who is an uh who loves speed, who loves cars, who loves racing and you'll have to find a role model out there. Yeah, I'm not a person who follows that. So I wouldn't be able to know the names of the people. But I can tell you that there are there would be enough and enough of people on this circuit. So you're saying that whatever the customer aspires and whatever the story what so it's like a ven diagram. This is the customer story. This is the customer aspiration. And then you have the brand story. And you'll have to find a person or you'll have to create an archetype like Malber man who can fall exactly at the center. Totally. Is that correct? Totally. Okay. And when any consumer is seeing that, he is able to relate to it. Correct. Yes sir. Listen in the US they understood that in fact Listrine back then was a general liquid. It could be used for everything. It was more a lot of people say it was a floor cleaner also. Correct. It was a floor cleaner. And then they found out that if you have to resonate with the American public, you can't consider general public to be your audience. You have to choose one category. And then they chose women and then they understood the societal truth. In in in in marketing and brand parlance we call it the mating category. What do you mean by that? Boys category. Okay. Correct. Acts. Yeah. Clothing to a certain extent to dating mating category. It's for the other sex to be pleased. So these people understood that mouthwash could be a great solution because women always wanted to impress rich men which is why they came up with a term called heltosis where they said that if you have foul breath that is because of heltosis whereas that was just a general phenomenon that's how that's how body works and then they placed to you in this case if I have to understand this principle that you taught me the societal truth is women want to impress men totally Okay. The story of the brand is we will help you impress men and the story that they told the customer is that if you don't use listing you'll be single for life. on fear where there's an actress who's extremely beautiful but she's single because she's not able to get men. So would you consider this to be an application of the principle that you just taught me? Totally. Yes. Okay. Beautiful. So now let's come to what did you do after pantaloons? After pantaloons you started central then you had brand factory then you had several other brands. So when did you move out of clothing? I think big brother made us move out of clothing significantly because bigar core product was FM food and grocery and what made you move from clothing to grocery because they're two completely different domain. Yeah, we were I if you look at my backdrop was uh yarn manufacturer, fabric manufacturer, garment manufacturer, then a brand creator and then a retailer. Okay. And once you became a retailer, we thought uh if you are able to sell fashion, let's create the frequency of customers buying more with grocery. That's where the grocery came about. And uh the idea was to create a new kind of a bazaar in India where ordinary people can shop. Okay. Now when it comes to pantaloons and central what was the fundamental difference because they were all retail stores multipliers pantaloon was designed as a family store for every member of the family. Central was designed as a brand for a group of friends little younger than panthons. And thirdly, when bigar was designed, it was again designed for the family and a little younger family with younger children. Got it. And also a joint family as a idea. How did you scale so quickly sir? Because I was reading that you were present in what more than 400 uh cities around? Uh big mazar was present in close to 190 200 cities with easy day and other formats. We were present in 400 cities. But how did you scale so fast? Yeah. Was that I think that uh that was a different era. Okay. And we were the early players. We were getting successes wherever we were opening. Our model was quite interesting. Consumers were able to relate to us. And people used to say Big was also a symbol of progress in the country in a way progressive. Got it. So we were part of a consumption revolution which was happening in the country. Did you expand pantaloons using a franchise model? No, never. Why not sir? I personally don't believe in franchising model unless it's a it's a product wherein everything can be standardized in a clothing business to standardize quite a lot of things is very difficult. Why why don't you believe in franchise model imp everything is perfected to an extent wherein anybody else can replicate it without impacting the consumer but clothing difficult the customer service customer the motivation of a store franchisee for a smaller store may be okay but for a larger store very difficult why because you're dealing with multiple departments Like can you give me an example of the different clothing store? We were dealing with children. We were dealing with women. We were dealing with in woman ethnic department. I think people have done it very effectively in some other business models like Manu. Man virtually they might be running the store. Yeah, they run the store and they have taken the investment of the furniture fixtures and they pay the rent themselves. So it's a very different model wherein they are in control of the total customer experience. Then why couldn't you opt in for that model sir? Because if you have to expand it using your own money that would result into high capex. Yeah but maybe we didn't discover that model. Yeah, during that time it was not very popular. I think our capital investment was quite high. Like central used to be two lakh square stores two lakh square ft². One of our central was we had three four stores were which were in excess of two lakhs. So did you buy them or lease them? Lease them. And how much would that lease cost? At at our peak uh our total rental at future group would be 2,400 crores a year. My god. It was huge. including warehouses, including offices, including stores. So do you think a franchiseowned company operated model would have made you capex free? I think in hindsight one can say a lot but we had operating lease model also developed. So we we tried multiple things. Uh so I think it's a story of the past in a way. So one can always say in mindset this could have been done that could have been done because sir the reason why I consider it to be important is because even at think school we are trying to understand how do we scale our communication school and the first thing that comes to our mind is the franchise model um if you look at blueto guy subco they don't have a franchise model yet but eventually they might shift to a franchise model and the reason why people shift to I'm not a great believer of franchise model still oh why why not sir I think we can debate this because uh we have done some work around it Okay. And uh it can work not in all situation. It can work in some situation. That's my theory. Walk me through the situation sir. I think it's all upon uh what kind of customer experience you want to control. Okay. Do you think franchise model is possible in coffee like a blue tai model? I wouldn't know that business as much but there is a possibility out there but it's too early. You have to build the model perfect it. And I believe in when I look at the world now I came into business in late '80s and I when I look back in 2025 and uh I'll just give you a story I must have studied the organizational lifespan of organizations where in the this study I must have done it in '90s or 2000 that what is the leverage lifespan of an organization that time it was recorded was 26 years okay so organizations get built They go through their childhood. They go through their adolescence. They go through their teens. They go through their youth and some of most of the organization which survived more than 100 years didn't survive in its original form. Okay. For example, I would say Dupo lot of organizations except a financial organization which survives in its original form. When I did this research uh 3 4 years ago, the average lifespan of organization came down to 18 years. 18 years. This is still some years ago. If I do the research now, I think it will come down to less than 12 14 years. Okay. And I believe if I do the research after AI has been implemented or it has been adopted by businesses in the next 2 3 years, it will drop down to six seven years. So there is a impermanency as a thought which has to be designed for any new organization to be built. We are not permanent. We will not survive in our original form. Correct? Impermanency is a part of it. How do you deal with franchising in an impermanency kind of a situation? Let's take one category sir. Let's take food as a category. Very impermanency is built in into food. But if you were to understand the category of burgers, let's say, they have brought in permanency and tomorrow's business will not be in permanency as much as what the old era was. That's my theory. I can be wrong. There will be exceptions to every theory. So if you look at McDonald's which is a franchise example they they have perfected their menu to an extent wherein it can be soped or anybody can run it with some controls and some uh what do you call following or of the specifications to build a new businesses uh without that kind of perfection and franchising when impermanence is built into the model. How will a franchisee deal with impermanence? Sir, let's take Jumbo King because I understand the business model very well. Jumbo King sells burgers. Now, they keep changing their menus based on data and they get customer feedback actively from every franchise. And once data is understood very well, it is quite obvious to understand in which place what kind of burgers are doing well. And if you look at burger, it's a combination of only four things. If the variables are less, it's possible to franchise. Correct? In a fashion business, the amount of variables we were dealing with was so huge. We had around uh 16,000 SKUs in big bazada. How do you franchise that but man has been able to do that simply because of data sir? Mana is doing it because they still control the customer experience. So which means franchise model is possible if you're able to control the customer experience. Totally. I would love to control the customer experience. What are the factors that come under controlling customer experience? Managing it. All the rewards and uh recognition is given by you to the people who are working. For example, let's break this down. If there is a store staff or the store head or store manager, store, whatever you call him, he's under whose control and what is his motivation? If he's under the control of a franchisee, so franchisee will create a reward system for him which not which will not suit to the brand. So you're saying we should first control the employee incentives, entire customer experience and who first who provides for that customer experience? First is the is the product product it's a service and it is after sale service and the total vibe or the environment which you create which is basically infrastructure. Yeah. Total vibe and the environment and how do you maintain that very early in my life I did the customer experience is not the same. It's a very it's a art which has to be perfected. But do you think because of digitalization and data analysis this could become easier? It's possible. It's much much better than what it used to be earlier. But then there is a new theory of impermanence which has shaped it. You will not survive in your original firm. You'll have to keep on pivoting your businesses. Correct. But data will tell you where to pivot. Right. Yeah. But then there will be too much of a change. How will you keep on training your people the franchisee to deal with that? But sir impermanency whatever whatever impermanency comes out of data it's not so I think there would be revolutionary impermanency which is sipping in. Sir let's debate this out. subject futuristic businesses are all heading towards impermanence. Understood sir. Now when it comes to food business, you said that franchising is very very difficult. But why is that? Food business may franchising is still easier than the clothing business. That's what I said. Okay. But you said that the franchising will not work for a category like food in the future. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that franchising may wherever you can control the customer experience, it will work and where the number of variables are less. Wherever you can standardize things. Got when you deal with impermanence, you cannot standardize things and you're saying fashion is once and your variables will keep on coming up again and again. Now when it comes to fashion, let's say you run a company operated franchise own store, the franchisees just put in the investment. You are managing the company, the store staff is rewarded by you. Where is the issue? Which will require you to not I think that's not franchising. That's a financing model. H but we're just putting it under the franchising is where the franchise is the operator where that is where I have concern. Understood. So you're saying that a franchise owned franchise operated model is a bad model. I'm not saying it's a bad model. I'm saying that uh the customer experience is controlled by them. So you are not in control of your fortunes. So any place where you're dependent on the franchise operation is where the threat is. It's not a threat. It's a it has to be perfected model there. Your variables have to be low and you have to be in control of the franchisee who is giving that experience to the consumer because he's using your brand because human dependence and that's where the impermanencies will kick in and you have no data to be able to track that until the harm has already been done. For example, if there's a store manager who does not know how to behave, you will see the impact in the customer experience way later as compared to when you should have. So that is where you can't perfect human impermanencies. But if this person is the franchise owner, the likelihood of him not behaving properly is very less. You're dealing with that variables which is not in your control. But that is going to be an impermanency. Even when there is an employee of yours who's going to be at the store, right? I think still he's rewarded by you and incentivized by you. You can hire and fire him. But so but you can even fire the franchise owner. Not easy. Why not sir? It's not easy. But why is there a legal complication to that? There are a lot of issues to that because the property is in his nameally. Got it. So again that you have to control the customer experience. So you will have to I would like to be in control of the customer experience in a franchising system. That's it. If it can be perfected, why not? I'm not against any model as such. Every kind of model works in certain situations, not in all situations. Understood? So the conclusion is your variables have to be less your impermanencies have to be controlled and because of data today it has become comparatively easier and the more you have dependency on the operations of the franchise owner that's where complications will kick in so if it is a franchise operated by the company where you can control the variables it is great and the variables are a function of product service environment and infrastructure I'll just tell you very softer thing now if you go to any particular store you can feel the energy of that store I don't know how to quantify it but you feel it and that is the sum total of the effort put into that store consistently but as a as a brand owner you will put in that effort for sure franchisee how is he motivated or incentivized to put in that extra effort understood got it so that is the reason why you did not expand pant loons using the fun I don't know what I did that time but I'm talking of franchising as a concept got it and then When you stepped into Big Bazar, how was Big Bazar born as an idea? How did you spot that opportunity? I think India was a full India is full of bajars now also. Correct. And I think after liberalization consumption of new categories was happening and how do new categories needs a particular environment to sell and consumption can be created if you create an environment to sell. I think if you look at the history of communication, we as a civilization, our first communication modes were oral, katas, uh people hearing somebody. Then came in the press where there is a authoritarian author learned person who is talking and lot of people listening to him. Then came television which was which actually created brands which actually created businesses and consumption because it was one visual medium where in advertising through you could work on the imaging of the consumers a centralized medium which could appeal to millions and millions of people that's why brands got built that's where FMCG companies got built that is when the retailers got built to a great extent now we are back to social media which is not a centralized media of communication So the world is changing again. A influencer can appeal to x number of people. There is no centralized medium of communication. So we have to think about brands in a very different way, consumption in a different way. So that's what uh the world is moving towards and that's where I believe the impermanence is setting in because if you look at uh the consumers in the original days when there was oral form of communication they had all the time in the world to consume that communication and ponder over it think over it. Correct. When press came in, we had again lot of time to think, write a letter to that person, get into that thinking. Television may we believed whatever they were saying, dust us, the consumption, we tried every product, then we made our own judgment. Now we are again in a world of communication wherein we are consuming so much of content our span of attention and our theory to reflect back or to consume that content and process it doesn't exist. So we are in a new world and this new world is creating new brands, new products, new consumers and we have to be relevant to them. So back in the day what was this paradigm shift that inspired you to start big business? Yeah, I think television newspapers were the medium of to create uh demand, create new categories, build new products, build new set of consumers. It was huge. It was crazy. What time was this sir? Which year? I think we started uh big sometime in 2000. 2000. So this is when liberalization was at its peak. Yeah. Yeah. It was like we've created so many categories in the country. M like we were once upon a time 15% of luggage trade in the country itself we luggage 15% of the total luggage trade general trade modern trade all put together. Oh wow. We were we must be percentage of most of the sales in the country. So it was a different era where consumption uh you could work on creating consumption. People were wanting to experiment things were happening. Got it. So from the economic standpoint if I were to see the per capita income was increasing drastically. Number two the medium India had a huge amount of savings. Uh if you look at the savings then and the savings now it has all gone into sir yesterday I was reading a stat which said India savings is at a 47 year old low. So that's what I'm saying we were responsible to reduce the savings of this country in a way. So there was money aspirations were rising liberalization was happening. the next generation was getting into a little bit of abundance I would say. So India as a society like when I was growing up I'm a I have been born in 60s. So the movies which we were seeing were all around shortages. We were not a abundant economy. We were just building our infrastructure, education products were not available. So we were born in a era of look at today's generation. We are abundance like abundance personified everything is there. So the world is changing. That's what I'm saying. the impermanence is seeping in much earlier. We we don't know what are we going to get into and our our attention spent to process doesn't exist. So it's a new generation. It's a new world. It's a new consumption. It it will be very interesting to build brands here now. Very beautiful. So I've understood that savings were very high comparatively comp as compared to today. Income was rising and you had consumption rising and you could actually fuel in consumption because of television. huge television and press both used to work. There was a time when press and television work together. It was crazy. What do you mean by that sir? Front page ad used to get us crowds like unreal. Today if you advertise front page the crowds which will come will be nowhere. So how effective was this front page ad in terms of numbers you can't imagine that was the power. Wow. Zero comparison. And how much did the front page ad cost you? Because we were operating at a scale. I'll give you a very interesting example sir. This is the story of uh last to last week. My friend Ana is conducting an AI workshop with economic times. He went to ED said I want to advertise on your newspaper. So we were like an why are you advertising on a newspaper? He said I just want to give it a shot. Sir, he was able to sell courses worth 50 lakhs. But that's a very specified cost and because he's doing it in collaboration with ET, he's getting a certain percentage out of it. But 50 lakh worth of sales because of a newspaper ad for AI. So let's not uh I think the effectiveness of ad today it's only for specific categories you can do communication. Which categories do you think are relevant for newspapers even today? I don't know. A launch any announcements. Not to do sales as much as announcement and launches. But how effective do you think these announcements are? Are announcements even? I think you need to announce something nowadays. Whenever you're launching a big thing, you have to announce I think uh real estate is still using it effectively. Announcing today I think a new serial is being launched called royals. Those announcement front page times of India you it is used for announcements. Got it. Understood. So then when you started Big Bazar, it started with just one store. We did three stores in 22 days. The idea was to three stores in 22 days. Yeah. It was about scale. Which city did you start from? I think it was Bangalore, Hyderabad. Which is Kolkata. Kolkata. And what was the model like? Like what was the difference between a big bazaar and a normal retail store in terms of cost? size, the way we used to put in the goods, the assortment and the prices. What went what went into it was a feel of a bazar of a bazar in air conditioned environment. What was your societal truth that you were banking on? I think the societal truth of a heart and a we are used to that hustle and bustle clean that was a big societal truth because speak and spend hospital and spend hustle and bustle hustle and bustle I used to call it the butt and brush theory if you have not buted and brushed into somebody you're not shopping things have changed from there now M now we want things neat and clean. Yeah. Now things are very different. Yeah. So interestingly Sam Walton also said the same thing. He said that uh when he opened his first Walmart, he wanted it to be dirty because he wanted that store to look like a store where you could find cheap stuff. And uh his theory was if he spent too much on the air conditioning, a his cost was a a his cost would rise and b he would scare the common man away. And now that you saying about big bazar, it's very similar. It was very welcoming sir distinct memory when I first walked into big bazar. I saw the largest pack of parley g I had ever seen. Yeah, that was something which we did to sell huge huge packs. It was madness s and I saw surfexel which was so huge and when you see things that huge you get this feeling of abundance right that's such a distinct we played on abundance significantly what do you think worked for big bazar very well sir apart from just the pricing I think connecting with the consumers and being honest and truthful about oneself how can a bazar connect with the customer sir connect energy I I am a lot of believer in energy which is very difficult to rationalize and quantify but what was a brief to the team because you energy energy comes from everywhere future group staff was always energetic environment was always electrifying office environment was electrifying mission I think that's what people have enjoyed working at future group and I sometimes when I'm talking I'm missing it but otherwise I don't look back that energy was very infectious how do you think future retail was different from demart I I think we were different born in a different era, different style of working, different uh aspirations, different imagination. Would you put yourself in the same category as Demart? No. Demart has a different consumer audience. Demart has lot of beauty. Demart is one company from which I have learned not to have many variables in life. Okay. Can you like they work on a x number of store they they cater to India to a new development or a new app. So they have defined the model. We were a product of a malls. We started with catering to India one more than India 2. India 2 we used to get them during events and festivals. So it was very different audiences. Secondly they they used to own the property. They I think the beauty of demart is the number of variables they use is much lesser. They say no to more things then they say yes. I think we were exactly the opposite. So very different and our aspiration was to capture the consumption of Indian consumer. I think that's where we were very different. Got it. And even big bazar was not franchised. Never. Never. Never. So you paid rent for all the stores everywhere. So when you chose a location for big bazar what went into the calculation? I think we were very early players real estate when I look back we were good in real estate here in hindsight. I think we were very early players and we couldn't have gone wrong because India we knew where the catchments were where the India one or the aspirational India lived and So that was not so difficult as such you need data and where can you fet this data from data and the number of houses number of apartments data is not difficult so let's say a brand like zodia wants to establish itself in Mumbai data how would you now they have made a real estate strategy which is interesting so they they are doing 70 80% of the stores in high streets. Okay. They are not doing in malls. They build the store facade will build the brand. So they are building very interesting facads, glass facads. The store which is visible whenever you pass by. So they are building a holding along with the brand which is a very smart strategy. So they built a new interesting real estate strategy which is not dependent on malls. But Westside is always like that. No sir. Westside was in malls much much more than what Zio is. Judio standalone. Studio standalone is much much they are they have stores in malls but malls is not their core strategy. But isn't like mall but aren't malls a more convenient strategy? Mall cost of doing business becomes high because of the common area maintenance. Got it. If you were to if you were to explain the difference between the real estate cost of a mall versus a standalone store what would that be sir? I think I think basic difference plus I think uh in a standalone you might get a property 20 25% cheaper the cost difference can be to the extent of depending 25 to 50%. 25 to 50% depending how should a brand decide he's depending on the mall to pull in customers for you. That's where the cost of acquiring a customer comes down in a mall. Sir, how should an entrepreneur choose between getting into a mall or putting up a standalone store? I think stand they will be seeing your product your brand you get customer acquisition and Mumbai do you think traffic plays an important role everywhere it plays a roa because in Mumbai more often than not I would rather get into a mall than getting into a standalone store merely because of parking. I think everything makes a difference today. So as an entrepreneur, what would be the four or five checkpoints that you need to consider before choosing between a mall and a standalone store? I think you should try both. You'll come to know. Secondly, brand uh once your brand becomes I would rather use a mix of strategy of standalone and molds. Okay. So you're saying which malls standalone. Okay. malls like if you look at the new brand which has come about in clothing now that is a snitch there is a newi numei has a strategy of malls snitch has opened some standalones also and they are in malls also so I think everybody's experimenting and while a new brand is being built but I think new brand online build and standalone experiment because malls have a role to play but all can't deliver you the output. Why not? Malls locations mixate depend. So, so you're saying that you need to consider the tenant mix, the location of the mall, the cost, and your brand. Yeah. and your long-term vision of your brand because your customer is passing through that place and seeing your brand every day and you will not be able to take a big place or show a facade, show the brand personality in full. If you were to if you were to break down the most powerful attributes of big bazar that turned it into a successful organization, it cannot be just real estate. You did several things, right? I think a lot of five elements have to come together. Which are those five elements? I would say product, pricing, the promotions which we did, the vibe and the environment which we create the hustle and bustle please. And fifth is the energy and the team people. When it comes to product, I understand this to be I think we played a lot in category. What do you mean by that? We virtually worked on creating categories because we were the phase when we transitioned from washing to what you call the soap soap. Yeah. Soap participate. So how did you effectively transition a customer? I think you have to create that category, talk about it, makes make noise, create events around it and do all that things. Yeah. Walk me through one example. I think I remember uh like uh I would say soaps as a category uh premiumization of soaps. Can you go deeper into this sir? I don't remember the category but luggage as a category I remember how we created it luggage we identified a big insight luggage set during weddings set. We virtually created this category. But how did you collect this data from the ground? I think but so this has to travel from your ground staff all the way to the management. I think this is our life incidences also. If you are a observer of society, if you are keeping your eyes and ears open, you will keep on knowing this. You don't need big great level of ground research to do all these things. Yeah. And any category creation when I remember when VHS player came about, DVD players at a particular price point, we had a particular metal bed bad all this category creation from one product to another upgradation. I think that's where we played a role. Got it. So I am looking at this as a framework and if I have to understand how did your think tank operate so at the grassroot level you identified what exactly is the customer using right now. Then you look at okay because I'm not able to understand from 16 17 years we have been doing maybe now it's 20 years we have been doing a project called bat dashan wherein our team stays in particular towns and uh villages and we observe the societal change from what we saw last and whatever we are hearing. So we have observed the change of the girl child getting importance which imple which which influenced all our addition we started sponsoring miss India after that we we went into women's wear in a very significant way we invested in ba and at that point of time the woman as a category invest just to understand from a societal trend which picked up Indian society woman is now getting respect even in Hana Rajasthan everywhere I think that changed our approach to business also we saw a a societal trend that every small town may English speaking classes are coming like crazy. So that aspiration of learning English was another societal trend which we realized as a then we recognized the role of uh the society parent how does the family functions what is the relation between the son and a father the father uh and a daughter relationship I think this relationship tells us about how the society functions and how does how did that insight create a business opportunity for you I think it you it helps us in communication What kind of communication you have to do which will appeal like the role model communication and in this case if I were to understand which product did you sell because of understanding this communication I think when we started big bazar we knew that the kitchen is with the mother-in-law correct and we have to convince her and daughter-in-law convince societal change told us that we used to get we used to if you look at bodar images you will always see woman shopping with a child in the trolley and a very happy feeling. Then we started showing a mother-in-law in the images, daughter-in-law imaging. So what neuro images you throw out is also very important. Whom are you talking to is very important. So this societal observation tells you a story around how what kind of people what kind of communication what should you do. Wow. Beautiful insider. So you are saying I'll give you an example and you tell me if I'm getting it right. Let's talk about Netflix. When HBO and Netflix went headon, HBO was under the assumption that the father is going to decide what is going to be watched by the family. As in the subscription, which subscription are we going to buy was decided by the father. Netflix realized that there is a societal norm that's coming up whereby the CTO of the house is actually the younger son. So if the younger son decides that we should subscribe to Netflix and Amazon Prime then the house will eventually subscribe to Netflix and Amazon Prime instead of competing with HBO to strike resonance with the fathers they struck resonance with the next generation and that is how they became relevant and eventually when this generation grew up Netflix and Amazon Prime went mainstream. So the story of the CTO now emerging. So the story of now the son emerging as the CTO was the societal truth which they banged on to create neuroimage of all kids and young people watching Netflix and Netflix and chill became a Gen Z concept and when they eventually became the deciders of what needs to be watched the entire house started watching Netflix and that's how Netflix achieved penetration. Would this be a good application? Absolutely correct. But once you then we decided the mother-in-law joint family system was breaking down nuclear families in urban centers. So it became nuclear families. So our communication in urban centers totally changed to the the the son and the wife and the children in our communication. The the towns and the smaller towns we the power was still with the mother-in-law. Okay. And it was very interesting when we realized that the m the daughter used to take advice from her mother and they might be in separate towns or where to shop their grocery from because the mother daughter is married and she's moved to another town and that's where big brother used to play a lot of role in terms of how do we get her daughter to shop with us. How did you do this sir? I think it's subtle communication. I think mother and daughters this is one combination we always look at and how do the store managers use that data to generate sales soft what are the profile of customers what what combination they're coming in. People don't show up alone in this country as much. So I'll give you one example and again you tell me if this is a good application. When I went to buy my first car, I was the one buying the car but the salesman did not pay heed to me at all. He was talking to my father only because I'm assuming that he's he's been told the story that fathers are eventually going to decide. He's not changed. That salesman has not changed. Got it. So I would rather now look at the younger generation deciding everything. be power lies not with the parent as much as what it lies because it's a very democratic set of uh consumers. Now my children are born to a democratic parent. They have they can influence me now and our grandchildren can influence anybody. So and secondly the society this new society is of born in abundance. Beautiful. So what you're saying is your brand story and brand communication has to fundamentally stem from a societal truth and in this case you'll have to understand the family properly to understand each person's role to then understand who should you talk to and who should you convince to drive sales. Okay, one example of that was Netflix. The other example is the one that I gave you for a car salesman. And because this cars I'm trying to imagine the impact of this like if there's a brief that comes out from MG and BMW and all these automotive companies to their stores that you need to go and target the youngest person who's visiting the store that will actually change the game altogether because if the younger person I mean in this case the son is the decider of which car to buy and the salesman puts in efforts to convince the father and eventually when when this family goes on to a different store and let's Say the Mercedes guy tries to convince the son and the son is convinced the son will actually change the decision of the father to go from buying BMW to buying Mercedes and when this happens at scale it's a billion dollar opportunity. Yeah, but that's the way if you look at the you know cinemas reflect this very well. There was a cinema called there was a parent that Amirish Puri and who was the head and the authority of the family. In the last scene he says Simani. So he succumbed but there was a fight for that and that fight was what people loved the generational fight. That movie worked so well on that generational fight that I don't want to leave away tradition. I don't want to run away. I would love to convince. And the villain was the father and he succumbs to his daughter. I think that was the game-changing movie to see the change of society which happened. Beautiful. In fact, sir, when I was watching the Netflix documentary on I think it's called Romantics. Romantics Chopraas. Yeah. There I think Adita Chopra mentioned this. He said that the reason why DDLJ worked very well was not because of the story but the encapsulation of all the characters in the story which exactly reflected what parents wanted and what the kids wanted. The kids got the the the the children got what they wanted which is the love of their life and the parents got what they wanted which is respect and eventually everybody's happy. So it was a win-win both. That is what Indian society is all about. If you're talking of societal truth that was a reflection of societal truth. Yeah. Likewise Santosh my colleague he has coined a very interesting word of modernity. He says modernity in India is negotiated tradition. Modernity in India is is equal to negotiated tradition. Okay. We we negotiate without tradition. We'll still play garba but on a disco music. So we will never leave our roots but we'll adopt to anything which is modern. As a brand how can you leverage this? Can you give me an example? Let's take the example of ethnic wear. How can an ethnic wear brand leverage the societal truth to strike resonance with their customers? I think ethnic wear is a big sufferer if you ask me because we were part of the BBA story to a certain extent. uh we had a huge clothing brand called 60 which was a,000 cr plus brand and we were into multiple I believe the brand players on the ethnic wear is not playing smart enough to make their relevance uh permanent in a way okay and uh I think there is a work to be done there where where are they going wrong sir I think they're not fighting with the new uh I would say the new imaging which is coming about they have not played anything Well, to make their uh ethnic wear survive in in whichever form they have to mo they have to get into something but nobody's working hard on that like can you give me a stark example what are the brands doing right now and what should they be doing I think ethnic branding this category will die this category is getting attacked from everywhere and they are not working hard enough to protect this category. And if you were to be an ethnic wear entrepreneur today, what would you do now? I would do I would I will create new products, new style, new imagination getting new set of influencers and getting in this as something which we as a I think it's you have to talk about the virtues and the personalities and create fashion around it and create and imaging around it which makes people feel that those who are wearing this are the the people. What image would you create right now? It has to be around fashion and it has to be around the society in some way like yeah maybe understood. Got it. So now I want to come back to big bazar and I understood one very important lesson over here that you understood the family persona. Now it's no longer a customer persona. understood family portion very well which then helped you generate sales in places where it was quite counterintuitive to generate sales because while most people would think discounts alone will work you understood the story of the customer which enabled you to scale up very very quickly. Now sir when you were scaling up very very quickly what would you say were the mistakes that you made which nobody else should repeat? I think I always believe that in hindsight now when I look back uh since uh future group is in a way no more that uh we didn't uh we were more in creation rather than in optimization. I when I meet the new age entrepreneurs I learn something I've learned something from them is they are great optimizers. They come from engineering background. They optimize for everything. Had we got that kind of talent of optimizing like the models which we build were unbelievable. We had the we had a great team. We had the ability to pivot. We had the we had the flexibility. We were not a rigid organization. We had every quality what a modern organization should have and we could grow. We could manage change. We had a great uh people policy as such. We enjoyed creation. I think we should have enjoyed optimization also. Can you give me an example? I I I think optimization means uh you have a retail space cost. Now how do we optimize for every inch of square foot? How do we optimize on margins and keep on increasing it? How do we optimize for another income? How do we optimize for cost? How do we look at each and every line item of cost and kept? There has to be a parallel organization which is optimizing everything what you are doing. Basically good frugality. I think it's much much beyond that today's uh with today data being available and the kind of uh engineering mindset which you can build in an organization you can optimize like the new age companies like uh I would say the zepptos and the blinkets they are unbelievable optimizer because they have to deliver in 10 minutes they have to work on that speed they have to earn that margin the optimizing that what they are doing I think that theory if you could have brought in earlier it would have been a different different world only. So the message to all the entrepreneurs is that no matter what you're doing, you could be doing great work but you have to optimize it to an extent where it is super efficient. No, I have a view that don't get excited with your successes. Your optimization is ultimately the winning point. Nothing else matters. You'll be good at everything. Your top line will be fantastic. You might be earning but optim you optimize to the bottomest of rupee bottom of P. Just say if we have a clothing brand if they have a wastage of 2%. They should bring it down to 1%. Maybe maybe lower than that also. Optimizing not only to that extent optimizing to speed how much of stock turns you are doing. Optimize to every SKU level how much fast it is selling at this quantity of production how much cost you can bring down. Optimizing to every SKU optimizing to every point is optimization. I think now data can be looked from one product. So how do you optimize on every account? Optimize your every communication optimize every real optimization is a subject how it can be brought into the organization. Got it. So that's one. Number two would be I think only one thing optimiz only optimize. Then secondly uh balance sheet. M balance sheet is everything not your P&L. M so in your case from my research I understood that you had very high debt. Now in business you eventually have to take up debt if you want to do something of that scale. But what is the difference between good debt and bad debt? How do you assess it? I think that is a debt only. That is a burden and uh debt is all you know the problem in debt what happens is debt once it comes in your balance sheet again and again you are when it is going to be paid how does your business is going to repay debt your businesses are created to service debt not to repay debt I think we have to create businesses to repay debt can you give me can you can you give me an example of this s because I understood what I said I understood what you said but I want to make sure that everybody Nobody else also understands in a more simpler manner. So business may the banks when they are giving you loan they look at the service coverage ratio whether you'll be able to service debt they have some formulas in which but then you keep on growing business sir debt service you speaking about when you take up debt the banks look at DSCR the debt service ratio coverage ratios and all and we keep on growing actually the model of giving that or servicing that was not built on uh growth as much it was a factory-driven environment you're putting up a factory factory retail businesses like we must have compounded for multiple years at around 27 28%. Growth was inbuilt in our business. So secondly we had no other means equity was blocked because FDI was not allowed in retail. So we were working with lot of limitations and growth and people were consumers were liking on whatever we were growing. So that was the way of growth and probably and when COVID came in we were the first who were impacted the most because 65% of our business were in malls correct so there was no way out and they were the last to open up and then the society I think the habits a lot of things changed so we had no other option but to sell out so that everything could get clear so life became very different what what exactly was that all about s because it never we never really understood what is it is the matter is legally subjudicious in a way that uh we Amazon had invested in our parent company through which uh uh we were to be along with them in terms of they'll help us and we will be able to solve nothing happened and uh we had no other option to sell they objected to our selling M and uh we had found out a solution everything was getting cleared up and everything would have survived but somehow they told it then things didn't happen the way it should have happened and things came to a stand. My last two questions are about the next generation. You've been such a stark observer of the societal norms and what is changing and what is not changing. When it comes to genzes what are the strengths and weaknesses that you see in the upcoming generation? I'm very fascinated by this generation because they are uh when I look at uh people who are born in a very abundant environment coming from urban towns or very towns like Mumbai and all they are very different than the people who are coming from smaller towns still in abundance but the hunger is different the understanding of life is different the understanding of lifestyle is different and I'm finding a lot of new entrepreneurs uh very very fascinating that uh they have formed a view which is very different and contrary to the view which we have been born up with. So we are finding a mix of things but but very good energy very good knowledge and and zeal and passion to do something and where are the problems which I think the biggest problem which I find in them is one that they want all want to start from a problem statement. M what do you mean by that they say there was this problem and we want to solve this but that's a good thing no I don't think so there's any problem firstly fundamentally okay you problem I think problem to start on a problem and solving that I think it's a Californian way of looking at a business so but how do you go about building a business because we've always been told that you need to look at a problem and then build a business I don't know I I have never thought that way problem problem I don't understand problem now these are new created problems first marketing is all about creating a problem and creating a solution for it so then tell us that you're doing this currently there's no problem you are saying that I'll create this problem and solve it that still is a business model got it I think they start on a point which is solving a problem which I don't subscribe to as much but what do you think they should do. They say we'll create this problem and we'll solve it. So you're saying being open being more self-aware. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. They're not solving any problem. That is the first thing. So but do you think they should actually figure out a problem and solve it? I don't know. World problem. For example, business education in India is a big problem. We want to solve. I know I have a different view. I believe that the society is changing. The newer generation wants to consume not the way their parents consume. They are rebelling in consumption. Now we rebelled in terms of the way we approach the society and the societal norms. We rebelled against that. The new the new generation is rebelling in the consumption. They don't want to consume what their parents consume. That is their way of showing rebellion. Be a part of that consumption. That's not solving a problem. You are participating in the new consumption which is happening. You are participating in the rebellion of the new consumer. And attitude wise, do you see a problem with the genesis? I don't know. I I don't think so. I I believe that every generation has to be different. Correct. We can't be clones of the previous generation and luckily it's not happening because we're seeing a lot of reports which say that Jenzies often have a lack of commitment. Instant gratit. You don't think so? I don't think so. They are born in a different environment. They are consuming different content. They are consuming much much more than what we consume. It's a new way of living. Because to me because I'm a part of this generation I understand that not to be lack of commitment but the desire for change and the desire for upgradation very very quickly which is a good thing. I think but how does it matter? I think their respect for the society still remains their commitment to life still remains. nervous no emotions they go through music life doesn't change much here human beings are human beings they have the same greed hunger passion energy I think what they consuming is changing the way they are consuming is changing the delivery formats are changing but same year they are adding more supplements to their food correct so there is something which is getting added up in there but that's the way society is going to be beautiful sir thank you so much for spending spending so much time with us. It was it was amazing. Sir and you told me one thing that busy founders are never great and great founders are never busy. I executed that in the next 12 months and today we are far far better as compared to where we were back then. And because of you, I learned to build systems so that I can spend time thinking and focusing on strategy rather than just being very very tactical. So I have a very interesting theory on business. uh yeah business has to start with strategy then is designing how do you organize yourself to work on that strategy how do you design your business how do you design your organization design your products third is execution what I'm finding the biggest problem in today's generation is they are straight away getting into execution strategy is less than execution is more strategy design is the most important thing but how you design your life around execution. Everybody in the new generation is trained for execution. Sir, what would be the three books that you would recommend to the next generation so that they can learn this?
