1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,680
Our goods trains they move at a speed

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,600
that is slower than an activa whereas in

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,000
China it's three times faster. China is

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,240
a very different country. China plans

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,720
for 100 years. But how do they do that?

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,359
India 1 consumes maybe 100,000 items in

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,680
their lifetime. India 2 consumes 10,000

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,519
items in their lifetime. India 3

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,600
consumes not more than thousand items in

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,359
their lifetime. We were responsible to

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,920
reduce the savings of this country in a

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,160
way. For someone who is one of India's

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,079
biggest retailers, he's also one of our

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,160
most unassuming billionaires. Kishar

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,680
Bani, we are going to be a $1 trillion

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,200
economy in terms of consumption. How was

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,120
Big Bazar born as an idea? How did you

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,480
spot that opportunity? In hindsight, I

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
think we were very early play and we

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,160
couldn't have gone wrong. Big Bazar,

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,840
part of the future group is pioneered

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
the modern trade revolution in

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,039
India. I prefer to go on Wednesday. Why?

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
because lot of

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,480
discount is available. Did you expand

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,960
pantaloons using a franchise model? No,

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,119
never. Why not? So I personally don't

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,040
believe in franchising model unless it's

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,720
a I did this research uh 3 4 years ago.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,520
The average lifespan of organization

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,320
came down to 18 years. 18 years. If I do

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,000
the research now, I think it will come

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,520
down to less than like

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But aren't balls a more convenient

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,600
strategy? when covid came in we were the

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,520
first who were impacted the most because

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,920
65% of our business were in malls

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
correct and then the society I think the

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,520
habits a lot of things changed so we had

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,520
no other option but to sell out

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,119
fight life became very different what

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
what exactly was that fight all about

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,399
sir because it never we never really

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,720
understood what exactly was it about

45
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,879
uh

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,879
[Music]

47
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:05,680
[Music]

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,520
We before we move on, I would like to

and try ODO inventory

83
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,319
today. Sir, what do you think about

84
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,040
India's growth story?

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,120
India is an interesting country which is

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,680
learning to consume, which is learning

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,519
to have aspirations, which is following

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,280
the media, social media trends of the

89
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,319
world. And we are uniquely designed. We

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,120
are a country of six major religion,

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:46,080
6,000 cast and subcasts, 29

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,000
states and 19 nearly 18 to 19% of the

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
world's population.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,239
We will definitely make an impact if we

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
consume more or if we participate in the

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,519
economy to the world economy in a way.

97
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,680
So India has to grow. How much it will

98
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,560
grow, how will it grow will depend on

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,959
many many factors according to me. But

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
uh it's time for India in a way but

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,519
that's been the time for a long long

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,959
time. Our population demographics, our

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,879
infrastructure, I think India has done

104
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
very well on building infrastructure

105
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,639
which allows the growth to happen. I

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,919
think we have built airports, we have

107
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
built good roads, we have built good

108
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,720
ports from where we were, I think we

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
have done a very decent job in building

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,880
infrastructure. So if you do a

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,479
benchmarking from where we were, we've

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,759
definitely done a good job. Fantastic.

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,080
But then I was just studying India's

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,520
logistics and we have a broken logistic

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,440
system. Yeah, but it's not it's

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,360
improving. Let's our logistic cost uh is

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,040
more than

118
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,840
11%. It should come down to 7% of your

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,919
GDP. Correct.

120
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,520
So how is that going to come down? It

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
logistic and supply chain is a very

122
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
complex subject just because we whenever

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
we build an industry we have to build

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,840
the entire ecosystem for this industry.

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,680
We were not designed that way and I

126
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,280
think the way China is designed wherein

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
they have built cities of a particular

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,000
product they have built infrastructure

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,960
supply chain I think it's taking time up

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,680
government has taken some uh move on

131
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,039
that in terms of uh building a a city

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,759
for a category kind of product we need

133
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,440
to do a lot to get into that kind of

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
supply chain that kind of efficiency

135
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
that kind of logistic cost but India has

136
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
built highways India has built

137
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,400
infrastructure

138
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,720
Now it's for us to I think it's all

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
about entrepreneurship. How

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,800
entrepreneurs new entrepreneurs will

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
come in and develop this country. But

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
sir, how are we going to do that?

143
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,720
Because I was studying some stat to

144
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,320
understand the progress of India in

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,280
terms of logistics. Our goods train they

146
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,560
move at a speed of 25 km/ hour on an

147
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,840
average. I think if you look at it, we

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,000
are the only country which is delivering

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,680
in 10 minutes products at people's home.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,960
But that is also logistics. But that is

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
last mile. No sir. But that is also

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,720
logistics. Yeah, that is logistics.

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,479
India will s India will always surprise

154
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,479
you in doing some things in a great

155
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,400
manner and something not in so great

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,160
manner. I think we have we have to fix a

157
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,800
lot of things. Lot of things have to

158
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,440
come together. But quick commerce this

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,919
is still restricted to only the India

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,240
one. I'm not talking about I think India

161
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,400
will see beauty of India happening

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,759
somewhere and not so good things

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,280
happening somewhere. So a lot of things

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,600
have to come together to get everything

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
right. M but logistics definitely has to

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
come together. Lot of things have to

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,759
come together. M but our goods trains

168
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,479
they move at a speed that is slower than

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,680
an activa whereas in China it's three

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,600
times faster. China China is a very

171
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,080
different country. China plans for 100

172
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,919
years. China has destroyed its past.

173
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,919
China 20 years ago took a lot of

174
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,600
decisions around how education, how

175
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,759
gaming, how investment banking and they

176
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,000
they kind of reimagined the country in a

177
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,639
very different way. They went on to

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
produce 85,000 designers, two and a half

179
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,199
leg engineers every year with high

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,080
quality. They moved into designled uh

181
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,120
businesses went into deep tech. They

182
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,880
laid that foundation of building a new

183
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,280
economy long time back. But how do they

184
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,639
do that? I think destroying the past.

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,560
Can you give me can you walk me through

186
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,520
that? China doesn't have a religion per

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,199
se as such. They don't live in the past.

188
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,199
Uh so we uh Indians we love to live in

189
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,720
the past. What do you mean by that and

190
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
how does it shape India's growth story?

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,599
I think past is our belief systems

192
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,319
culturally,

193
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,800
society, religion wise and I think our

194
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,560
society has been designed to be happy or

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,360
be contained.

196
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,639
it India is a age-old civilization and

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,319
our past continues in form of mythology,

198
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,400
in form of stories, in form of uh

199
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,880
whatever we do. I think our parents want

200
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,199
to teach us

201
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,599
uh what they believe was right and we

202
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,520
want to teach our children and maybe our

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,000
children will continue to tell the same

204
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,120
stories. These stories are not about

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,639
growth. These stories were not about

206
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,319
entrepreneurship. These stories were

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,560
about uh I think uh I think our

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,720
methodology and how do you think that

209
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,720
hampers India's economic growth story I

210
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,960
think we need new stories we need new

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,520
stories of entrepreneurship we need new

212
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,160
stories of growth we need new stories of

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,720
development new podcast basically

214
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,520
podcast are definitely a way I believe

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,840
uh when I discovered podcast I believe

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,120
it was like reading a book because all

217
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,320
our life we learned out of reading books

218
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,479
and Now podcast is like uh reading a

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,440
book very very imaginatively and much

220
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,919
much more faster I would say and maybe

221
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,919
sometimes it's quite deep also. Sir

222
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,399
earlier I I was a very emotional

223
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,800
optimist. I do not think logically. Now

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,320
I am a logical optimist because I try to

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,880
understand the constraints and strengths

226
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,080
of India and like I said our logistics

227
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
is moving slower than an active hour. We

228
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,600
have the biggest problem of all which is

229
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,839
land acquisition. So if you look at Bhat

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,519
Mala, we started with a budget of 5.35

231
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,680
lakh crores and now it is more than 10

232
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,399
lakh crores. I have a I have a view on

233
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,399
that. India is 18 to 19% of the world

234
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,959
population and our land mass is 3%. So

235
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,080
we'll always be short. Short of what? Of

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,480
of the of the land and we have to design

237
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
in a very different way. I don't know

238
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,680
what that design is. When you are a land

239
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,839
mass of only 3% of the planet, you have

240
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,120
to design it differently. Which means we

241
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,080
don't have the land mass of what China

242
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,680
has. You can't design what China did.

243
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,120
But we can definitely build highways. No

244
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,399
sir. But we have built decent

245
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,959
highways. Not that we have not built.

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,760
But is that decent good enough?

247
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
I think it's a very good

248
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,560
beginning. It's a very good beginning.

249
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,399
You cannot compare to China. China is

250
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,959
again 20% of the world's population. But

251
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,640
the land mass is much bigger. But sir,

252
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
how does land mass translate to growth?

253
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,519
Because if you look at India, no, we'll

254
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,519
be always be in short supply of land.

255
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,120
There always will be issues around land

256
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,800
but we have a land acquisition problem

257
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,839
fundamentally it will be issues around

258
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,160
land whatever that issues are but in in

259
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,920
in China because the state owns

260
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,279
everything they can just ask you to move

261
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,200
and build a road over there I think

262
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,880
that's a very romantic way of

263
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,680
storytelling they are all movie

264
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,920
storytelling type things but uh I think

265
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,399
we unique India has unique issues and

266
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,079
we'll have to find unique solutions okay

267
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
I think India was earlier a very

268
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,720
trustbased society correct And we are lo

269
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,480
we have lost that.

270
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,480
And because we that hampers business

271
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,160
that hampers growth.

272
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,640
Okay. So sir what is our way forward?

273
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,560
Let's tell better stories. But how are

274
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,279
we going to shape India's growth story?

275
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,399
I think we have a trust deficit

276
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,399
everywhere. The government has to trust

277
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,480
its citizens. Parents have to trust

278
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,480
their children. The society will have to

279
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,600
trust its members. All communities have

280
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,839
to create heroes. We have to I think

281
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,399
trust plays a very important role in

282
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,399
development of any society. Okay. And

283
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,680
how do you see India's consumer market

284
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,120
going? Because if you study India and in

285
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,200
fact you are the one who actually gifted

286
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
this terminology to the entire

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
entrepreneurship community, entrepreneur

288
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
community where you segregated India

289
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,600
into three categories. So first le I

290
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,000
want to hear it from you only. How would

291
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,160
you segregate India when it comes to

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,920
consumers and how do you think

293
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,959
entrepreneurs are supposed to use that

294
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,600
data to then build their business? I

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,320
think uh we wrote long time back maybe

296
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,920
18 20 years ago that India from

297
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,000
consumption lens can be seen into three

298
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,640
Indas that is India 1, India 2, India 3.

299
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,120
I still hold that theory now also. Okay.

300
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,760
India one is a consuming class. Anybody

301
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,160
who doesn't do some things at home with

302
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,800
his own hand is India one which is he

303
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,399
has some domestic help. India two is a

304
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,440
people who serve India one to lead a

305
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,839
better life. India 3 is the one who is

306
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,440
the struggling class the farm laborers

307
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,360
the daily wage earners. So everyone

308
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
every uh India consumes differently.

309
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,040
India one I call them as a consuming

310
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,760
class. So we went much deeper into India

311
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,519
1 now and we said India 1 has uh around

312
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,839
maybe what we call it's around 10% of

313
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,320
India 30 million households 30 million

314
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,519
households 12 cr people out of which we

315
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,000
broke down this 12 cr people into 50 to

316
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,000
60 lakh people which accounts for 15% of

317
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,600
our GDP is exactly like

318
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Singapore around 50 lakh people per

319
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,440
capita of Singapore kind of uh uh very

320
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,240
similar to Singapore and 15% of India's

321
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,639
GDP. Then we came down, we saw another 3

322
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,880
three and a half cr people exactly like

323
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,800
Poland. They also account for 15% of

324
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,720
India's

325
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,920
GDP and then came in another 8 and 1/2

326
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,000
cr people exactly like

327
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,959
Mexico and uh they accounted for 15% of

328
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,720
India's GDP. If you look at this top 30

329
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,639
million households, they account for

330
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,880
India's 45% of GDP. They account for 70%

331
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,079
of package goods consumption. They

332
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,399
account for 89% of beauty products. They

333
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,680
account for 50% of the clothing

334
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,120
market. Significant amount of

335
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,839
entertainment going about uh services.

336
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,160
This 10 top 10% accounts for nearly 50%

337
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,800
of India's consumption. So here's where

338
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,880
India's consumer story is. I think the

339
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,440
consumption uh story ends here because

340
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,200
the rest of India consumes nonvalue

341
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,959
added products. What do you mean by that

342
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,600
sir? I think value addition which they

343
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,519
do at home or they consume very number

344
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,320
of SKUs which they consume are very very

345
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,320
low. So the numbers are huge but the

346
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,880
value addition is lower. Value addition

347
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,360
means you have added some processing you

348
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
brand packaging design there is

349
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,639
something extra which has gone into it

350
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,920
and there is lot of economic activity

351
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,639
which happens for India to grow we have

352
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,200
to get into a value added economy. So

353
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,920
would a good analogy be purchasing rice

354
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,600
and purchasing biryani? I think the per

355
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,360
kilo the rice cost 40 rupees. The

356
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:06,399
biryani delivered at home through a

357
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,839
zomato will cost you close to 280 rupees

358
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,519
to 450 rupees a kilo. So biryani value

359
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,360
addition because there is a delivery

360
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,000
cost, there is a packaging cost, there

361
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,160
is a processing cost and then there is

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,760
the branding and the marketing cost. So

363
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,839
in that value addition lot of people

364
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,320
have entered in and lot of earnings have

365
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,839
happened. So the the story of 40 rupees

366
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,279
to 280 rupees is a seven times value

367
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,519
addition. Correct. So as far as my

368
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,959
podcast are

369
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,240
concerned, fortunately or unfortunately

370
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,839
I've been only I've been exposed to only

371
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,800
people who have built businesses for

372
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,720
India 1. So India 1 is more or less

373
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,639
clear to me and we'll seek a deeper

374
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,639
understanding of how to build for India

375
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,800
1 and then go towards India 2 and India

376
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,160
3 throughout this entire episode. And

377
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,000
then I want to come to the story of big

378
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,839
bazar and apply all these learnings and

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,920
frameworks to the story of big bazar to

380
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,000
then understand the rise and fall so

381
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,320
that we can take out lessons in such a

382
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,880
way that today when somebody's trying to

383
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,240
build a consumer brand in India they can

384
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,680
use these frameworks to then approach

385
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,000
the market. So what is the secret to

386
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,240
cracking India 1's market sour how do

387
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
you crack India one? If if today

388
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
somebody were to build a consumer brand,

389
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,800
how should they go from finding a gap in

390
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,199
the market to all the way taking the

391
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,600
product to the market and scaling up? I

392
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,639
think India one there are two segment of

393
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,160
India. One which is Singapore and

394
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,639
Poland. They have high discretionary

395
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,639
income. They are nearly I would say 3

396
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,519
and a half to 4 cr of population. They

397
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:39,040
reside I would say in many corners of

398
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,880
India and they have enough money to

399
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,600
consume.

400
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,920
Now it's for a marketeer or a brand

401
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,880
developer or a product or a category

402
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,680
creator to see what are the gaps what

403
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,440
are the gap you can forcibly create into

404
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,160
the minds or the neuro imaging of that

405
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,519
people the consumers and they are

406
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,920
willing to change they are willing to

407
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,120
experiment sir what is the consumer

408
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,800
behavior difference

409
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,360
between the Singapore consumers Poland

410
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,360
consumers and Mexico consumers a lot can

411
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,880
you point out some differentiators. If

412
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,440
you look at the consumption of Mexico,

413
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,920
they are they have a problem of paying

414
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,000
emis or some loans which Singapore and

415
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,560
Poland doesn't have.

416
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,480
Can you expand on that sir? So I would

417
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,240
say Mexico consumer would have a house

418
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,399
loan or a car loan or some EMIs to pay.

419
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,800
So his consumption his aspirations arise

420
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,680
equal to a Poland

421
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:40,800
aspiration but uh his ability to get

422
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,199
into that fold of consumption on a

423
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,360
regular basis is still restricted. So

424
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,880
you can sell the Mexican consumers a

425
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,639
house, a car and insurance plus lot of

426
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,079
categories they consume. Which are the

427
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,759
top three four categories that you think

428
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,839
we can sell to Mexico? Clothing,

429
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,040
beauty, home delivery, food. Yeah mother

430
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,560
I think they are they are

431
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,199
experimentative and they are learning to

432
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,039
consume everything. Got it. But would

433
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480
clothing still be restricted to brands

434
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,480
like but then the price point changes

435
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,959
there. Yeah. So would you call them

436
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
would would you say that Mexico if you

437
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,160
were to understand them in the context

438
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
of the clothing market. Do you think

439
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,079
they would restrict themselves only to

440
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,760
Zudo and Westside and not go beyond?

441
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,360
They might experiment with many brands.

442
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,679
I think Zudo is also a very interesting

443
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,079
thing because today Mexico is a very

444
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,079
instadriven society.

445
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,919
Once you see a particular clothes with a

446
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,240
particular image of yours which you have

447
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,120
posted, you want to see you want you

448
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,640
don't want to post that again on another

449
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,440
day. So the frequency of changing for

450
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,880
that customer so the price point changes

451
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,840
because if you have to change so fast

452
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,880
you can't afford to pay more and I think

453
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,480
zodia fulfilled that need. So wherever

454
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,200
their needs will get fulfilled they are

455
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
going to go there. Got it. Now let's

456
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
move to Poland. What is the stark

457
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,400
differentiation between Mexico and

458
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,039
Poland consumers? I think they're

459
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,039
comfortable in

460
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,919
finance. They are comfortable in basic

461
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,840
uh housing,

462
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,280
clothing,

463
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,000
shelter, I think business. They have

464
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,120
created wealth for one or two

465
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,679
generations. So they are much much more

466
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,200
secured. And how does that result into a

467
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,960
behavioral shift? The decision making

468
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,160
shift because they are much much more

469
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,000
secured. They don't have loans to pay

470
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
and uh I think they behave very

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
differently. They are they are they have

472
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,400
a discretionary income. They are

473
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,840
experimenting with a lot of new

474
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,160
categories. They are going abroad. They

475
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,480
are shopping there. It's very very

476
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
different. Got it. And if an

477
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,880
entrepreneur has to sell to Mexico

478
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,120
versus they selling to Poland, how do

479
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,360
you think their approach should change?

480
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,760
I think Mexico the number the audience

481
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,120
is a little larger. They will be very

482
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,440
very value and price conscious and uh

483
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,960
they are still

484
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,240
aspirational and they want to be part of

485
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,520
the mainstream of the society and uh

486
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,440
they are as modern consumers of content

487
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:05,200
as what Poland would be and uh they are

488
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,919
wanting to be part of everything new

489
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,000
happening in the society culturally or

490
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,320
anything else.

491
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,720
Got it. So if an entrepreneur has to

492
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,000
sell to

493
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Mexico, the entrepreneur will have to

494
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,120
assume that they are aspirational but

495
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,919
they are price conscious. But when they

496
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,679
sell to a Mexico, they can just merely

497
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,280
focus on perceived value. I would say

498
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,919
Mexico is price conscious, not Poland

499
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,520
people. Oh, sorry. Mexico is price

500
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,160
conscious and Poland is not price and

501
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,919
value conscious. Both Poland is not so

502
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
conscious. They are conscious but not so

503
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,240
conscious as much as what Mexico is. Got

504
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,480
it. So if I were to understand this in

505
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,600
the context of the clothing brands

506
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
because that's something that everybody

507
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,360
can use as a head stick, Mexico would be

508
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,360
Zudo, Poland would be Zara and Singapore

509
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,240
Westside also. Okay. And Singapore would

510
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,880
be Singapore is is very different. It is

511
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
quite luxury or

512
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,039
it's premium and luxury brand. And if

513
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,720
you

514
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:04,880
name just to give you a perspective,

515
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,400
there is a Hermes store in Kalagura. MS

516
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,360
is the biggest luxury brand of the

517
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,799
world. When I took some data from there,

518
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,120
60 people 60 Bombay people or Indian

519
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,160
people account for 80% of their business

520
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,280
and it it is among the few top ranking

521
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,720
stores of Hermes. So just to give you

522
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,679
just to give the audience more context,

523
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,960
how much does an Hermes bag cost?

524
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,960
I would say nothing less than five

525
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,200
lakhs. Nothing as a starting point.

526
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,600
Okay. And there they are able to sell to

527
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,760
60 customers. 60 customers account for

528
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,559
close to 80% of the business. So do they

529
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,440
get repeat sales? Yeah. Yeah. It's

530
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,600
crazy. But Singapore is very different

531
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,320
that audience there. That is that 50

532
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
lakh people. You can name them.

533
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,120
Got it. Get them into your podcast also.

534
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,720
You're one of them sir. I'm not there.

535
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,240
You are one of them sir. So I would

536
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,320
place you even above Singapore. You are

537
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,600
probably I'm not there.

538
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,400
Maybe I have not been able to shop from

539
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,919
her yet. Anyway, that is because you do

540
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
not want to. Anyway, I don't think so.

541
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,120
Anyway, that's a separate story. Okay,

542
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,919
sir. Now, help me

543
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,360
understand what should be an

544
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,280
entrepreneur's approach to selling to

545
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,880
Singapore because here you have very

546
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,120
high disposable income. I think people

547
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,039
are uh people are there also the

548
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,200
community is bored of all this uh

549
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,320
premium and luxury brands. They want

550
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,240
quiet luxury now. Quiet luxury. Luxury

551
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,640
which is not visible. Luxury which

552
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,360
pleases themselves. So long story short,

553
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,440
we have to do value addition in order to

554
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,440
sell to India 1. Whether that's Mexico,

555
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,280
Poland or Singapore, it doesn't matter.

556
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,600
Now sir, how do you go about doing this

557
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,760
value addition? Can you break this down?

558
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,919
Value addition, what I mean by value

559
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,200
addition is when you look at the raw

560
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,240
material and the source raw material

561
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,640
price to the finished product, there's a

562
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,440
multiple X difference. So there's an

563
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,760
opportunity for everybody to play in

564
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,280
that. Whether it's the processing,

565
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,600
whether it's the branding, whether it's

566
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,120
the packaging, whether it's the design.

567
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,760
So too many players get involved and

568
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,640
value addition creates

569
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,480
economies. If you look at the most

570
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
advanced economies of the world, there

571
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,039
would be lot of value added economy. If

572
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
you look at China now, China is moving

573
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,320
into value addition in a very

574
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,320
significant way. So

575
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,600
ultimately just to give you a

576
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,360
perspective

577
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:27,520
biscuits would start from 120 rupees a

578
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,679
kilo to 500 rupees a kilo. But once you

579
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,919
move to

580
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,840
cookies and uh international biscuits we

581
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,400
will move from 400 rupees a kilo to

582
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,200
2,000 a kilo. Chocolate starts from

583
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,960
let's say barasur a kilo. But the price

584
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,559
of raw material in India or anywhere in

585
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,000
the world won't be more than 80 90

586
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,720
rupees. I would say in India at least in

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,760
Indian context raw material use but it's

588
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,320
the value addition is what uh gets the

589
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,120
economy driven in a way the value

590
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,600
addition in a economy is something which

591
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,360
I think Indians are now getting there

592
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,120
and value added products can be consumed

593
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,080
by India one significantly

594
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,600
correct and where do you think the

595
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,440
biggest opportunity lies in this value

596
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:13,000
addiction chain sir I think

597
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:18,400
food lifestyle goods

598
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,200
M recreation, sports, entertainment.

599
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,240
So now let's move to India

600
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:27,039
2. Can you define India 2 first? India 2

601
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,559
is basically a kind of a service economy

602
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,320
which is helping India one to lead a

603
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,559
better life and what would their per

604
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,880
capita income be?

605
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,880
I don't I think it's it depends on the

606
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,840
family size and how many members of the

607
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,360
family working. What we are seeing is a

608
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,480
significant change from when we started

609
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,360
this theory to now that the India to

610
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,919
next generation is wanting to come into

611
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,039
the mainstream and are more aspirational

612
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,640
and don't want to do what their parents

613
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,320
do. So India too I will call the people

614
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,559
who make our life better. The driver,

615
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,200
the helper, the pune, the maids, the

616
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:06,799
domestic help, watchmen, pune, lift men.

617
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
So it's a it's a huge community.

618
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,320
the the doies mother. It's a community

619
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,080
which makes our life better and it's

620
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,320
significant amount of India. Would you

621
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,760
place them between $3,000 to $5,000 of

622
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,720
per capita income?

623
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,320
I I think depends in urban centers it'll

624
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,840
be different in other centers it'll be

625
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,000
different and depending on the again at

626
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,279
the family size if the member of uh the

627
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,360
parents both are working and the

628
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,640
children is working children may be a

629
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,640
part of the gig economy in a way.

630
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,200
Now so we are seeing change of

631
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,240
consumption pattern there also. Got it.

632
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,360
And what exactly makes them buy? You

633
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,520
said aspiration but then we placed zudo

634
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,760
for Mexico. So either we we are seeing

635
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,720
zudo or even attracting India too. India

636
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,480
too. India to next generation. Okay. So

637
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
what is the playbook to cracking India

638
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,679
too?

639
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,279
I think urban centers India 2 you can

640
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,559
easily capture because they have similar

641
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,360
aspirations because they are serving

642
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,559
India one and they are seeing that

643
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,159
lifestyle. So they want to ape that

644
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,600
lifestyle. We I see a lot of beauty

645
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,279
products happening. If you look at uh

646
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,520
the story of uh purple also there are

647
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,760
some brands which are catering to India

648
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,520
to audience. I would say demart has been

649
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,520
created with India to audience

650
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
significantly.

651
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,799
So there are brands which has been

652
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,440
working. They are very value seekers.

653
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,520
They are not value added consumers. They

654
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,000
consume commodities more than I would

655
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,400
say processed

656
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,400
food. And uh they are experimenting with

657
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,559
uh lot of things which are happening in

658
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
terms of consumption. Got it. And three

659
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,559
of the biggest consumption trends that

660
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,440
you would place for India too would

661
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:51,200
beauty is one. I'm very uh beauty and

662
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,320
some lifestyle goods at lower price

663
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,559
points. uh for example lifestyle goods

664
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,600
are uh I would say they are also taking

665
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,320
holidays now recreation they are their

666
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,320
entertainment content consumption is

667
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,320
different they don't pay so much of

668
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,240
money to that so they will consume a lot

669
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:13,600
of free content in a way and uh I would

670
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,400
and clothing also I think they are now

671
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,679
getting into much much more

672
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,679
modern style

673
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,600
clothing these are the trends

674
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
Got it. Now sir, how do you sell to

675
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,600
India 3? Because I've often heard about

676
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,799
this term called finding fortune at the

677
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,960
bottom of the pyramid. I think that's a

678
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,640
I think that's a story which caught

679
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,559
attention but it has no meaning in terms

680
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,159
of commerce. I'm I'm not a great

681
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,120
believer of that story at all because

682
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:45,600
India 3 I just to give you a perspective

683
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,679
India 1 consumes maybe 100,000 items in

684
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,760
their lifetime.

685
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,520
India too consumes maybe now they are

686
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,799
consuming much more but earlier when we

687
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
were looking at this theory it was

688
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,120
10,000 items in their lifetime in their

689
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,840
lifetime means one item one pencil

690
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,640
eraser

691
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:06,600
item India 3 consumes not more than

692
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,600
thousand items in their lifetime

693
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,240
they are very basic consumers can any

694
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,039
large brand be built for India 3 you can

695
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,440
build a a Hawai chapel kind of a brand

696
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,600
like relaxo I wouldn't know the

697
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,760
I doubt whether they'll buy Rexo also

698
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,240
all of them.

699
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,880
So they are quite a lot into the re

700
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,840
processed reusable market plus low price

701
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,720
point. They consume commodities. They

702
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,799
are fed by the government to a certain

703
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,880
extent. It's a different consumer. So

704
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,279
you don't think any large brand can be

705
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,760
built for India 3?

706
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,240
I can't build it or I can't imagine but

707
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,240
there might be some products there are

708
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,000
there are some clothing brands which are

709
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,080
fabricdriven.

710
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,640
consumption value

711
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,440
added but that is that time of the year

712
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,240
where they gift a little bit and

713
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,720
weddings is a where their consumption

714
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,960
happen they would buy gold at that time

715
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,240
they might buy clothing at that time so

716
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,080
you're saying that only once in a

717
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:16,559
lifetime consumption during weddings

718
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,559
events religious

719
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:25,120
basis But otherwise it's a very basic

720
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,960
conception. M got it understood sir. So

721
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,440
now let's come to your story. Now that

722
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,440
we've defined India very well. I want to

723
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,000
understand what is your story. How did

724
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,520
you go from being an ordinary person to

725
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,600
becoming one of the most celebrated

726
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,039
entrepreneurs in the country? Because

727
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,480
I've been reading your growth story. You

728
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,000
started from pantaloons then moved to

729
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,360
big bazar and then you did a bunch of

730
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,679
things. In fact, when my team started

731
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,240
doing research about your achievements

732
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,520
and your

733
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,039
benchmarks, sir, we got 60 pages of

734
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,720
research. So, we realized that it's just

735
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,919
better to learn it from you rather than

736
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,799
going deep into it because you'll be

737
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,240
able to throw light on the most

738
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,960
important checkpoints and benchmarks and

739
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,880
achievements that you have um you have

740
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,720
gained over time. So, I want to

741
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,799
understand how did Kishor Byani become

742
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,480
Kishor Byani. Let's start with one

743
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,919
profound memory of your childhood which

744
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,919
shaped you into the person you are

745
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,919
because we believe in fact from all the

746
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,000
podcasts we've done we've realized that

747
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,399
every person is actually shaped by some

748
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,720
profound childhood memories which turns

749
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,840
them into the person that they are. So

750
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,559
what made Kishor Byani the person that

751
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,039
he is today?

752
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,279
I I

753
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:32,960
I remember two memories which may might

754
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,360
have helped me in shaping in the

755
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,679
consumption story which I participated.

756
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,240
One was outside Malachmi temple there

757
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,640
are a lot of uh stalls which comes about

758
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,279
selling toys and other things. So as a

759
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,520
market or a heart I have when I look at

760
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,960
it there are memories around that and

761
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,720
there is a memory around there was a

762
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,559
departmental store called century bazar

763
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,279
at uh prabadevi I've been there once or

764
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,559
twice. So I think maybe there are some

765
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,559
memories of that

766
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,320
store. Maybe that would have shaped or

767
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,919
that would have maybe whenever I'm

768
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,880
imagining something in consumption that

769
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,640
might be at my some vivid memory on

770
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,320
that. Yeah. Some some visualization

771
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,520
around that. Yeah. Sir, we were

772
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,480
listening to your we were actually

773
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,440
studying your story and we learned that

774
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,240
you actually went completely bullish on

775
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,760
denim jeans. So how did you start? How

776
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,039
did you become an entrepreneur in the

777
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,679
first place?

778
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:32,200
So my uh family was in clothing business

779
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:36,799
and they were traders of

780
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:39,840
textiles and uh I think I have memories

781
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,559
of being to the Ghi or to the Mulji

782
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,320
Jetta market where we had a shop and

783
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,880
dealing with fabric. I did a course in

784
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,240
weaving also in Sasmir. In weaving.

785
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,919
Yeah. Okay.

786
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,600
uh my first business was to put up a

787
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,559
weaving unit and a brand for supplying

788
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,440
to the garment industry fabrics. Then I

789
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,840
became the soul selling distributor for

790
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,360
denim when mill started denim in India.

791
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,120
So I got exposed to the readymade

792
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,480
industry. Then I thought uh seeing the

793
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,399
readym made industry I said there's a

794
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,080
gap of nobody has a trouser brand in the

795
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,720
country. So that's why panthaloons came

796
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,760
about as a trouser brand. I put up a

797
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,679
factory to make trousers.

798
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,840
And parallelly I started a yarn

799
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,679
business to make some what do you call

800
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,159
innovative yarns to make good fabrics

801
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,279
which is differentiated. So my career

802
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,919
started from there. So some

803
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,320
manufacturing some branding some dealing

804
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,760
with the clothing industry to understand

805
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,200
how India should we are a product of

806
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,200
liberalization and there were many many

807
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,279
things happening at that point of time.

808
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,440
I think this would be around '90s, early

809
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:50,240
'90s. And I think '90s gave you a lot of

810
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,240
opportunity because India was in a

811
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,919
liberalization mode. A lot of new things

812
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,600
were happening. We were getting exposed

813
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,760
to marketing, advertising. That subject

814
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,320
fascinated me. I was a student of

815
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,679
advertising in a way. Used to observe

816
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,000
every ads, every brand being made and

817
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,840
that made me interested. So that's I

818
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
think was my early imagination of

819
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,080
business.

820
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,159
Sir, I have one request. You just

821
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,000
putting out things so casually. You just

822
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,840
said but sir that's a big deal like tell

823
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,279
me deeper into you know ignorance was a

824
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,640
bless. Okay. What do you

825
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:28,880
mean we didn't go to a management school

826
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
in a way I got exposed to I did my

827
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,000
commerce I did a little bit of

828
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,240
postgraduation I did sashmir I did my

829
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,600
chartered accountancy I was a generalist

830
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,200
I didn't want to be a specialist in

831
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,200
anything. Okay. I think

832
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,960
maybe 11th I had not moved out of a

833
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,960
particular

834
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:55,279
locality. It was experimentative life.

835
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,919
Life was all about meeting people,

836
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,919
learning every day.

837
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,519
Did you always want to do a

838
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,039
business? I was very rebellious. I would

839
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,360
say why? I don't know why because I

840
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,679
didn't believe maybe I was using

841
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,960
rationality too much. I wanted to

842
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,840
question everything which was happening

843
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,760
at that point of time whether it was

844
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,320
some religious rituals or why do people

845
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,480
do a particular thing. So questioning

846
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,600
ability to that's a problem in a way and

847
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,840
that's a blessing also in a way. Okay.

848
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,519
So how did you spot the first gap in the

849
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,799
market when you actually set up a

850
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,640
factory to manufacture trousers and you

851
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,640
built a brand and and then you built a

852
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,480
brand around it? How did you spot that

853
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,840
gap and how did you put a finger to it

854
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,240
and say I'm going to go bullish on this?

855
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,600
So when I went uh when I was uh when I

856
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,960
made my fabric uh when I first looms

857
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,600
fabric to I used to make innovative

858
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,840
fabric and consumption garment

859
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,399
indry I got exposed to government

860
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,320
industry then denim as a fabric to

861
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,560
supply to all that that is again bottom

862
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,639
I again got exposed to dealing with

863
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,159
whatever is happening in the market and

864
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,440
market I thought why will people not

865
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,440
wear readymade in the long term

866
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,119
basis I started a brand called pantaloon

867
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,159
at that point of time. Yeah. So

868
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,919
pantaloon was born as an idea to

869
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,079
organize the unorganized market of

870
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,159
denims and trousers.

871
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,000
That time it was more trousers and not

872
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,119
denim as much. Denim k we started a

873
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,159
brand called bear. Bear bear became a

874
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,399
big brand.

875
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,480
What is the difference between 1980s and

876
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,200
1990s? I think I don't remember much of

877
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,000
80s because that was uh the very early

878
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,359
days of learning I would say '90s was

879
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,920
the age where we started executing

880
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,520
and lot of experimentation we did okay

881
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,760
for example

882
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,160
I think 80s may we started uh I must

883
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,320
have started a yarn business making

884
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,760
yarns I had a fabric business making

885
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,440
fabrics for the government industry I

886
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,839
must have went into distribution of

887
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,560
denim fabric to the government industry

888
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,440
I think '90s may I moved into my own

889
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,599
brands which is panthaloon bear John

890
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,119
Miller then opening our own stores

891
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,960
called pentaloon shop then the large

892
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,200
store panthaloons in gyat which is a

893
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,160
family store then into multiple things

894
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,200
which is I would say more formats on

895
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,640
retail called central brand factory big

896
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,480
bajar hometown ezone then moved into the

897
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,800
consumption we thought uh we should get

898
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,160
into the consumption of Indian consumers

899
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:52,160
we went into gyms salons loans a lot of

900
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,000
joint ventures which we did we went into

901
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,920
then we thought we should finance them

902
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,680
to make them show up more. So we opened

903
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,560
our

904
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:03,240
NBFC we created our own uh funds also we

905
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:08,480
had a private equity fund a real estate

906
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:11,680
fund then we had uh we we acquired lot

907
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,079
of businesses through that. Then we did

908
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,280
insurance as a business. We opened our

909
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,359
own logistic company uh which was one of

910
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,400
the larger ones very modern. So it it's

911
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,400
it was an eventful journey of doing

912
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,200
multiple things too early too

913
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,119
fast and compounding growth which was

914
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,880
crazy.

915
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,440
But sir, how did you dabble into so many

916
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,240
things? I

917
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,800
think

918
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,960
logistics we had to do on our own and

919
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,400
maybe we were ideas person. We thought

920
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,040
ideas we can fractify 0 to1. I think we

921
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,680
did so many projects 0 to1 which is when

922
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,400
I look back it looks so stupid and so

923
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,040
many and so much that sometimes it

924
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,200
surprises us how much we did. Do you

925
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,480
think you spread yourself too thin?

926
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,760
These are all management words. Uh in

927
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,680
hindsight one can say that because uh

928
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,160
you should have a great cash flow

929
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,160
business to experiment a lot. Maybe we

930
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,079
didn't have

931
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,200
that and we were growing on debt more.

932
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,079
So in hindsight yes but whatever we

933
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,160
created were good

934
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,079
products, interesting business models.

935
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,400
In hindsight again I say that we could

936
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,800
have optimized everything to a level

937
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,040
which should have been very very

938
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,480
interesting for anyone. If you were to

939
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,920
go back in time how do you think you

940
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,520
would have done things differently? I

941
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,040
would have been I would have hired

942
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,839
somebody who could have been a great

943
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,760
optimizer of whatever I'm creating as in

944
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,680
for every vertical. Every vertical. So

945
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,359
back then did you head all verticals?

946
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,920
Not head. We had CEOs running it but

947
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,520
optimizing is a very specialized thing.

948
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,680
How to take out juice out of everything

949
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,160
which you have created. Can you walk me

950
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,160
deeper into it? So like if you look at

951
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,960
Big Badar as a business model, it was a

952
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,760
26% gross margin

953
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,160
model. If you look at the other

954
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,680
retailers, they are at 18 19%. So we

955
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,200
were maybe 50% more than anybody else.

956
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,000
And how do you optimize and make money

957
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,680
out of that? The margins were there.

958
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,280
Central as a business model was probably

959
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,520
the best business model which we

960
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,800
created. It uh some of the storage

961
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,280
abitas were in excess of 20 to 25%. But

962
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,040
how did you have such high margins? We

963
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,839
because we built our own products, our

964
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,960
own brands. We had scale and we unders I

965
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,119
think we introduced a lot of new

966
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,920
categories in the market. Okay. So let's

967
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,720
go from pantaloons to central to big

968
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,000
bizarre. So pantaloons was a

969
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,599
trouser. Pantaloon was a trouser brand.

970
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
No, pantaloon was trouser and men's wear

971
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,640
to start with a very early days small

972
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,320
shops but then we moved into the large

973
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,920
format of retail. So it was a multibrand

974
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,000
outlet. It was a multibrand family

975
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,560
outlet always right from the beginning.

976
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,839
Yeah. Okay. Then from pantaloons what

977
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,680
exactly were the learnings that you

978
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,839
acquired which then helped you to level

979
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,320
up? I think understanding the clothing

980
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,240
business for every age group of the

981
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,680
family. But how did you how did you

982
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,680
understand clothing? Because today we

983
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,200
have access to a lot of data but back

984
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,520
then I think we were I was a fabric

985
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,760
person. I understood yarn and I

986
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,280
understood uh what kind of garment I

987
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,480
went into garment manufacturing myself.

988
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,400
we were in that value chain which I went

989
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,079
through that journey. So to understand

990
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,359
that was quite okay and then we had to

991
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,280
understand the consumers and the

992
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,800
changing behavior and the changing

993
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,119
society in that sense. We started

994
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,240
understanding that we started understand

995
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,079
how to build brands, how to create uh a

996
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,680
brand persona and how to attract

997
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,280
consumers. I think we started learning

998
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,920
that and that gave us that confidence

999
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:46,800
that uh you can build and service people

1000
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,440
and build a business. So walk me through

1001
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,119
how to build a brand. Let's take let's

1002
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,680
understand your approach and then apply

1003
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,960
this to the modern context. How did you

1004
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,880
fundamentally build a brand? What are

1005
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,520
the I think brand is brand is uh the

1006
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,800
personality of a

1007
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,720
product which you can make somebody

1008
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,040
aspire to have or some features or some

1009
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,640
it has to reflect your persona also in a

1010
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,280
certain way so that you get attracted to

1011
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,119
it. So how do you understand your target

1012
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,440
market? How you understand that persona?

1013
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,520
How do you build that into that brand

1014
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,920
and how do you appeal to the people so

1015
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,320
that the ultimately a commerce happens.

1016
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,000
So brand persona has to resonate with

1017
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,839
customer persona which eventually

1018
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,839
results into resonance. Absolutely. And

1019
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,839
that builds a brand. Totally. Walk me

1020
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,920
through how should a brand understand

1021
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,160
their persona and then strike resonance

1022
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,079
with a customer. I think if you look at

1023
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,240
any brand it will talk about it. Take

1024
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,200
any brand and I can explain you. Let's

1025
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,440
talk about Levis. Yeah. So Levis is a

1026
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,320
brand which was built on a heritage of

1027
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,760
why denim jeans were worn by miners. how

1028
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,400
they created that fire pocket. There is

1029
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,720
a myth and story around how genes were

1030
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,240
constructed and they transmitted that

1031
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,720
story to the consumers and people

1032
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,640
started relating to that stories. The

1033
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,319
stories of uh Levice is a very

1034
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,880
interesting brand. The levice is one

1035
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,480
brand which never started from the top.

1036
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,319
What do you mean sir? Most of the brands

1037
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,560
are created very aspirational which

1038
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,560
starts from the upper echelons of the

1039
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,640
society. They wear it and then that

1040
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,640
style comes down. Correct. Denim was a

1041
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,800
style which came from the bottom of the

1042
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,480
society and it went up. It started on

1043
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,960
California gold rush. No. Yeah. So it

1044
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,359
started from workers or the miners at

1045
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,560
that point of time to going up to the

1046
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,800
highest level. So it's a very

1047
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,640
interesting case study of how a brand

1048
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,760
was built out of story of that time in a

1049
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,640
different way. And what is Levis India

1050
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,599
story? I think they they hopped on the

1051
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,839
imagery of the the original brand. Levis

1052
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,839
is a Levis was a synonym to a jeans and

1053
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,520
they played that story. Levis coming to

1054
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,480
India, jeans coming to India. They are

1055
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,680
the OG's of jeans and uh if you don't

1056
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,839
have a Levis pair in your wardrobe then

1057
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,440
you're not having any jeans. I think

1058
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,520
that was a position. Got it. So let's

1059
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,560
talk about how to break down Levis's

1060
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,280
brand persona and then study how they

1061
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,640
struck a resonance with their customers.

1062
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,119
How would you do that sir? So every

1063
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,520
modern

1064
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:21,760
consumers has to have a wardrobe or and

1065
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,079
that wardrobe has to comprise of a jeans

1066
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,760
and that genes has to be alise. But how

1067
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,359
do you make it mandatory? It's not

1068
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,800
mandatory. It's a psycho. It's a neuro

1069
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,319
image which you create in the mind of

1070
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,240
the consumer. And how do you create that

1071
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,440
neuro image? Through communication.

1072
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,040
Through whatever messaging you are

1073
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,560
doing. And how do you craft that

1074
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,319
messaging on what basis? That is what

1075
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,920
advertising is all about. That is what

1076
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,000
communication is all about. Walk me

1077
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,560
through this mur. How do you go about

1078
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,160
identifying a customer then crafting the

1079
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,920
messaging and then building your brand

1080
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,520
to strike resonance? So we have done it

1081
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,000
in all our brands. If you look at bear

1082
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,319
which was our denim brand we had uh we

1083
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,119
had built an image about bear as a very

1084
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,760
rebellious

1085
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:02,560
thing and uh and we we discovered that

1086
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,720
uh at the time in '90s when we were

1087
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,760
growing up we were not born to

1088
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,440
democratic parents. We had uh a parents

1089
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,000
which uh didn't want us to consume

1090
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,160
anything. Don't didn't want to try us

1091
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,720
make us try any new things. So we had to

1092
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,040
rebel. So that time the rebellion was

1093
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,040
quite a lot and we played on that thing

1094
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,640
about rebelliousness in the brand that

1095
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,079
time when we were building it.

1096
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,839
Beautiful. So you're saying that you

1097
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,160
have to first understand the story of

1098
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,359
your customers. When you understand the

1099
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,119
story of your customers, you'll be able

1100
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,040
to spot a sentiment that you can bank

1101
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,880
your brand on. In your case, it was

1102
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,880
rebellion. And then how did you craft

1103
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,200
your message for bear? I think that kind

1104
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,880
of whatever imagery we were creating was

1105
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,760
on that rebelliousness that time. For

1106
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,599
example,

1107
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,800
I I cannot uh there was something one of

1108
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,920
the ads uh got uh into trouble also.

1109
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,599
Okay. And uh we that time I think there

1110
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,800
was that Sanjayat uh thing he was a

1111
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,040
rebel of a very different kind. We we

1112
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,040
used that story in a very indirect form.

1113
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,880
Okay. to show revelation I there's some

1114
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,319
faint memories of uh what we did let's

1115
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,359
understand this using a modern example

1116
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,760
no sir you tell me any I think we do

1117
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,480
this uh day in day out I we would have

1118
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,480
built 120 brands till now so we have a

1119
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,640
whole theory of building a brand through

1120
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,280
a brand hopstead a brand star we have

1121
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,599
our own method I believe making a brand

1122
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,400
is like making a spaceship it has so

1123
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,920
many components it has to we have we

1124
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,599
create rituals around the brand we

1125
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,240
create role models around on the brand.

1126
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,920
We create symbols around the brands. We

1127
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,319
have a brand star which we make. Uh we

1128
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,240
look at the societal truth. We look at

1129
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,920
the competitive insights. So we do a lot

1130
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,040
of things around building a brand. Sir,

1131
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,280
this is beautiful. I want to go

1132
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,800
extremely deep into it. So walk me

1133
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,560
through the step-by-step process because

1134
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,640
you've said too many things and I want

1135
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,599
to almost break it down like a framework

1136
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,599
in a step-by-step process. So we want to

1137
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,599
build a brand. Let's say we want to

1138
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,680
build a skincare brand today. So I think

1139
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,760
the latest brand which I have helped as

1140
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,839
a mentor to a particular brand was a

1141
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,720
brand called Superu. Superu. Let's talk

1142
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:15,119
about Superu. Superu is a brand uh build

1143
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:16,720
on protein as a story and uh fortunately

1144
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,240
the entrepreneur in this brand is a

1145
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,960
nephew of mine and uh he and Ranir Singh

1146
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,440
co-created this brand. So when we look

1147
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,760
at Ranir as a personality, we thought uh

1148
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,480
there is no better personality to build

1149
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,520
a brand on protein like Ranir Singh

1150
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,240
because he exudes energy and protein in

1151
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,520
a way is all about energy and while

1152
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,119
conceptualizing the brand we saw the

1153
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,200
insight that if you create a brand with

1154
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,640
energy there is a great chance of being

1155
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,640
successful. So the brand was thought

1156
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,599
about in a way that any product which

1157
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,079
can makes you super youu you become much

1158
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,079
much better than yourself and that's

1159
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,040
what

1160
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:01,119
uh the star reflected the

1161
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,040
co-founder got it and we we looked at

1162
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,000
the personality of the co-founder and

1163
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,480
put that into the brand fully in

1164
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,480
whatever communication we do to whatever

1165
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,960
is doing and lovely and the best thing

1166
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,280
is the co-founder believes in it. He

1167
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,040
gets involved in the product. He looks

1168
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,880
at the product from a angle which no

1169
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,520
other co-founder must have ever done.

1170
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,960
For example, like making a product like

1171
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,560
we are just launching a new product

1172
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,800
which is just about to be launched

1173
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,880
called protein chips. I think his

1174
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,440
involvement in developing the product

1175
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,920
the taste factor to agreeing to the

1176
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,760
packaging to the communication to the

1177
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,839
style I think this kind of involvement

1178
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,240
is not

1179
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:42,560
seen and the brand exudes the

1180
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,040
personality of the co-founder.

1181
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,960
So before building superu what was your

1182
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,599
approach to understand okay we can build

1183
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,119
a product like superu I think we saw

1184
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,800
there is a gap in the market on the

1185
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,440
protein side and there is a brand to be

1186
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,960
built that gap people want to consume

1187
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,560
protein we are a protein deficient

1188
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,040
country there are people who are now

1189
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,960
exposed to the what do you call the

1190
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,480
world they are part of the gyming world

1191
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,079
they are part of the physical training

1192
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,079
world exercise world wherein protein is

1193
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,760
a very important component and then

1194
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,760
India is protein deficient as we know

1195
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,240
because our food habits are much it's

1196
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,760
much more different. So there was a need

1197
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,680
the younger generation don't want to

1198
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,680
consume the protein in the way the

1199
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,079
parents consume. They want to consume in

1200
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,160
a newer way. And our idea was to build a

1201
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,760
newer way of consumption of protein. We

1202
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:30,240
brought it in in wafer biscuits. Uh we

1203
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,520
brought it in now in chips. We are going

1204
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:37,599
to bring it in the the what do you call

1205
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,280
the powder form of uh we are calling it

1206
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,599
yeast protein. a new technology through

1207
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,960
which uh Nikuni is building it up.

1208
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:48,839
So there's the idea of a gap build a

1209
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,599
brand create the product create the

1210
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:52,880
communication and launch it. It has been

1211
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:57,160
probably one of the most successful

1212
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:00,240
launches uh in the FMCT business till

1213
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:03,200
date and uh I think they have achieved

1214
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,520
in 5 months with one single product with

1215
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,960
only four SKUs or now five SKUs they

1216
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,880
have achieved close to 100 cr annual run

1217
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,359
rate which is unheard of in 5 months.

1218
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,440
True. So uh when it comes to brand

1219
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,760
communication there are two sides to it.

1220
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,400
One is what exactly you ideated and how

1221
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,960
it got executed. Now walk me through how

1222
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,319
did you design the communication? You

1223
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,319
had a co-founder. You how did you pick

1224
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,240
Ranir Singh by the way? I think Nikunj

1225
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,079
and Ranir they knew each other. So they

1226
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,960
they have been working on toying up on

1227
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,960
the idea of uh I we came in as a mentor

1228
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,040
to help them not to make any mistakes in

1229
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,079
their journey of entrepreneurship. Okay.

1230
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,280
And uh I think that's what we did

1231
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,240
because we we come from the consumer

1232
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,839
side understanding and the brand

1233
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,119
understanding. Nikon and Ramir were

1234
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:54,480
working on the product side and I think

1235
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:57,680
I think as a mentor and uh to Nikon I

1236
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,640
think it became very interesting that uh

1237
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:03,319
he exudes energy and I come from the

1238
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,640
wisdom side. So this wisdom energy

1239
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:08,319
combination worked very well. Got it.

1240
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,839
Now how did you design the communication

1241
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:14,480
for superu? I think my brief to Nikon

1242
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,720
was only very simple. see that uh there

1243
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,079
is energy in whatever content you are

1244
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,839
creating. Secondly, every content show

1245
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,119
uh somebody having this product and

1246
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,480
enjoying it because that is the

1247
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,119
neuroiming you'll have to keep on

1248
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:30,000
building it up as an enjoyable protein

1249
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,800
product. You have to love consuming it.

1250
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,440
Just show that images. My only two brief

1251
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,359
was this nothing else. And could you

1252
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,359
walk me deeper into it? What do other

1253
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,760
protein brands do wrong? I don't know. I

1254
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,040
don't check on others because the one

1255
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,400
thing that I've seen is that when when

1256
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,400
it comes to other protein brands, they

1257
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,559
usually show fitness freaks consuming

1258
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,960
protein. Yeah. I don't think that way

1259
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,800
luckily. Okay. Because it's almost like

1260
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,240
the Safola mistake, right? When Safola

1261
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,040
first started, they only presented

1262
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,559
themselves as oil meant for people who

1263
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,000
have heart problems. And then eventually

1264
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,680
they realized that the TAM is too low.

1265
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,520
And then they expanded in such a way

1266
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,680
that they communicated the idea that if

1267
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,079
you do not want to have a heart problem

1268
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,480
then you must consume Safula. Suddenly

1269
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,000
the TAM exploded. Yeah. But we have been

1270
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,319
working around guilt-free consumption as

1271
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,839
an idea. But sir, how super you

1272
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,920
guiltfree? It's just a better for you

1273
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,520
product, right? That is guiltfree in a

1274
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,319
way.

1275
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,160
Okay. I would I would disagree on this

1276
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,040
because

1277
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,599
guilt-free would require you to have

1278
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,920
less carbs. Any consumption today people

1279
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:33,280
question it. Why am I consuming it? You

1280
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,800
have to remove that guilt. Why sir?

1281
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,000
New generation is questioning every

1282
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,680
consumption. Hm. So you are giving them

1283
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,200
a reason to consume. Okay. So superu is

1284
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,480
definitely better than a Cadbury. My

1285
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,160
question is first of all where do you

1286
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,920
place superu in terms of competitors? I

1287
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,119
don't want to place it anywhere. Why

1288
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,119
not? I I think we got the right spot

1289
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,520
luckily. But what is that right spot?

1290
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,480
Because the right spot is uh people are

1291
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,319
enjoying it. People are repeating it and

1292
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,319
people are loving it and people are

1293
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,800
loving it for the energy with the

1294
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,960
product is and it's a one of the truest

1295
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,520
celebrity launch product I would say in

1296
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,599
the history of this country. It reflects

1297
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,800
the personality of the founder. So now I

1298
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,079
want to talk to you about these

1299
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,000
terminologies that you mentioned

1300
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,079
societal truth. What exactly is the

1301
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,079
societal truth that you spoke about? I

1302
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,960
think society has certain codes about

1303
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,640
everything. Okay. Like society has a

1304
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,880
code about marriages. Society has code

1305
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,359
about festival. Society has created many

1306
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,040
many codes for us. Let's take superu for

1307
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:35,440
example. In this case, what exactly was

1308
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,160
that societal? The societal code is uh

1309
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,000
currently the societal code is it is a

1310
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,400
it's a it's a consumption which is an

1311
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,880
extra you don't need this consumption

1312
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,119
but then protein creates the need. Let's

1313
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,280
consume some we are protein deficient.

1314
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,520
Let's consume the protein. So the

1315
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,680
societal code is the it's a it's a more

1316
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,200
modern societal code and we are not

1317
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,119
dealing with a very traditional societal

1318
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,079
code. It still comes into the

1319
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:03,280
consumption of food. It's a kind of a

1320
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,520
snacking in between meals and it is a

1321
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,319
consumption which can sometimes it's a

1322
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,319
indulgence also. Got it. So over here

1323
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,280
societal code is we need to consume more

1324
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,880
protein. Yeah. And how do you think the

1325
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,160
societal codes would play out for a

1326
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,480
category like beauty? I think beauty the

1327
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,240
Indian societal codes are around beauty

1328
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,119
are quite quite interesting. They are

1329
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:28,000
around washing the hair. It's around

1330
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:31,040
making your eyes look beautiful and

1331
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,520
using a flower element in your hair.

1332
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,640
They were the traditional societal

1333
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,400
codes. Every community has their

1334
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,359
societal code. South India deals with

1335
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:43,680
hair quite a lot. Okay.

1336
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:47,000
and uh rest of the country I think uh

1337
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,240
eyes are have been one of

1338
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,680
the expression of beauty in this in this

1339
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,520
and how does that translate into and

1340
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,359
consu how does that look at look at all

1341
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,240
the songs written during the period of

1342
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:01,800
60s or 70s around

1343
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:04,400
beauty would be around uh the moon the

1344
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:06,440
hair the face it was never about the

1345
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,200
skin as

1346
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,960
much there was a song We saw Chandan

1347
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,200
Sabadan which was more about the skin

1348
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,119
but otherwise beauty codes were all

1349
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,200
around uh face, eyes, hair to a great

1350
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,680
extent. And then we started saying

1351
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,839
gorier goreier. Yeah. Skin color was

1352
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:27,440
always there in this country. So that

1353
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:30,480
was never a doubt about it. Got it. So

1354
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,400
you're saying that the societal codes

1355
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,880
are in a way also born out of pop

1356
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,559
culture. They are born out of I would

1357
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,520
say mythology in a way or the old

1358
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,680
stories which resides in the society

1359
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,040
which are then amplified by pop culture

1360
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,760
right multiple things also pop culture

1361
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,000
also lyrics also songs also cinema the

1362
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,599
pop culture yeah and if I were to apply

1363
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,680
this in the context of superu how would

1364
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,480
that be

1365
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,040
I think we we were I think we have a

1366
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,440
full team of brand

1367
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:04,079
thinkers nikun had

1368
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,599
been earlier in uh some role in some

1369
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,000
food business. So he knew about the

1370
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:11,040
product the category. He himself is a

1371
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,680
gym goer. So he understand the he was a

1372
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,079
protein consumer. He had a co-founder

1373
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,400
who is a protein consumer. So firstly

1374
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,559
there is a truth that they are part of

1375
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,839
the consumption. Correct. Secondly they

1376
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:25,119
have a great intention of giving a great

1377
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:27,920
product with the brand personality comes

1378
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,520
in the energy of the founder. I think

1379
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,280
lot of things comes together to build a

1380
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,720
brand. So like five elements make the

1381
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,480
planet earth. There are multiple

1382
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,960
elements which makes the brand succeed.

1383
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,440
Then you spoke about ritual sir. What is

1384
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,440
customer

1385
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,040
rituals? I think every brand uh every

1386
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,160
category or every

1387
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,400
branditual. So let's take the case of

1388
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:55,200
superu. Super the rituals of the brand

1389
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,200
would be around in between meals

1390
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,559
situation

1391
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,040
situation. Wow. M I think sir Bellavita

1392
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:27,440
did this very well. They had uh four

1393
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:30,760
perfumes. One was club man, the other

1394
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:35,760
was CEO man and then they had

1395
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:37,839
oud and uh they had one more musk. So

1396
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,119
club man was meant for people going to

1397
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:43,599
the club and then they had CEO man for

1398
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,440
people who are going to the office

1399
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,920
because they wanted to feel like a CEO.

1400
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,319
Would you consider this to be customer

1401
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,960
rituals?

1402
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,480
I don't know. I'm talking of the

1403
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,960
communication brand communication. This

1404
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,200
is a product

1405
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,440
positioning and uh I would say merely

1406
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,799
Bella as a brand. I don't know whether

1407
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,319
it is talking to me or whether I'm a

1408
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,960
consumer because I don't I have not

1409
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:09,040
consumed their content yet. So I would

1410
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,799
rather put like superu if you have seen

1411
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,520
the

1412
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:16,720
content it will relate to anybody who is

1413
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,040
into high energy stuff. M got it

1414
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,040
understood. So brand ritual, customer

1415
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,200
ritual you're saying is how do you place

1416
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,280
your product in the day of the customer

1417
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,440
in various situations in the day of the

1418
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,799
customer. For example, if I have to talk

1419
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,440
about skincare, it's always in the

1420
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:35,119
morning right after taking bath. If I

1421
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,119
have to talk about cereals, it's during

1422
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:40,400
breakfast. Brand ritual becomes very

1423
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,559
important. Brand ritual eating sir

1424
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,000
dinner time. People usually consume our

1425
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,480
content during dinner time and when it

1426
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,920
comes to podcast it's usually during the

1427
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,920
flight. So during that time we get two

1428
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,760
and a half hours of an undistracted

1429
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,359
consumer who watches our content. Would

1430
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,000
you consider this to be brand ritual?

1431
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:59,599
Absolutely. So I I consumed your last

1432
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,319
content with uh Vidant

1433
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,960
or Manavar. It was on my last flight two

1434
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,960
days back from Bangalore to Bombay. What

1435
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,280
do you think about the podcast sir? Yeah

1436
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,520
I I was able to go through it fully. So

1437
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,319
I think it was a good content and a 24

1438
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,799
year old boy

1439
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:18,960
talking loads and loads of sense. Yeah.

1440
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,000
Was quite quite fascinating and I was

1441
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,040
very fascinated by his story of uh how

1442
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,440
early age he got into business. So that

1443
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,680
fascinated me more than anything else.

1444
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,480
Sir very few people have been successful

1445
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,400
in raising sons who are that smart, that

1446
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,079
wise. What do you think results into

1447
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,520
that? Sometimes I get scared when the

1448
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,839
person is so wise at this age. Why sir?

1449
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,839
I don't

1450
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:50,240
know. At 24 when I look back I was I was

1451
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,000
absolutely dumbo in front of him.

1452
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,319
That's very interesting. So from here to

1453
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,960
where will he go up to is going to be

1454
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,640
very fascinating for me. True.

1455
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,200
Beautiful. But that was an interesting

1456
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,839
story. I I enjoyed the journey of his

1457
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,200
upbringing. Beautiful. Sir then you

1458
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:09,280
spoke about role models. Are these just

1459
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,200
brand ambassadors? I think people what

1460
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:15,000
happens uh we all need role models for

1461
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,160
me

1462
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,839
uh I have role models in life at various

1463
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,839
point of time in my life. I would have

1464
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:24,240
had role model who might be an author

1465
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:26,960
who might be a film star who might be

1466
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,839
one of the friends who I admire or some

1467
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:33,640
very successful business person and we

1468
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:37,520
started we start subconsciously aping

1469
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,520
them and

1470
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:44,079
I think that become very important in

1471
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,079
building a brand for example.

1472
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:55,040
Sirion event or

1473
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:58,559
life boost the secret of life. Today

1474
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,640
when I look at my my role models in

1475
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,280
podcaster I would have my role models in

1476
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,799
cinema I would have my role models in

1477
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,359
business I have my role models. those

1478
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:10,960
whom I look up to subconsciously you're

1479
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:13,599
aping that m how does this result into a

1480
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,680
consumer behavior that subconsciously if

1481
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,799
you are if I'm able to build that role

1482
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,559
models in my communication to you and I

1483
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:23,359
talk about them you will resonate with

1484
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,839
my brand for example how do how would a

1485
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:28,480
watch brand do it watch brand must be

1486
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:32,720
showing some celebrity wearing that

1487
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,960
watch or Roger Federer and tennis or

1488
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,280
sports leadership Roger Federer role

1489
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,880
model that brand will appeal to you.

1490
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,640
Correct. And if an entrepreneur does not

1491
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,200
have the budget to get a Roger Federer,

1492
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,520
Roger Federer, that role model who can

1493
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,319
play that

1494
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,359
archetype. How do you build that

1495
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:51,839
archetype? Just say for example, when it

1496
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:55,440
comes to Malbor man, Philip Morris built

1497
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:58,720
a great archetype out of the American

1498
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,520
masculine aspiration to then create

1499
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,079
Malbor man. So they understood that

1500
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,079
American men want to be rough and tough.

1501
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,160
They but they created a role model of a

1502
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,000
particular look of a particular way

1503
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,319
which is a cowboy which is a hat which

1504
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,079
is a horse and which

1505
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:17,520
is I think a particular imagery which

1506
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,920
they created. So I'm trying to

1507
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,680
understand how do you go about

1508
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,319
understanding role models and then

1509
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,760
emulate that in your brand

1510
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:27,440
communication. So if you are a watch

1511
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:32,000
startup who doesn't have the brand to

1512
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,000
get Roger Federer what should be your

1513
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:43,640
approach 8000 watch it is meant for

1514
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:47,760
people between the age of 18 to

1515
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:50,640
25 and uh this watch is meant for only

1516
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,640
those people who see themselves as car

1517
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,640
enthusiasts

1518
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,040
So how would you communicate your idea

1519
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,960
enthusiast? In fact, I've invested in a

1520
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,000
company called Rutus which does exactly

1521
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:07,280
this. Mhm. So I want to understand how

1522
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,280
would you approach I think

1523
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:15,400
to engineering fast speed associate

1524
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,400
engine

1525
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,400
associate

1526
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,400
and I think auto I don't know how many

1527
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,640
people follow them but that's not widely

1528
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,920
not much. So now you'll have to look at

1529
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,599
somebody who is an uh who loves speed,

1530
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:39,359
who loves cars, who loves

1531
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:40,680
racing and you'll have to find a role

1532
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:43,599
model out there.

1533
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:45,040
Yeah, I'm not a person who follows that.

1534
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,520
So I wouldn't be able to know the names

1535
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,799
of the people. But I can tell you that

1536
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,119
there are there would be enough and

1537
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:52,880
enough of people on this circuit. So

1538
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,440
you're saying that whatever the customer

1539
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,839
aspires and whatever the story what so

1540
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,000
it's like a ven diagram. This is the

1541
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,760
customer story. This is the customer

1542
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,799
aspiration. And then you have the brand

1543
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,160
story. And you'll have to find a person

1544
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,480
or you'll have to create an archetype

1545
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,480
like Malber

1546
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,119
man who can fall exactly at the center.

1547
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,680
Totally. Is that correct? Totally. Okay.

1548
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:20,480
And when any consumer is seeing that, he

1549
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,480
is able to relate to

1550
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,839
it.

1551
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:30,160
Correct. Yes sir. Listen in the US they

1552
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,000
understood that in fact Listrine back

1553
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,240
then was a general liquid. It could be

1554
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,520
used for everything. It was more a lot

1555
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,760
of people say it was a floor cleaner

1556
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,920
also. Correct. It was a floor cleaner.

1557
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,839
And then they found out that if you have

1558
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,839
to resonate with the American public,

1559
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:45,200
you can't consider general public to be

1560
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:47,200
your audience. You have to choose one

1561
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,599
category. And then they chose women and

1562
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:52,400
then they understood the societal truth.

1563
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,559
In in in in marketing and brand parlance

1564
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:59,040
we call it the mating category. What do

1565
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,040
you mean by that? Boys category.

1566
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:07,520
Okay. Correct. Acts. Yeah. Clothing to a

1567
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,200
certain extent to dating mating

1568
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,559
category. It's for the other sex to be

1569
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:15,200
pleased. So these people understood that

1570
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,119
mouthwash could be a great solution

1571
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,280
because women always wanted to impress

1572
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,200
rich men which is why they came up with

1573
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,920
a term called heltosis where they said

1574
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,760
that if you have foul breath that is

1575
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,520
because of heltosis whereas that was

1576
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,359
just a general phenomenon that's how

1577
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,920
that's how body works and then they

1578
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:33,760
placed to you in this case if I have to

1579
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,039
understand this principle that you

1580
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:40,240
taught me the societal truth is women

1581
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:43,119
want to impress men totally Okay. The

1582
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,640
story of the brand is we will help you

1583
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,640
impress men and the story that they told

1584
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:52,000
the customer is that if you don't use

1585
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,240
listing you'll be single for life.

1586
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,240
on

1587
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,319
fear where there's an actress who's

1588
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,440
extremely beautiful but she's single

1589
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:10,720
because she's not able to get men. So

1590
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,839
would you consider this to be an

1591
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,920
application of the principle that you

1592
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:16,920
just taught me? Totally. Yes. Okay.

1593
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,920
Beautiful.

1594
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:22,400
So now let's come to what did you do

1595
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,720
after pantaloons? After pantaloons you

1596
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,160
started central then you had brand

1597
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,520
factory then you had several other

1598
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,599
brands. So when did you move out of

1599
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,520
clothing?

1600
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,760
I think big brother made us move out of

1601
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:37,920
clothing significantly because bigar

1602
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,440
core product was FM food and grocery and

1603
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,720
what made you move from clothing to

1604
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,599
grocery because they're two completely

1605
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,960
different domain. Yeah, we were I if you

1606
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,559
look at my backdrop was uh yarn

1607
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,640
manufacturer, fabric manufacturer,

1608
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:53,119
garment manufacturer, then a brand

1609
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,599
creator and then a retailer. Okay. And

1610
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,520
once you became a retailer, we thought

1611
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,760
uh if you are able to sell fashion,

1612
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,559
let's create the frequency of customers

1613
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,280
buying more with grocery. That's where

1614
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:08,960
the grocery came about.

1615
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:12,559
And uh the idea was to create a new kind

1616
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:15,839
of a bazaar in India where ordinary

1617
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:18,079
people can shop. Okay. Now when it comes

1618
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,440
to pantaloons and central what was the

1619
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,119
fundamental difference because they were

1620
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,960
all retail stores multipliers pantaloon

1621
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,200
was designed as a family store for every

1622
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,799
member of the family. Central was

1623
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,280
designed as a brand for a group of

1624
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:33,680
friends little younger than panthons.

1625
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,720
And thirdly, when bigar was designed, it

1626
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,079
was again designed for the family and a

1627
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,760
little younger family with younger

1628
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,400
children.

1629
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,480
Got it. And also a joint family as a

1630
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,599
idea. How did you scale so quickly sir?

1631
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,359
Because I was reading that you were

1632
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,799
present in what more than 400 uh cities

1633
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:53,280
around? Uh big mazar was present in

1634
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,720
close to 190 200 cities with easy day

1635
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,039
and other formats. We were present in

1636
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,520
400 cities. But how did you scale so

1637
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:02,559
fast?

1638
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:05,200
Yeah. Was that I think that uh that was

1639
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,039
a different era. Okay. And we were the

1640
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,400
early

1641
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:10,559
players. We were getting successes

1642
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,079
wherever we were opening. Our model was

1643
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:18,119
quite interesting. Consumers were able

1644
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:18,119
to relate to us. And people used to say

1645
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,599
Big was also a symbol of progress in the

1646
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:36,400
country in a

1647
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:39,039
way progressive.

1648
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,480
Got it. So we were part of a consumption

1649
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,640
revolution which was happening in the

1650
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:45,599
country. Did you expand pantaloons using

1651
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,079
a franchise model? No, never. Why not

1652
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,799
sir? I personally don't believe in

1653
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,599
franchising model unless it's a it's a

1654
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:55,319
product wherein everything can be

1655
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:57,359
standardized in a clothing business to

1656
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:59,839
standardize quite a lot of things is

1657
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:02,720
very difficult. Why why don't you

1658
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,720
believe in franchise model

1659
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,119
imp everything is perfected to an extent

1660
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:12,359
wherein anybody else can replicate it

1661
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:15,799
without impacting the consumer but

1662
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:18,520
clothing difficult the customer service

1663
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:21,520
customer the motivation of a

1664
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:21,520
store

1665
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:25,039
franchisee for a smaller store may be

1666
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,880
okay but for a larger store very

1667
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,880
difficult why because you're dealing

1668
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,559
with multiple departments Like can you

1669
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,720
give me an example of the different

1670
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,240
clothing store? We were dealing with

1671
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,359
children. We were dealing with women. We

1672
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,359
were dealing with in woman

1673
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,640
ethnic

1674
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:59,039
department. I think people have done it

1675
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:01,920
very effectively in some other business

1676
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,920
models like Manu.

1677
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,559
Man virtually they might be running the

1678
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,240
store. Yeah, they run the store and they

1679
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,960
have taken the investment of the

1680
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,160
furniture fixtures and they pay the rent

1681
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,920
themselves. So it's a very different

1682
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,799
model wherein they are in control of the

1683
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,319
total customer experience. Then why

1684
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,920
couldn't you opt in for that model sir?

1685
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,120
Because if you have to expand it using

1686
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,279
your own money that would result into

1687
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,759
high capex. Yeah but maybe we didn't

1688
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,279
discover that model. Yeah, during that

1689
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,839
time it was not very popular. I think

1690
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,839
our capital investment was quite high.

1691
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:34,880
Like central used to be two lakh square

1692
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,799
stores two lakh square ft². One of our

1693
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,960
central was we had three four stores

1694
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:41,359
were which were in excess of two lakhs.

1695
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,199
So did you buy them or lease them? Lease

1696
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,560
them. And how much would that lease

1697
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:48,359
cost? At at our peak uh our total rental

1698
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,159
at future group would be

1699
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:54,560
2,400 crores a year. My god. It was

1700
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:56,640
huge. including warehouses, including

1701
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,759
offices, including

1702
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,319
stores. So do you think a franchiseowned

1703
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:05,279
company operated model would have made

1704
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:08,000
you capex free?

1705
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,080
I think in hindsight one can say a lot

1706
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,920
but we had operating lease model also

1707
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:16,960
developed. So we we tried multiple

1708
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,839
things. Uh so I think it's a story of

1709
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,120
the past in a way. So one can always say

1710
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:22,560
in mindset this could have been done

1711
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,759
that could have been done because sir

1712
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,759
the reason why I consider it to be

1713
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,880
important is because even at think

1714
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,719
school we are trying to understand how

1715
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,920
do we scale our communication school and

1716
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,480
the first thing that comes to our mind

1717
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,560
is the franchise model um if you look at

1718
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,159
blueto guy subco they don't have a

1719
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,080
franchise model yet but eventually they

1720
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:39,520
might shift to a franchise model and the

1721
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,679
reason why people shift to I'm not a

1722
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,960
great believer of franchise model still

1723
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,880
oh why why not sir I think we can debate

1724
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:50,000
this because uh we have done some work

1725
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,759
around it Okay. And uh it can work not

1726
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,320
in all situation. It can work in some

1727
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,159
situation. That's my theory.

1728
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,000
Walk me through the situation sir. I

1729
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,920
think it's all upon uh what kind of

1730
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,840
customer experience you want to control.

1731
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,080
Okay. Do you think franchise model is

1732
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,000
possible in coffee like a blue tai

1733
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,760
model?

1734
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,920
I wouldn't know that business as much

1735
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,920
but there is a possibility out there but

1736
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,280
it's too

1737
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,480
early. You have to build the model

1738
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,960
perfect it. And I believe in when I look

1739
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,960
at the world now I came into business in

1740
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,560
late

1741
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:27,199
'80s and I when I look back in

1742
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:29,120
2025 and uh I'll just give you a story I

1743
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:30,440
must have studied the organizational

1744
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,360
lifespan of

1745
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:36,239
organizations where in the this study I

1746
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:38,159
must have done it in '90s or 2000 that

1747
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:40,159
what is the leverage lifespan of an

1748
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:43,679
organization that time it was recorded

1749
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,679
was 26 years okay so organizations get

1750
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,520
built They go through their childhood.

1751
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,800
They go through their adolescence. They

1752
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,800
go through their teens. They go through

1753
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,800
their

1754
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,080
youth and some of most of the

1755
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,159
organization which survived more than

1756
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,320
100 years didn't survive in its original

1757
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:02,000
form. Okay. For example, I would say

1758
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,440
Dupo lot of organizations except a

1759
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,640
financial organization which survives in

1760
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,440
its original form. When I did this

1761
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,440
research uh 3 4 years ago, the average

1762
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,159
lifespan of organization came down to 18

1763
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:17,440
years. 18 years. This is still some

1764
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:20,480
years ago. If I do the research now, I

1765
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:23,199
think it will come down to less than 12

1766
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:25,760
14 years. Okay.

1767
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:29,040
And I believe if I do the research after

1768
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,920
AI has been implemented or it has been

1769
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,280
adopted by businesses in the next 2 3

1770
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:37,440
years, it will drop down to six seven

1771
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:39,840
years. So there is a impermanency as a

1772
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,520
thought which has to be designed for any

1773
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,120
new organization to be built. We are not

1774
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,520
permanent. We will not survive in our

1775
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:47,679
original form. Correct? Impermanency is

1776
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,679
a part of it. How do you deal with

1777
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,600
franchising in an impermanency kind of a

1778
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,120
situation?

1779
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,440
Let's take one category sir. Let's take

1780
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:57,760
food as a category. Very impermanency is

1781
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:00,000
built in into food.

1782
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,239
But if you were to understand the

1783
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,520
category of burgers, let's say, they

1784
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,880
have brought in

1785
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,040
permanency and tomorrow's business will

1786
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,520
not be in permanency as much as what the

1787
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,040
old era was. That's my theory. I can be

1788
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,480
wrong. There will be exceptions to every

1789
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,000
theory.

1790
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,159
So if you look at McDonald's which is a

1791
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,840
franchise

1792
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:23,520
example they they have perfected their

1793
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:26,880
menu to an extent wherein it can be

1794
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,760
soped or anybody can run it with some

1795
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,560
controls and some uh what do you call

1796
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,239
following or of the

1797
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:37,880
specifications to build a new businesses

1798
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:40,320
uh without that kind of perfection and

1799
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,159
franchising when impermanence is built

1800
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,920
into the model. How will a franchisee

1801
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:45,600
deal with impermanence?

1802
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,120
Sir, let's take Jumbo King because I

1803
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,679
understand the business model very well.

1804
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,920
Jumbo King sells burgers. Now, they keep

1805
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,840
changing their menus based on data and

1806
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,480
they get customer feedback actively from

1807
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,280
every franchise. And once data is

1808
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,760
understood very well, it is quite

1809
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,840
obvious to understand in which place

1810
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,120
what kind of burgers are doing well. And

1811
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,120
if you look at burger, it's a

1812
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,480
combination of only four things. If the

1813
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,000
variables are less, it's possible to

1814
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,280
franchise. Correct? In a fashion

1815
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,520
business, the amount of variables we

1816
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:16,560
were dealing with was so huge.

1817
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:19,760
We had around uh 16,000 SKUs in big

1818
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,840
bazada. How do you franchise that

1819
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,000
but man has been able to do that simply

1820
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,760
because of data sir? Mana is doing it

1821
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
because they still control the customer

1822
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,360
experience.

1823
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,120
So which means franchise model is

1824
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,560
possible if you're able to control the

1825
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,840
customer experience. Totally. I would

1826
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,960
love to control the customer experience.

1827
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,400
What are the factors that come under

1828
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,159
controlling customer experience?

1829
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,679
Managing it. All the rewards and uh

1830
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,520
recognition is given by you to the

1831
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,719
people who are working. For example,

1832
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,560
let's break this down. If there is a

1833
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,719
store staff or the store head or store

1834
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,560
manager, store, whatever you call him,

1835
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,560
he's under whose control and what is his

1836
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,280
motivation?

1837
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,640
If he's under the control of a

1838
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,560
franchisee, so franchisee will create a

1839
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,880
reward system for him which not which

1840
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,719
will not suit to the brand. So you're

1841
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,719
saying we should first control the

1842
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,840
employee incentives,

1843
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,120
entire customer experience and who first

1844
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,760
who provides for that customer

1845
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:12,400
experience? First is the is the product

1846
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,640
product it's a service and it is after

1847
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,400
sale service and the total vibe or the

1848
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,080
environment which you create which is

1849
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,360
basically infrastructure. Yeah. Total

1850
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,159
vibe and the environment and how do you

1851
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:25,199
maintain

1852
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:25,199
that very early in my life I

1853
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:38,719
did the customer experience is not the

1854
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,719
same. It's a very it's a art which has

1855
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,520
to be perfected.

1856
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,040
But do you think because of

1857
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,400
digitalization and data analysis this

1858
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,080
could become easier? It's possible. It's

1859
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,320
much much better than what it used to be

1860
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,239
earlier. But then there is a new theory

1861
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,760
of impermanence which has shaped it. You

1862
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,040
will not survive in your original firm.

1863
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,800
You'll have to keep on pivoting your

1864
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,320
businesses. Correct. But data will tell

1865
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,600
you where to pivot. Right. Yeah. But

1866
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,719
then there will be too much of a change.

1867
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,360
How will you keep on training your

1868
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:04,000
people the franchisee to deal with that?

1869
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:06,159
But sir impermanency whatever whatever

1870
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,760
impermanency comes out of data it's not

1871
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:13,280
so I think there would be revolutionary

1872
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:17,040
impermanency which is sipping in. Sir

1873
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,040
let's debate this out. subject

1874
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,400
futuristic businesses are all heading

1875
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,480
towards impermanence. Understood sir.

1876
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,400
Now when it comes to food business, you

1877
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,880
said that franchising is very very

1878
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,560
difficult. But why is that? Food

1879
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,840
business may franchising is still easier

1880
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,440
than the clothing business. That's what

1881
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,280
I said. Okay. But you said that the

1882
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,880
franchising will not work for a category

1883
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,040
like food in the future. I'm not saying

1884
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,320
that at all. I'm saying that franchising

1885
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,679
may wherever you can control the

1886
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,080
customer experience, it will work and

1887
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:46,800
where the number of variables are less.

1888
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,400
Wherever you can standardize things. Got

1889
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,239
when you deal with impermanence, you

1890
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,600
cannot standardize things and you're

1891
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:53,199
saying fashion is once and your

1892
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,520
variables will keep on coming up again

1893
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,520
and

1894
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,560
again. Now when it comes to fashion,

1895
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,520
let's say you run a company operated

1896
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:05,120
franchise own store, the franchisees

1897
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,800
just put in the investment. You are

1898
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,640
managing the company, the store staff is

1899
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,480
rewarded by you. Where is the issue?

1900
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,760
Which will require you to not I think

1901
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,719
that's not franchising. That's a

1902
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,840
financing model. H but we're just

1903
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,199
putting it under the franchising is

1904
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,960
where the franchise is the operator

1905
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,480
where that is where I have concern.

1906
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,320
Understood. So you're saying that a

1907
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,320
franchise owned franchise operated model

1908
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,800
is a bad model. I'm not saying it's a

1909
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,080
bad model. I'm saying that uh the

1910
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,000
customer experience is controlled by

1911
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,920
them. So you are not in control of your

1912
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,480
fortunes.

1913
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,239
So any place where you're dependent on

1914
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,320
the franchise operation is where the

1915
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:40,640
threat is. It's not a threat. It's a it

1916
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,159
has to be perfected model there. Your

1917
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,320
variables have to be low and you have to

1918
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:46,320
be in control of the franchisee who is

1919
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,679
giving that experience to the consumer

1920
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,440
because he's using your brand because

1921
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,520
human dependence and that's where the

1922
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,360
impermanencies will kick in and you have

1923
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,960
no data to be able to track that until

1924
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,640
the harm has already been done. For

1925
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,320
example, if there's a store manager who

1926
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,600
does not know how to behave, you will

1927
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,840
see the impact in the customer

1928
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,000
experience way later as compared to when

1929
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,480
you should have. So that is where you

1930
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,239
can't perfect human impermanencies.

1931
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:13,840
But if this person is the franchise

1932
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:15,360
owner, the likelihood of him not

1933
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,239
behaving properly is very less. You're

1934
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,400
dealing with that variables which is not

1935
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:22,480
in your control. But that is going to be

1936
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,000
an impermanency. Even when there is an

1937
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,920
employee of yours who's going to be at

1938
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,760
the store, right?

1939
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,360
I think still he's rewarded by you and

1940
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:32,400
incentivized by you. You can hire and

1941
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,800
fire him. But so but you can even fire

1942
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,920
the franchise owner. Not easy. Why not

1943
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,440
sir? It's not easy. But why is there a

1944
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,800
legal complication to that? There are a

1945
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:44,520
lot of issues to that because the

1946
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,520
property is in his nameally.

1947
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,560
Got it. So again that you have to

1948
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,159
control the customer experience. So you

1949
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,920
will have to I would like to be in

1950
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:56,640
control of the customer experience in a

1951
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,480
franchising system. That's it. If it can

1952
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,560
be perfected, why not? I'm not against

1953
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,199
any model as such. Every kind of model

1954
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,880
works in certain situations, not in all

1955
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,480
situations. Understood? So the

1956
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,480
conclusion is your variables have to be

1957
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,840
less your impermanencies have to be

1958
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:14,080
controlled and because of data today it

1959
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,159
has become comparatively easier and the

1960
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,800
more you have dependency on the

1961
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:20,320
operations of the franchise owner that's

1962
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,600
where complications will kick in so if

1963
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,800
it is a franchise operated by the

1964
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,480
company where you can control the

1965
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,199
variables it is great and the variables

1966
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,719
are a function of product service

1967
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,400
environment and infrastructure I'll just

1968
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,239
tell you very softer thing now if you go

1969
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,719
to any particular store you can feel the

1970
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:37,760
energy of that store I don't know how to

1971
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:39,440
quantify it but you feel it and that is

1972
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,679
the sum total of the effort put into

1973
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,679
that

1974
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:48,880
store consistently but as a as a brand

1975
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,800
owner you will put in that effort for

1976
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:54,239
sure franchisee how is he motivated or

1977
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,320
incentivized to put in that extra effort

1978
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,920
understood got it so that is the reason

1979
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,360
why you did not expand pant loons using

1980
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,800
the fun I don't know what I did that

1981
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,239
time but I'm talking of franchising as a

1982
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,760
concept got it and then When you stepped

1983
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,960
into Big Bazar, how was Big Bazar born

1984
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,880
as an idea? How did you spot that

1985
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,040
opportunity?

1986
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,040
I

1987
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:18,800
think India was a full India is full of

1988
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:20,719
bajars now also. Correct. And I think

1989
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,960
after liberalization consumption of new

1990
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,320
categories was

1991
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:27,280
happening and how do new categories

1992
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:29,360
needs a particular environment to sell

1993
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:31,760
and consumption can be created if you

1994
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,080
create an environment to sell. I think

1995
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,760
if you look at the history of

1996
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:40,239
communication, we as a civilization, our

1997
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:42,159
first communication modes were oral,

1998
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:45,520
katas,

1999
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:49,360
uh people hearing somebody. Then came in

2000
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,920
the press where there is a authoritarian

2001
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,560
author learned person who is talking and

2002
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:57,360
lot of people listening to him. Then

2003
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,360
came television which was which actually

2004
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,960
created brands which actually created

2005
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,400
businesses and consumption because it

2006
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,080
was one visual medium where in

2007
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,159
advertising through you could work on

2008
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,080
the imaging of the consumers a

2009
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,520
centralized medium which could appeal to

2010
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,440
millions and millions of people that's

2011
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,520
why brands got built that's where FMCG

2012
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,560
companies got built that is when the

2013
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:21,440
retailers got built to a great extent

2014
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:23,840
now we are back to social media which is

2015
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:26,560
not a centralized media of communication

2016
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,679
So the world is changing again. A

2017
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,880
influencer can appeal to x number of

2018
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:32,320
people. There is no centralized medium

2019
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,920
of communication. So we have to think

2020
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,440
about brands in a very different way,

2021
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,520
consumption in a different way. So

2022
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,760
that's what uh the world is moving

2023
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,080
towards and that's where I believe the

2024
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,800
impermanence is setting in because if

2025
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,400
you look at uh the

2026
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,920
consumers in the original days when

2027
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,520
there was oral form of communication

2028
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,000
they had all the time in the world to

2029
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:55,120
consume that communication and ponder

2030
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,199
over it think over it. Correct. When

2031
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,960
press came in, we had again lot of time

2032
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:04,480
to think, write a letter to that person,

2033
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,239
get into that thinking. Television may

2034
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,080
we

2035
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:10,159
believed whatever they were saying, dust

2036
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,880
us, the consumption, we tried every

2037
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:14,560
product, then we made our own judgment.

2038
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,719
Now we are again in a world of

2039
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:20,000
communication wherein we are consuming

2040
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:22,800
so much of content our span of attention

2041
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,360
and our theory to reflect back or to

2042
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,880
consume that content and process it

2043
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:30,880
doesn't exist. So we are in a new world

2044
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,760
and this new world is creating new

2045
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,120
brands, new products, new

2046
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,360
consumers and we have to be relevant to

2047
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,960
them. So back in the day what was this

2048
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,719
paradigm shift that inspired you to

2049
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,679
start big business? Yeah, I think

2050
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:46,159
television newspapers were the medium of

2051
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:48,239
to create uh demand, create new

2052
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,120
categories, build new products, build

2053
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:53,440
new set of consumers. It was huge. It

2054
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:57,040
was crazy. What time was this sir? Which

2055
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:59,920
year? I think we started uh big sometime

2056
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,760
in 2000. 2000. So this is when

2057
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,080
liberalization was at its peak. Yeah.

2058
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:06,560
Yeah. It was like we've created so many

2059
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:09,360
categories in the country. M like we

2060
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,840
were once upon a time 15% of luggage

2061
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,760
trade in the country itself we luggage

2062
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,000
15% of the total luggage trade general

2063
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,960
trade modern trade all put together. Oh

2064
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,920
wow. We were we must be percentage of

2065
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:24,159
most of the sales in the country. So it

2066
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,159
was a different era where consumption uh

2067
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:28,400
you could work on creating consumption.

2068
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:30,159
People were wanting to experiment things

2069
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,760
were happening.

2070
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:34,239
Got it. So from the economic standpoint

2071
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,239
if I were to see the per capita income

2072
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:38,600
was increasing drastically. Number two

2073
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:40,880
the medium India had a huge amount of

2074
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:43,440
savings. Uh if you look at the savings

2075
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,600
then and the savings now it has all gone

2076
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,920
into sir yesterday I was reading a stat

2077
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,679
which said India savings is at a 47 year

2078
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,600
old low. So that's what I'm saying we

2079
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,440
were responsible to reduce the savings

2080
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,480
of this country in a way. So there was

2081
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:59,000
money aspirations were rising

2082
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:02,080
liberalization was happening. the next

2083
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,360
generation was getting into a little bit

2084
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:07,760
of abundance I would say. So India as a

2085
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:10,719
society like when I was growing up I'm a

2086
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,760
I have been born in 60s. So the movies

2087
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,880
which we were seeing were all around

2088
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,480
shortages. We were not a abundant

2089
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,040
economy. We were just building our

2090
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:21,760
infrastructure,

2091
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,760
education products were not

2092
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:27,040
available. So we were born in a era of

2093
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,679
look at today's generation. We are

2094
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:32,320
abundance like abundance personified

2095
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,440
everything is there. So the world is

2096
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,199
changing. That's what I'm saying. the

2097
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,800
impermanence is seeping in much earlier.

2098
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:39,480
We we don't know what are we going to

2099
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:41,719
get into and our our attention spent to

2100
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:44,320
process doesn't

2101
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:46,560
exist. So it's a new generation. It's a

2102
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,400
new world. It's a new consumption. It it

2103
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,120
will be very interesting to build brands

2104
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:54,040
here now. Very beautiful. So I've

2105
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:56,239
understood that savings were very high

2106
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:58,800
comparatively comp as compared to today.

2107
01:23:56,239 --> 01:24:00,080
Income was rising and you had

2108
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,800
consumption rising and you could

2109
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,159
actually fuel in consumption because of

2110
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,080
television. huge television and press

2111
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:07,920
both used to work. There was a time when

2112
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:10,800
press and television work together. It

2113
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:13,199
was crazy. What do you mean by that sir?

2114
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,960
Front page ad used to get us crowds like

2115
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,920
unreal. Today if you advertise front

2116
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,400
page the crowds which will come will be

2117
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:24,080
nowhere. So how effective was this front

2118
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,080
page ad in terms of numbers you can't

2119
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:36,800
imagine that was the

2120
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,800
power.

2121
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,920
Wow.

2122
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:46,000
Zero comparison.

2123
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,719
And how much did the front page ad cost

2124
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,639
you?

2125
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,000
Because we were operating at a scale.

2126
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,159
I'll give you a very interesting example

2127
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,360
sir. This is the story of uh last to

2128
01:24:54,159 --> 01:25:00,080
last week. My friend Ana is conducting

2129
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:01,920
an AI workshop with economic times. He

2130
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:05,679
went to ED said I want to advertise on

2131
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:08,639
your newspaper. So we were like an why

2132
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:11,360
are you advertising on a newspaper? He

2133
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,480
said I just want to give it a shot. Sir,

2134
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:17,120
he was able to sell courses worth 50

2135
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,120
lakhs. But that's a very

2136
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,159
specified cost and because he's doing it

2137
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:26,080
in collaboration with ET, he's getting a

2138
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:27,679
certain percentage out of it. But 50

2139
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,719
lakh worth of sales because of a

2140
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,719
newspaper ad for

2141
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:36,320
AI. So let's not uh I think the

2142
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
effectiveness of ad today it's only for

2143
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,199
specific categories you can do

2144
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,480
communication. Which categories do you

2145
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,120
think are relevant for newspapers even

2146
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,040
today? I don't know. A launch any

2147
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,960
announcements.

2148
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,800
Not to do sales as much as announcement

2149
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,840
and launches. But how effective do you

2150
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,120
think these announcements are? Are

2151
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,639
announcements even? I think you need to

2152
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,159
announce something nowadays. Whenever

2153
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,639
you're launching a big thing, you have

2154
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,800
to announce I think uh real estate is

2155
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,239
still using it

2156
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,679
effectively. Announcing today I think a

2157
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,840
new serial is being launched called

2158
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:06,000
royals. Those announcement front page

2159
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,600
times of India you it is used for

2160
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,960
announcements. Got it. Understood. So

2161
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,960
then when you started Big Bazar, it

2162
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,199
started with just one store. We did

2163
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,880
three stores in 22 days. The idea was to

2164
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,560
three stores in 22 days. Yeah. It was

2165
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,400
about scale. Which city did you start

2166
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,400
from? I think it was Bangalore,

2167
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,400
Hyderabad.

2168
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:29,360
Which is Kolkata. Kolkata. And what was

2169
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,880
the model like? Like what was the

2170
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:33,000
difference between a big bazaar and a

2171
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:35,440
normal retail store in terms of cost?

2172
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,880
size, the way we used to put in the

2173
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:41,679
goods, the assortment and the prices.

2174
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,239
What went what went into it was a feel

2175
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:47,239
of a bazar of a bazar in air conditioned

2176
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:47,239
environment.

2177
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,199
What was your societal truth that you

2178
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,159
were banking on? I think the societal

2179
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:06,520
truth of a heart and

2180
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:08,760
a we are used to that hustle and

2181
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:11,719
bustle

2182
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:16,239
clean that was a big societal

2183
01:27:11,719 --> 01:27:18,120
truth because speak and spend hospital

2184
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:20,960
and

2185
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,880
spend hustle and bustle hustle and

2186
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,800
bustle I used to call it the butt and

2187
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,080
brush theory if you have not buted and

2188
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,120
brushed into somebody you're not

2189
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,520
shopping things have changed from there

2190
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:33,040
now M now we want things neat and clean.

2191
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,520
Yeah. Now things are very different.

2192
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:37,920
Yeah. So interestingly Sam Walton also

2193
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,480
said the same thing. He said that uh

2194
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:43,920
when he opened his first Walmart, he

2195
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:46,239
wanted it to be dirty because he wanted

2196
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:49,600
that store to look like a store where

2197
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:52,159
you could find cheap stuff. And uh his

2198
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:54,480
theory was if he spent too much on the

2199
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:56,560
air conditioning, a his cost was a a his

2200
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:59,520
cost would rise and b he would scare the

2201
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,199
common man away. And now that you saying

2202
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,440
about big bazar, it's very similar. It

2203
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,440
was very

2204
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:13,600
welcoming sir distinct memory when I

2205
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:15,760
first walked into big bazar. I saw the

2206
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,360
largest pack of parley g I had ever

2207
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:20,400
seen. Yeah, that was something which we

2208
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:23,199
did to sell huge huge packs. It was

2209
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:26,159
madness s and I saw surfexel which was

2210
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:27,920
so huge and when you see things that

2211
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:29,520
huge you get this feeling of abundance

2212
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,600
right that's such a distinct we played

2213
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,120
on abundance significantly what do you

2214
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,400
think worked for big bazar very well sir

2215
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,840
apart from just the pricing I think

2216
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,920
connecting with the consumers and being

2217
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,360
honest and truthful about oneself how

2218
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,480
can a bazar connect with the customer

2219
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:45,120
sir

2220
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:47,199
connect energy I I am a lot of believer

2221
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:49,600
in energy which is very difficult to

2222
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:51,520
rationalize and quantify but what was a

2223
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,400
brief to the team because you energy

2224
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:57,159
energy comes from

2225
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:59,320
everywhere future group staff was always

2226
01:28:57,159 --> 01:29:03,440
energetic environment was always

2227
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:03,440
electrifying office environment was

2228
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,920
electrifying

2229
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:10,480
mission I think that's what people have

2230
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,239
enjoyed working at future group and I

2231
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,320
sometimes when I'm talking I'm missing

2232
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:16,400
it but otherwise I don't look back that

2233
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,760
energy was very infectious how do you

2234
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,080
think future retail was different from

2235
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,199
demart I I think we were different born

2236
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:25,120
in a different era, different style of

2237
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:27,199
working, different uh aspirations,

2238
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,280
different imagination. Would you put

2239
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:31,679
yourself in the same category as Demart?

2240
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:33,840
No. Demart has a different consumer

2241
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,760
audience. Demart has lot of beauty.

2242
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,120
Demart is one company from which I have

2243
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,480
learned not to have many variables in

2244
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:43,760
life. Okay. Can you like they work on a

2245
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,760
x number of

2246
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:52,000
store they they cater to India to a new

2247
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,239
development or a new app. So they have

2248
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,080
defined the model. We were a product of

2249
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:57,600
a

2250
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:59,199
malls. We started with catering to India

2251
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,760
one more than India 2. India 2 we used

2252
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:03,920
to get them during events and festivals.

2253
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,560
So it was very different audiences.

2254
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:08,080
Secondly they they used to own the

2255
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,120
property.

2256
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:13,520
They I think the beauty of demart is the

2257
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:16,239
number of variables they use is much

2258
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,760
lesser. They say no to more things then

2259
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:20,639
they say yes. I think we were exactly

2260
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,840
the opposite. So very different and our

2261
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:24,639
aspiration was to capture the

2262
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,639
consumption of Indian

2263
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,560
consumer. I think that's where we were

2264
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,880
very different. Got it. And even big

2265
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,840
bazar was not franchised.

2266
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,760
Never. Never. Never. So you paid rent

2267
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,719
for all the stores everywhere. So when

2268
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:45,199
you chose a location for big bazar what

2269
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,600
went into the calculation? I think we

2270
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:49,639
were very early

2271
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:52,800
players real estate when I look

2272
01:30:49,639 --> 01:30:54,480
back we were good in real estate here in

2273
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,960
hindsight. I think we were very early

2274
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:59,080
players and we couldn't have gone wrong

2275
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,600
because

2276
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:03,760
India we knew where the catchments were

2277
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:07,480
where the India one or the aspirational

2278
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,480
India lived and

2279
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,520
So that was not so difficult as

2280
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:17,679
such you need data and where can you fet

2281
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:21,719
this data from data and the number of

2282
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:21,719
houses number of apartments

2283
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,960
data is not difficult so let's say a

2284
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,520
brand like zodia wants to establish

2285
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,520
itself in

2286
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:31,040
Mumbai data how would you now they have

2287
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,920
made a real estate strategy which is

2288
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:36,960
interesting so they they are doing 70

2289
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,880
80% of the stores in high streets. Okay.

2290
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,199
They are not doing in malls. They build

2291
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,000
the store facade will build the brand.

2292
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:46,080
So they are building very interesting

2293
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,840
facads, glass facads. The store which is

2294
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:50,159
visible whenever you pass by. So they

2295
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,880
are building a holding along with the

2296
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:54,560
brand which is a very smart strategy. So

2297
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,920
they built a new interesting real estate

2298
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,679
strategy which is not dependent on

2299
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,719
malls. But Westside is always like that.

2300
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:03,600
No sir. Westside was in malls much much

2301
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,520
more than what Zio is. Judio standalone.

2302
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,520
Studio standalone is much much they are

2303
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:11,040
they have stores in malls but malls is

2304
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:12,719
not their core strategy. But isn't like

2305
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,239
mall

2306
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,800
but aren't malls a more convenient

2307
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:19,520
strategy? Mall cost of doing business

2308
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:23,719
becomes high because of the common area

2309
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:26,000
maintenance. Got it. If you were

2310
01:32:23,719 --> 01:32:27,840
to if you were to explain the difference

2311
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,920
between the real estate cost of a mall

2312
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,639
versus a standalone store what would

2313
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,880
that be sir? I

2314
01:32:31,639 --> 01:32:34,880
think I

2315
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:44,880
think basic difference plus I think uh

2316
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,040
in a standalone you might get a property

2317
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,800
20 25% cheaper the cost difference can

2318
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:55,920
be to the extent of depending 25 to 50%.

2319
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,920
25 to 50% depending how should a brand

2320
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:01,600
decide he's depending on the mall to

2321
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,520
pull in customers for you. That's where

2322
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,600
the cost of acquiring a customer comes

2323
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,920
down in a mall. Sir, how should an

2324
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:10,560
entrepreneur choose between getting into

2325
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,960
a mall or putting up a standalone store?

2326
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,960
I think

2327
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:28,360
stand they will be seeing your product

2328
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:30,400
your brand you get customer

2329
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:32,400
acquisition and Mumbai do you think

2330
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,480
traffic plays an important role

2331
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:37,040
everywhere it plays a roa because in

2332
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:39,600
Mumbai more often than not I would

2333
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:41,040
rather get into a mall than getting into

2334
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,280
a standalone store merely because of

2335
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,719
parking.

2336
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,320
I think everything makes a difference

2337
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,080
today.

2338
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,760
So as an entrepreneur, what would be the

2339
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,679
four or five checkpoints that you need

2340
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,199
to consider before choosing between a

2341
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,880
mall and a standalone store? I think you

2342
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:56,920
should try both. You'll come to know.

2343
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:00,000
Secondly, brand uh once your brand

2344
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:02,880
becomes I would rather use a mix of

2345
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,760
strategy of standalone and molds. Okay.

2346
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:08,400
So you're saying which malls standalone.

2347
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:10,159
Okay.

2348
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,320
malls like if you look at the new brand

2349
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:14,159
which has come about in clothing now

2350
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,960
that is a snitch there is a newi numei

2351
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:19,280
has a strategy of malls snitch has

2352
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:22,280
opened some standalones also and they

2353
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:24,639
are in malls also so I think everybody's

2354
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:28,679
experimenting and while a new brand is

2355
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:32,840
being built but I think new brand online

2356
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:35,760
build and standalone experiment because

2357
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:37,199
malls have a role to play but all can't

2358
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:42,239
deliver you the

2359
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:42,239
output. Why not? Malls

2360
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:48,639
locations

2361
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,320
mixate depend. So, so you're saying that

2362
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:52,880
you need to consider the tenant mix, the

2363
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:55,120
location of the mall, the cost, and your

2364
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:58,560
brand. Yeah.

2365
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,560
and your long-term vision of your

2366
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,080
brand because your customer is passing

2367
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:08,400
through that place and seeing your brand

2368
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,400
every

2369
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:14,480
day and you will not be able to take a

2370
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:16,480
big place or show a facade, show the

2371
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:19,679
brand personality in full. If you were

2372
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,600
to if you were to break down the most

2373
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,639
powerful attributes of big bazar that

2374
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,360
turned it into a successful

2375
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:27,199
organization, it cannot be just real

2376
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,400
estate. You did several things, right? I

2377
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:30,080
think a lot of five elements have to

2378
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,280
come together. Which are those five

2379
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:34,360
elements? I would say

2380
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:37,840
product,

2381
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:39,840
pricing, the promotions which we did,

2382
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,679
the vibe and the environment which we

2383
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,400
create the hustle and bustle please. And

2384
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:46,320
fifth is the energy and the

2385
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,840
team people.

2386
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,920
When it comes to product, I understand

2387
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:53,440
this to be I think we played a lot in

2388
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,440
category. What do you mean by

2389
01:35:54,679 --> 01:35:59,280
that? We virtually worked on creating

2390
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:12,440
categories because we were the phase

2391
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:12,440
when we transitioned from washing

2392
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:17,600
to what you call the soap soap. Yeah.

2393
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:24,960
Soap participate. So how did you

2394
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,320
effectively transition a customer? I

2395
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:30,199
think you have to create that category,

2396
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:33,199
talk about it, makes make

2397
01:36:30,199 --> 01:36:34,560
noise, create events around it and do

2398
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,600
all that things. Yeah. Walk me through

2399
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,960
one example.

2400
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:44,159
I think I remember uh like

2401
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:47,040
uh I would say soaps as a category uh

2402
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:47,040
premiumization of

2403
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:05,440
soaps. Can you go deeper into this sir?

2404
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,199
I don't remember the category but

2405
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,360
luggage as a category I remember how we

2406
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:10,600
created it luggage we identified a big

2407
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:14,000
insight

2408
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:17,000
luggage set during weddings

2409
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
set.

2410
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:48,719
We virtually created this category. But

2411
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:52,040
how did you collect this data from the

2412
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,040
ground? I think

2413
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,800
but so this has to travel from your

2414
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,080
ground staff all the way to the

2415
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,560
management. I think this is our life

2416
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:00,639
incidences also. If you are a observer

2417
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,080
of society, if you are keeping your eyes

2418
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,800
and ears open, you will keep on knowing

2419
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,239
this. You don't need big great level of

2420
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,159
ground research to do all these things.

2421
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:13,040
Yeah. And any category creation when I

2422
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:13,040
remember when VHS player came about, DVD

2423
01:38:13,719 --> 01:38:20,600
players at a particular price point, we

2424
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,600
had a particular metal bed

2425
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:33,440
bad all this category

2426
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:35,520
creation from one product to another

2427
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:37,520
upgradation. I think that's where we

2428
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,679
played a role. Got it. So I am looking

2429
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,119
at this as a framework and if I have to

2430
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:43,760
understand how did your think tank

2431
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:45,119
operate so at the grassroot level you

2432
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,560
identified what exactly is the customer

2433
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:52,639
using right now. Then you look

2434
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:52,639
at okay because I'm not able to

2435
01:38:54,119 --> 01:38:58,159
understand from 16 17 years we have been

2436
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,639
doing maybe now it's 20 years we have

2437
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:02,880
been doing a project called bat dashan

2438
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:05,679
wherein our team stays in particular

2439
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:08,320
towns and uh villages and we observe the

2440
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:10,800
societal change from what we saw last

2441
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:12,719
and whatever we are hearing. So we have

2442
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,320
observed the change of the girl child

2443
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:17,119
getting importance which imple which

2444
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,880
which influenced all our addition we

2445
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:20,960
started sponsoring miss India after that

2446
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:23,920
we we went into women's wear in a very

2447
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,119
significant way we invested in ba and at

2448
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:29,199
that point of time the woman as a

2449
01:39:26,119 --> 01:39:31,360
category invest just to understand from

2450
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:33,600
a societal trend which picked up Indian

2451
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:36,320
society woman is now getting respect

2452
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,159
even in Hana Rajasthan everywhere I

2453
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:41,920
think that changed our approach to

2454
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:43,760
business also we saw a a societal trend

2455
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:47,840
that every small town may English

2456
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:50,560
speaking classes are coming like crazy.

2457
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,719
So that aspiration of learning English

2458
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,360
was another societal trend which we

2459
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:58,239
realized as a then we recognized the

2460
01:39:55,360 --> 01:40:00,880
role of uh the society parent how does

2461
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:03,679
the family functions what is the

2462
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:06,600
relation between the son and a father

2463
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:08,880
the father uh and a daughter

2464
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,880
relationship I think this relationship

2465
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,639
tells us about how the society functions

2466
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,480
and how does how did that insight create

2467
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:17,520
a business opportunity for you I think

2468
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:19,119
it you it helps us in communication

2469
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,800
What kind of communication you have to

2470
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:23,280
do which will appeal like the role model

2471
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,840
communication and in this case if I were

2472
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:27,119
to understand which product did you sell

2473
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:29,040
because of understanding this

2474
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:31,560
communication I think when we started

2475
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,400
big bazar we knew that the

2476
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:37,440
kitchen is with the mother-in-law

2477
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:40,560
correct and we have to convince her and

2478
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:43,360
daughter-in-law convince societal change

2479
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:45,119
told us that we used to get we used to

2480
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:48,400
if you look at bodar images you will

2481
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:50,719
always see woman shopping with a child

2482
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:53,520
in the trolley and a very happy feeling.

2483
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:56,880
Then we started showing a mother-in-law

2484
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,880
in the images,

2485
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:02,080
daughter-in-law imaging. So what neuro

2486
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,760
images you throw out is also very

2487
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,480
important. Whom are you talking to is

2488
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:09,040
very important. So this societal

2489
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:10,719
observation tells you a story around how

2490
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,719
what kind of people what kind of

2491
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:16,480
communication what should you do.

2492
01:41:13,719 --> 01:41:19,040
Wow. Beautiful insider. So you are

2493
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:20,960
saying I'll give you an example and you

2494
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,760
tell me if I'm getting it right. Let's

2495
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,320
talk about Netflix. When HBO and Netflix

2496
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:28,080
went headon, HBO was under the

2497
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,880
assumption that the father is going to

2498
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:33,119
decide what is going to be watched by

2499
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,400
the family. As in the subscription,

2500
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:36,639
which subscription are we going to buy

2501
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:38,400
was decided by the father. Netflix

2502
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:40,800
realized that there is a societal norm

2503
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:43,440
that's coming up whereby the CTO of the

2504
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,119
house is actually the younger son. So if

2505
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,119
the younger son decides that we should

2506
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:48,800
subscribe to Netflix and Amazon Prime

2507
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:50,719
then the house will eventually subscribe

2508
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,679
to Netflix and Amazon Prime instead of

2509
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:55,840
competing with HBO to strike resonance

2510
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:58,080
with the fathers they struck resonance

2511
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,000
with the next generation and that is how

2512
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,080
they became relevant and eventually when

2513
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,960
this generation grew up Netflix and

2514
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:09,480
Amazon Prime went mainstream. So the

2515
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:12,080
story of the CTO now

2516
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:14,719
emerging. So the story of now the son

2517
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:17,920
emerging as the CTO was the societal

2518
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:20,800
truth which they banged on to create

2519
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:23,280
neuroimage of all kids and young people

2520
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:26,560
watching Netflix and Netflix and chill

2521
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:28,639
became a Gen Z concept and when they

2522
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,920
eventually became the deciders of what

2523
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,280
needs to be watched the entire house

2524
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,280
started watching Netflix and that's how

2525
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:35,040
Netflix achieved penetration. Would this

2526
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,600
be a good application? Absolutely

2527
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:39,679
correct. But once you then we decided

2528
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,080
the mother-in-law joint family system

2529
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:43,600
was breaking down nuclear families in

2530
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,520
urban centers. So it became nuclear

2531
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:48,719
families. So our communication in urban

2532
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:52,320
centers totally changed to the the the

2533
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:54,719
son and the wife and the children in our

2534
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:57,440
communication. The the towns and the

2535
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:59,600
smaller towns we the power was still

2536
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:01,040
with the mother-in-law. Okay. And it was

2537
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,760
very interesting when we realized that

2538
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:07,119
the m the daughter used to take advice

2539
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:09,199
from her mother and they might be in

2540
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:12,719
separate towns or where to shop their

2541
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:14,159
grocery from because the mother daughter

2542
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,159
is married and she's moved to another

2543
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:17,920
town and that's where big brother used

2544
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:20,719
to play a lot of role in terms of how do

2545
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:23,400
we get her daughter to shop with us. How

2546
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:27,440
did you do this sir? I think it's subtle

2547
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:27,440
communication. I think mother and

2548
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:38,600
daughters this is one combination we

2549
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:41,040
always look

2550
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:44,000
at and how do the store managers use

2551
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,000
that data to generate

2552
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:47,360
sales

2553
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:55,600
soft what are the profile of customers

2554
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,880
what what combination they're coming in.

2555
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,480
People don't show up alone in this

2556
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,840
country as much. So I'll give you one

2557
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:02,159
example and again you tell me if this is

2558
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:04,320
a good application. When I went to buy

2559
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:07,119
my first car, I was the one buying the

2560
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,719
car but the salesman did not pay heed to

2561
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:11,600
me at all. He was talking to my father

2562
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:13,760
only because I'm assuming that he's he's

2563
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,960
been told the story that fathers are

2564
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:17,760
eventually going to decide. He's not

2565
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:19,600
changed. That salesman has not changed.

2566
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,960
Got it. So I would rather now look at

2567
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:24,360
the younger generation deciding

2568
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:27,040
everything. be power lies not with

2569
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:29,520
the parent as much as what it lies

2570
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:32,239
because it's a very democratic set of uh

2571
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:34,400
consumers. Now my children are born to a

2572
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:37,440
democratic parent. They have they can

2573
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:39,000
influence me now and our grandchildren

2574
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:41,840
can influence

2575
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,239
anybody. So and secondly the society

2576
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:45,920
this new society is of born in

2577
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:47,520
abundance.

2578
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,760
Beautiful. So what you're saying is your

2579
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,239
brand story and brand communication has

2580
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:54,400
to fundamentally stem from a societal

2581
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:56,239
truth and in this case you'll have to

2582
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:58,000
understand the family properly to

2583
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:00,159
understand each person's role to then

2584
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,040
understand who should you talk to and

2585
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:04,400
who should you convince to drive

2586
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:05,760
sales. Okay, one example of that was

2587
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:08,239
Netflix. The other example is the one

2588
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:10,080
that I gave you for a car salesman. And

2589
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:12,000
because this cars I'm trying to imagine

2590
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:14,639
the impact of this like if there's a

2591
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,280
brief that comes out from MG and BMW and

2592
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:19,440
all these automotive companies to their

2593
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:21,119
stores that you need to go and target

2594
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:23,600
the youngest person who's visiting the

2595
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:26,800
store that will actually change the game

2596
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:28,400
altogether because if the younger person

2597
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,639
I mean in this case the son is the

2598
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,320
decider of which car to buy and the

2599
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:35,199
salesman puts in efforts to convince the

2600
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:37,440
father and eventually when when this

2601
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:38,880
family goes on to a different store and

2602
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:40,239
let's Say the Mercedes guy tries to

2603
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,320
convince the son and the son is

2604
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:45,199
convinced the son will actually change

2605
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:47,920
the decision of the father to go from

2606
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:50,080
buying BMW to buying Mercedes and when

2607
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,159
this happens at scale it's a billion

2608
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,480
dollar opportunity. Yeah, but that's the

2609
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:56,480
way if you look at the you know cinemas

2610
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:58,119
reflect this very well. There was a

2611
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:01,400
cinema

2612
01:45:58,119 --> 01:46:04,639
called there was a parent that Amirish

2613
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:06,880
Puri and who was the head and the

2614
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:09,400
authority of the family. In the last

2615
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:13,280
scene he says

2616
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:15,119
Simani. So he succumbed but there was a

2617
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,920
fight for that and that fight was what

2618
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:20,480
people loved the generational fight.

2619
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:22,719
That movie worked so well on that

2620
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:24,800
generational fight that I don't want to

2621
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:28,000
leave away tradition. I don't want to

2622
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:30,400
run away. I would love to convince. And

2623
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,560
the villain was the father and he

2624
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:35,040
succumbs to his daughter. I think that

2625
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,880
was the game-changing movie to see the

2626
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,880
change of society which happened.

2627
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:41,000
Beautiful. In fact, sir, when I was

2628
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,960
watching the Netflix

2629
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,199
documentary on I think it's called

2630
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,040
Romantics. Romantics Chopraas. Yeah.

2631
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:49,199
There I think Adita Chopra mentioned

2632
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:52,560
this. He said that the reason why DDLJ

2633
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:56,080
worked very well was not because of the

2634
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:58,040
story but the encapsulation of all the

2635
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:00,800
characters in the story which exactly

2636
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:03,119
reflected what parents wanted and what

2637
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,600
the kids wanted. The kids got the the

2638
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:07,520
the the children got what they wanted

2639
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,800
which is the love of their life and the

2640
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:12,159
parents got what they wanted which is

2641
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:15,520
respect and eventually everybody's

2642
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:16,880
happy. So it was a win-win both. That is

2643
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,320
what Indian society is all about. If

2644
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,920
you're talking of societal truth that

2645
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:23,199
was a reflection of societal truth.

2646
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,639
Yeah. Likewise Santosh my colleague he

2647
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:26,880
has coined a very interesting word of

2648
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:29,840
modernity. He says modernity in India is

2649
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:32,400
negotiated tradition. Modernity in India

2650
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:35,040
is is equal to negotiated tradition.

2651
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:37,480
Okay. We we negotiate without tradition.

2652
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:40,719
We'll still play garba but on a disco

2653
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,239
music. So we will never leave our roots

2654
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,239
but we'll adopt to anything which is

2655
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:46,639
modern. As a brand how can you leverage

2656
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:49,760
this? Can you give me an example? Let's

2657
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:52,000
take the example of ethnic wear. How can

2658
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:53,920
an ethnic wear brand leverage the

2659
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,080
societal truth to strike resonance with

2660
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,080
their customers? I think ethnic wear is

2661
01:47:56,080 --> 01:48:00,239
a big sufferer if you ask me because we

2662
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:03,280
were part of the BBA story to a certain

2663
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:05,520
extent. uh we had a huge clothing brand

2664
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:08,800
called 60 which was a,000 cr plus brand

2665
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:11,760
and we were into multiple I believe the

2666
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:14,000
brand players on the ethnic wear is not

2667
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:17,679
playing smart enough to make their

2668
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:20,000
relevance uh permanent in a way okay and

2669
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:22,000
uh I think there is a work to be done

2670
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,760
there where where are they going wrong

2671
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,480
sir I think they're not fighting with

2672
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:28,000
the new

2673
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:29,520
uh I would say the new imaging which is

2674
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:33,119
coming about they have not played

2675
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:36,239
anything Well, to make their uh ethnic

2676
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:38,080
wear survive in in whichever form they

2677
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:39,600
have to mo they have to get into

2678
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,040
something but nobody's working hard on

2679
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,639
that like can you give me a stark

2680
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,159
example what are the brands doing right

2681
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:46,800
now and what should they be doing I

2682
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,800
think ethnic

2683
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:57,760
branding this category will

2684
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:59,760
die this category is getting attacked

2685
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:03,199
from everywhere and they are not working

2686
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:04,800
hard enough to protect this category.

2687
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,400
And if you were to be an ethnic wear

2688
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,560
entrepreneur today, what would you do

2689
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,199
now? I would do I would I will create

2690
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,280
new products, new style, new imagination

2691
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:17,840
getting new set of influencers and

2692
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:19,679
getting in this as something which we as

2693
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,679
a I think it's you have to talk about

2694
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:24,719
the virtues and the personalities and

2695
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:27,280
create fashion around it and create and

2696
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:30,080
imaging around it which makes people

2697
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:32,480
feel that those who are wearing this are

2698
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:34,719
the the people. What image would you

2699
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,239
create right now? It has to be around

2700
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:39,800
fashion and it has to be around the

2701
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:43,199
society in some way

2702
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:43,199
like yeah

2703
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:48,719
maybe understood. Got it. So now I want

2704
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:50,320
to come back to big bazar and I

2705
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:52,719
understood one very important lesson

2706
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:54,560
over here that you understood the family

2707
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:56,480
persona. Now it's no longer a customer

2708
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:59,040
persona. understood family portion very

2709
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:01,840
well which then helped you generate

2710
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:03,600
sales in places where it was quite

2711
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,199
counterintuitive to generate sales

2712
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:07,199
because while most people would think

2713
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:08,639
discounts alone will work you understood

2714
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:11,040
the story of the customer which enabled

2715
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:12,480
you to scale up very very quickly. Now

2716
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,960
sir when you were scaling up very very

2717
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:16,560
quickly what would you say were the

2718
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:19,679
mistakes that you made which nobody else

2719
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:22,480
should repeat? I think I always believe

2720
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:25,719
that in hindsight now when I look back

2721
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:29,760
uh since uh future group is in a way no

2722
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:32,719
more that uh we didn't uh we were more

2723
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:35,040
in creation rather than in optimization.

2724
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:36,480
I when I meet the new age entrepreneurs

2725
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,239
I learn something I've learned something

2726
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:40,080
from them is they are great optimizers.

2727
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:42,520
They come from engineering background.

2728
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:44,880
They optimize for

2729
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:47,040
everything. Had we got that kind of

2730
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,360
talent of optimizing like the models

2731
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:50,880
which we build were

2732
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:53,119
unbelievable. We had the we had a great

2733
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,800
team. We had the ability to pivot. We

2734
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:56,639
had the we had the flexibility. We were

2735
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:58,639
not a rigid organization. We had every

2736
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:01,280
quality what a modern organization

2737
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:04,239
should have and we could grow. We could

2738
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:07,520
manage change. We had a great uh people

2739
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:08,480
policy as such. We enjoyed creation. I

2740
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,639
think we should have enjoyed

2741
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:13,360
optimization also. Can you give me an

2742
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:15,480
example? I I I think optimization means

2743
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:17,639
uh you have a retail

2744
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:20,239
space

2745
01:51:17,639 --> 01:51:23,280
cost. Now how do we optimize for every

2746
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:25,119
inch of square foot? How do we optimize

2747
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:27,040
on margins and keep on increasing it?

2748
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:29,760
How do we optimize for another income?

2749
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:32,080
How do we optimize for cost? How do we

2750
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:33,600
look at each and every line item of cost

2751
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,880
and kept? There has to be a parallel

2752
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:37,119
organization which is optimizing

2753
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,960
everything what you are doing. Basically

2754
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:40,400
good

2755
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:44,000
frugality. I think it's much much beyond

2756
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:46,800
that today's uh with today data being

2757
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,159
available and the kind of uh engineering

2758
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,239
mindset which you can build in an

2759
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:53,440
organization you can optimize like the

2760
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:55,360
new age companies like uh I would say

2761
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,040
the zepptos and the blinkets they are

2762
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:59,119
unbelievable optimizer because they have

2763
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:01,119
to deliver in 10 minutes they have to

2764
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:02,800
work on that speed they have to earn

2765
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:05,520
that margin the optimizing that what

2766
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:07,840
they are doing I think that theory if

2767
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,199
you could have brought in earlier it

2768
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,800
would have been a different different

2769
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:12,000
world only. So the message to all the

2770
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,599
entrepreneurs is that no matter what

2771
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,199
you're doing, you could be doing great

2772
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:16,639
work but you have to optimize it to an

2773
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:19,360
extent where it is super efficient. No,

2774
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:21,599
I have a view that don't get excited

2775
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:24,480
with your successes. Your optimization

2776
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:26,880
is ultimately the winning point. Nothing

2777
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:28,159
else matters. You'll be good at

2778
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,920
everything. Your top line will be

2779
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:33,760
fantastic. You might be earning but

2780
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:36,719
optim you optimize to the bottomest of

2781
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:40,480
rupee bottom of P. Just say if we have a

2782
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:42,800
clothing brand if they have a wastage of

2783
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,400
2%. They should bring it down to 1%.

2784
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,920
Maybe maybe lower than that also.

2785
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,840
Optimizing not only to that extent

2786
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,840
optimizing to speed how much of stock

2787
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:53,679
turns you are doing. Optimize to every

2788
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:55,520
SKU level how much fast it is selling at

2789
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:57,920
this quantity of production how much

2790
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:01,320
cost you can bring down. Optimizing to

2791
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:04,639
every SKU optimizing to every point is

2792
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:04,639
optimization. I

2793
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:12,400
think now data can be looked from one

2794
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:14,159
product. So how do you optimize on every

2795
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,119
account? Optimize your every

2796
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:19,040
communication optimize every real

2797
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:21,119
optimization is a subject how it can be

2798
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:23,599
brought into the organization. Got it.

2799
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:25,760
So that's one. Number two would be I

2800
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:28,080
think only one thing optimiz only

2801
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,719
optimize. Then secondly

2802
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:33,520
uh balance sheet. M balance sheet is

2803
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:35,760
everything not your P&L. M so in your

2804
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,119
case from my research I understood that

2805
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,880
you had very high debt.

2806
01:53:38,119 --> 01:53:42,159
Now in business you eventually have to

2807
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,320
take up debt if you want to do something

2808
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:45,360
of that scale. But what is the

2809
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,199
difference between good debt and bad

2810
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:50,800
debt? How do you assess it? I think that

2811
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:53,119
is a debt only. That is a burden and uh

2812
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,199
debt is all you know the problem in debt

2813
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:57,840
what happens is debt once it comes in

2814
01:53:55,199 --> 01:54:01,040
your balance sheet again and again you

2815
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:03,440
are when it is going to be paid how does

2816
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:06,280
your business is going to repay debt

2817
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:08,639
your businesses are created to service

2818
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:11,360
debt not to repay debt I think we have

2819
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:12,960
to create businesses to repay debt can

2820
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,719
you give me can you can you give me an

2821
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,480
example of this s because I understood

2822
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:18,239
what I said I understood what you said

2823
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:19,679
but I want to make sure that everybody

2824
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:22,480
Nobody else also understands in a more

2825
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:24,320
simpler manner. So business may the

2826
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:26,000
banks when they are giving you loan they

2827
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:28,239
look at the service coverage ratio

2828
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,480
whether you'll be able to service debt

2829
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:32,400
they have some formulas in which but

2830
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:34,880
then you keep on growing business sir

2831
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:37,760
debt service you speaking about when you

2832
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,840
take up debt the banks look at DSCR the

2833
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:43,920
debt service ratio coverage ratios and

2834
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:46,159
all and we keep on growing actually the

2835
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:48,719
model of giving that or servicing that

2836
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:50,320
was not built on uh growth as much it

2837
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:53,520
was a factory-driven environment you're

2838
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:56,320
putting up a factory factory retail

2839
01:54:53,520 --> 01:55:00,320
businesses like we must have compounded

2840
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:04,080
for multiple years at around 27 28%.

2841
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:05,920
Growth was inbuilt in our business. So

2842
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:08,159
secondly we had no other means equity

2843
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,639
was blocked because FDI was not allowed

2844
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:14,639
in retail. So we were working with lot

2845
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:16,480
of limitations and growth and people

2846
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:18,960
were consumers were liking on whatever

2847
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:22,440
we were growing. So that was the way of

2848
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:25,119
growth and probably and when COVID came

2849
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:26,960
in we were the first who were impacted

2850
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:29,440
the most because 65% of our business

2851
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:31,040
were in malls correct so there was no

2852
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:33,199
way out and they were the last to open

2853
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:35,840
up and then the society I think the

2854
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:38,080
habits a lot of things changed so we had

2855
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:40,800
no other option but to sell out so that

2856
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,800
everything could get

2857
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:47,840
clear so life became very different what

2858
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:48,960
what exactly was that all about s

2859
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,520
because it never we never really

2860
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:54,760
understood what is it is the matter is

2861
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:58,760
legally subjudicious in a way that uh we

2862
01:55:54,760 --> 01:56:02,520
Amazon had invested in our parent

2863
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:05,760
company through which uh

2864
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:08,719
uh we were to be along with them in

2865
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:12,159
terms of they'll help us and we will be

2866
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:13,679
able to solve nothing happened and uh we

2867
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:16,119
had no other option to sell they

2868
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:19,080
objected to our selling

2869
01:56:16,119 --> 01:56:22,239
M and

2870
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:23,679
uh we had found out a solution

2871
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:26,000
everything was getting cleared up and

2872
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:29,040
everything would have survived but

2873
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,320
somehow they told it then things didn't

2874
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:32,400
happen the way it should have happened

2875
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:34,480
and things came to a stand. My last two

2876
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:36,880
questions are about the next generation.

2877
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:38,560
You've been such a stark observer of the

2878
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,440
societal norms and what is changing and

2879
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:42,320
what is not changing. When it comes to

2880
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,599
genzes what are the strengths and

2881
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:45,679
weaknesses that you see in the upcoming

2882
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:47,679
generation?

2883
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:51,599
I'm very fascinated by this generation

2884
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:53,960
because they are uh when I look at uh

2885
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:56,719
people who are born in a very abundant

2886
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:59,040
environment coming from urban towns or

2887
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:01,920
very towns like Mumbai and all they are

2888
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:03,840
very different than the people who are

2889
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:07,199
coming from smaller towns still in

2890
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:09,520
abundance but the hunger is different

2891
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:11,560
the understanding of life is different

2892
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,239
the understanding of lifestyle is

2893
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:17,199
different and I'm finding a lot of new

2894
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:20,159
entrepreneurs uh very very fascinating

2895
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:22,000
that uh they have formed a view which is

2896
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:25,040
very different and contrary to the view

2897
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:28,719
which we have been born up with. So we

2898
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:32,719
are finding a mix of things but but very

2899
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:35,520
good energy very good knowledge and and

2900
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:37,040
zeal and passion to do something and

2901
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:39,280
where are the problems which I think the

2902
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:41,360
biggest problem which I find in them is

2903
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:43,599
one that they want all want to start

2904
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:45,199
from a problem statement. M what do you

2905
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:47,199
mean by that they say there was this

2906
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:49,119
problem and we want to solve this but

2907
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:50,320
that's a good thing no I don't think so

2908
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:53,440
there's any problem firstly

2909
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:53,440
fundamentally okay

2910
01:57:54,679 --> 01:57:59,440
you problem I think problem to start on

2911
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:01,639
a problem and solving that I think it's

2912
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:04,239
a Californian way of looking at a

2913
01:58:01,639 --> 01:58:05,599
business so but how do you go about

2914
01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:06,800
building a business because we've always

2915
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,239
been told that you need to look at a

2916
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,920
problem and then build a business I

2917
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:13,159
don't know I I have never thought that

2918
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:13,159
way problem

2919
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:17,199
problem I don't understand

2920
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:23,760
problem now these are new created

2921
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,280
problems first marketing is all about

2922
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,119
creating a problem and creating a

2923
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,440
solution for it so then tell us that

2924
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:30,800
you're doing this currently there's no

2925
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,960
problem you are saying that I'll create

2926
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:34,880
this problem and solve it that still is

2927
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,760
a business model

2928
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:40,159
got it I think they start on a point

2929
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,520
which is solving a problem which I don't

2930
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:43,199
subscribe to as much but what do you

2931
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:45,599
think they should do. They say we'll

2932
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:47,360
create this problem and we'll solve it.

2933
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:49,440
So you're saying being open being more

2934
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:51,119
self-aware. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. They're

2935
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:52,880
not solving any problem. That is the

2936
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:54,320
first thing. So but do you think they

2937
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:58,159
should actually figure out a problem and

2938
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:59,599
solve it? I don't know. World problem.

2939
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:01,119
For example, business education in India

2940
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:02,639
is a big problem. We want to solve. I

2941
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:04,639
know I have a different view. I believe

2942
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:07,440
that the society is changing. The newer

2943
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,719
generation wants to consume not the way

2944
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:10,400
their parents consume. They are

2945
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,480
rebelling in consumption. Now we

2946
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:14,880
rebelled in terms of the way we approach

2947
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:17,360
the society and the societal norms. We

2948
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,480
rebelled against that. The new the new

2949
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,760
generation is rebelling in the

2950
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:21,520
consumption. They don't want to consume

2951
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:23,280
what their parents consume. That is

2952
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,440
their way of showing rebellion. Be a

2953
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:27,199
part of that consumption. That's not

2954
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:28,400
solving a problem. You are participating

2955
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:30,320
in the new consumption which is

2956
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:32,560
happening. You are participating in the

2957
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:34,000
rebellion of the new consumer. And

2958
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:36,560
attitude wise, do you see a problem with

2959
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,719
the genesis?

2960
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:40,239
I don't know. I I don't think so. I I

2961
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:43,199
believe that every generation has to be

2962
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:45,440
different. Correct. We can't be clones

2963
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:46,960
of the previous generation and luckily

2964
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:48,639
it's not happening because we're seeing

2965
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:50,560
a lot of reports which say that Jenzies

2966
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:53,119
often have a lack of commitment. Instant

2967
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,639
gratit. You don't think so? I don't

2968
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:56,159
think so. They are born in a different

2969
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:58,000
environment. They are consuming

2970
01:59:56,159 --> 02:00:00,800
different content. They are consuming

2971
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:03,119
much much more than what we consume.

2972
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,880
It's a new way of living. Because to me

2973
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:07,760
because I'm a part of this generation I

2974
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:10,480
understand that not to be lack of

2975
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:12,080
commitment but the desire for change and

2976
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:15,840
the desire for upgradation very very

2977
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:15,840
quickly which is a good thing. I

2978
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:22,199
think but how does it matter? I think

2979
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:24,880
their respect for the society still

2980
02:00:22,199 --> 02:00:27,880
remains their commitment to life still

2981
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:29,960
remains. nervous no emotions they go

2982
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:32,239
through

2983
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:33,599
music life doesn't change much here

2984
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:37,280
human beings are human beings they have

2985
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:39,119
the same greed hunger passion energy I

2986
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:40,560
think what they consuming is changing

2987
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:42,960
the way they are consuming is changing

2988
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:45,199
the delivery formats are changing but

2989
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:48,080
same year they are adding more

2990
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:49,199
supplements to their food correct so

2991
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,800
there is something which is getting

2992
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:53,199
added up in there but that's the way

2993
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:55,520
society is going to be

2994
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:57,119
beautiful sir thank you so much for

2995
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,280
spending spending so much time with us.

2996
02:00:57,119 --> 02:01:03,199
It was it was amazing.

2997
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:04,320
Sir and you told me one thing that busy

2998
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:06,800
founders are never great and great

2999
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:09,440
founders are never busy. I executed that

3000
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:11,840
in the next 12 months and today we are

3001
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:14,000
far far better as compared to where we

3002
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:15,840
were back then. And because of you, I

3003
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,880
learned to build systems so that I can

3004
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:20,400
spend time thinking and focusing on

3005
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,760
strategy rather than just being very

3006
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,400
very tactical. So I have a very

3007
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:27,199
interesting theory on business. uh yeah

3008
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:28,880
business has to start with strategy then

3009
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:31,040
is designing how do you organize

3010
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,239
yourself to work on that strategy how do

3011
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:33,520
you design your business how do you

3012
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:36,320
design your organization design your

3013
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:38,239
products third is execution what I'm

3014
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:39,520
finding the biggest problem in today's

3015
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:42,080
generation is they are straight away

3016
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:44,080
getting into execution

3017
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:48,400
strategy is less than execution is more

3018
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:48,400
strategy design is the most important

3019
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,360
thing but how you design your life

3020
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:53,360
around

3021
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:58,480
execution. Everybody in the new

3022
02:01:55,920 --> 02:02:00,800
generation is trained for execution.

3023
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:02,080
Sir, what would be the three books that

3024
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,440
you would recommend to the next

3025
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:05,920
generation so that they can learn this?

3026
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:08,719
I'm a I'm I can tell you what podcast to

3027
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:10,639
watch now. But I think one book lately

3028
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:14,040
which influenced me the most was 0ero to

02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:16,800

02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,119
money soul. It's called soul of money

3033
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:25,760
only. Yeah. Okay. What is this about?

3034
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:27,520
It's all about money. What is the power

3035
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:30,560
of money?

3036
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:32,000
Money. Power atma.

taste. Very diver. I need that diversity

3047
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:56,480
