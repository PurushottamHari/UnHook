1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,480
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,240
Welcome to Study Gross.  Look,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,480
one after the other bad news is coming

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,279
for India and recently the India-Pakistan

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
war had just ended Operation Sindoor and

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,800
India had defeated Pakistan.  But

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
now we are seeing that China, Pakistan and

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Bangladesh have met each other.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,160
So Beijing has

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:36,800

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,360
organized the first trilateral summit in Cunningham which is in China, we will talk about Chanakya Niti, who is

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,120
considered the master of our foreign affairs.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,040

link is in the comment box.  So friends,

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,520
this is a trilateral summit between Bangladesh, China and Pakistan.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,160
This is a trilateral meet.  Basically,

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,399
all three countries met each other and the

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,559
Foreign Minister of China, Vice

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,520
Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Bank did not

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,240
come but Sun Weidong,

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,680
Acting Foreign Minister Secretary of Bangladesh Rahul

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,000
Alam, Rahul Alam Siddiqui and Foreign

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,280
Secretary of Pakistan Imran Ahmed

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,360
Siddiqui attended the meeting.

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,159
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Anna

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,880
Baloch also

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,080
participated in it through video link, so in a

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,159
way we got to see all this, the inaugural

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,119
meeting took place between Bangladesh, China and Pakistan,

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,520
so what are the interests of the three countries, we will

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,079
discuss each and every thing. Now they have said a lot of

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,320
useless nonsense, but friends,

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,159
forget whatever they have said, this meeting took place in the Convoy

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
City, which is the capital of Southern Yunan

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,360
Province, China's friends, Xi

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,680
Jinping is going to introduce Dalai Lama.  A

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,640
very big move is being made.

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,960
Xi Jinping has met people and he will also

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,520
meet the Dalai Lama.  They will say that it is in our

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,280
control.  Recently American

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,880
officials were seen in Taiwan, so China

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,399
sent planes there.  Well, China just

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,439
keeps on making empty barks.  He will not be able to do anything.

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,599
But this is dangerous.  Is it okay?  So

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,080
what is the problem for China?  China

50
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,480
needs it at all costs.  Firstly, they want the Western Front to

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
not open from their side and

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,840
want to keep America in check.  Now America

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,239
will open the Western Front.  America has opened the Eastern Front.

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,680
China has fallen.

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,080
Every country in this world is already facing two or three front war.

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,000
Remember this, every country, be it

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
Pakistan, China, India

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,080
, America or any other country.  Ok?   It does

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,800
not belong to America because America is

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,959
surrounded by sea.  And it is true that

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
America has no boundaries.  So it

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,879
is the only country and hence it is also a super power.

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Geography plays a big role

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,200
in superpowers.  Is it okay?

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
But if we talk about India,

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,440
Bangladesh, China,

67
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,599

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,360
America has deployed its military everywhere in China and in all the South East Asian nations.

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,760
Their missile systems

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,319
are active there.  America will open the Western Front with the

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,480
help of India and whenever this has

72
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,959
happened, China has waged war.  Otherwise there

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,319
is a conflict.  So China has always had this fear.

74
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,480
Secondly, China's Arunachal

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
Pradesh always calls it South Tibet.  He talks

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,519
nonsense sometimes.  Actually,

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,280
Tibet does not belong to China either.  Tibet brother is a peaceful

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,440
nation.  Tibet has been forcibly occupied.

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
Like some people, some great men were saying that

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
we should not have an army.  Look, it

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,760
is absolutely fine.  There should not be an army.

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,760
But you must understand one thing that you are fine.  We

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
will carry on yoga practice together.  At the same

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,480
time, you also have to show strength.  Through the

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,239
practice of yoga, we have achieved a very high position in the entire world.

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,159
But when the

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,159
attack happened, the attackers did

88
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,840
not see who the Yogi you are, Sadhna Bhai, they had

89
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,920
destroyed Nalanda University.

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,239
Ok?  So understand this that we have to

91
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
make our army very powerful and that is why

92
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,159
today Indian army is the most powerful and

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
no one can mess with us.  We

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,799
are a nuclear power.  No one can mess with us.

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,640
You have to carry religion and strength together.

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,480
So here China

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,599
always misbehaves in Arunachal Pradesh.  Ok

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,280
?  He tells me about South Tibet.  Now China has

99
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,439
built a proper infrastructure across the border.  Made in Tibet.  Everywhere

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
where India's boundary touches, and

102
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
after Ladakh, the conflict that happened with

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,359
Galwan Pangongso,

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
work is progressing at a much faster pace after that.  India is also

105
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,160
working fast.  In Arunachal Pradesh, there are

106
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,520
many things like Sela Pass,

107
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,600
railway lines, roads, widening etc. that are being done and

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,000
I think that India should talk about the Upper Siang Project

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,400
in Arunachal Pradesh.  All the

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
people present here, all the stakeholders,

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
they should be made to sit and be explained that

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,800
this dam is very important

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,720
because it is stuck right now and as

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,840
you know China, Medong is building the biggest dam.

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,919
So,

117
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,800
China has its eyes on Arunachal Pradesh, but most of all,

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:58,479

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,960
China has its eyes on the Siliguri Corridor in the North East.  Here, China

120
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,440
needs Bangladesh, Bhutan

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,759
and Nepal.  This is a

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,160
tri-junction and if China settles there,

123
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
then China will come under control to a large extent

124
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
and India will never allow this to happen.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,160
So that is why

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,919
China basically wants many of the projects in India and after that,

127
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,919
China wants water.

128
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,000
wants water.  Look, there is severe water

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,960
crisis everywhere in China.  The situation in Northern China is

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,120
very bad.  This is what

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,440
Hemant Mishra Sharma had said here that China should

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,440
stop the Brahmaputra.  More than half of the water

133
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,479
comes from India only.  So

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,280
he needs water somewhere.  And if you look everywhere,

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,039
you will find water only, water only, in the entire war.

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
 

137
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,360
So these are the interests of China and

138
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
after that China wants to build these two corridors, CPEC and SIMAC,

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,199
for its own interests so that the energy consumption can be reduced.  Then

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,840
China is here and it controls any insurgency that occurs from here.

142
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,240

143
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,960
Controls Uighur Muslims.  Ok

144
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,199
?  Controls ETEM.

145
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,560
It controls the East Turkmenistan Movement.  So

146
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,199
that is why China wants

147
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,840
to bring Bangladesh and

148
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,840
Pakistan together by hook or by crook and

149
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,479
Afghanistan, now see, a similar summit was held

150
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,960
in Afghanistan, the same was organised for CPK, China

151
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,120

152
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
diverted CPK from Afghanistan, CPK will never be completed from Pakistan, so

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,960

154
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,720
preparations are on to divert it from Afghanistan, friends, more than 10 years have

155
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,639
passed for CPK, nothing has happened,

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,600
nothing and now I am writing this to you,

157
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,000
CPK, any corridor of China

158
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,600
can never be completed, it will never happen, forget it,

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,039
China is trapped by investing so much money of 65

160
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,280
billion dollars, now see, till now China did

161
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,840
not have Bangladesh, but last August

162
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,919
Bangladesh also joined hands with China,

163
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,639
whatever CIA did, and all this was America's

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,800
game, now Bangladesh is also with China.

165
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,520
Now, brothers of China, the advisors of Bangladesh,

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,759
friends, there is news from three days ago that they

167
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,319
met the ISI, they are continuously facing a huge threat from ISI

168
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
for the Hindu minorities

169
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
here, right,

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,919
this has been going on since last October, ISI is

171
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,000
very active here, Harkat Ansar and all

172
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,680
those who have left out Jashimuddin,

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,639
right, all the Ansarullah Ansarullah,

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,199
they are all working together with the ISI

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,759
and are

176
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,800
spreading instability in Bengal, North East,

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,720
China is giving them money.  You look at China now,

178
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
let me tell you how China is

179
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,960
working.  Is it okay?  Now

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
what did he say?  China is saying that we

181
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,599
will work on cooperation.  Ok?  We

182
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,000
will establish a working group so that

183
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,800
we can come to an understanding

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,199
and all three of us can work together.  And

185
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,880
this is true multilateralism and regionalism.   The

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,360
SEO defense summit is about to take place.

187
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,440
Rajnath Singh will go there and see,

188
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,479
you can do whatever you want.  Tell me, the one who has power is

189
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,639
Alexander.  So Yunus Mohammad Yunus was

190
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,039
also seen with Pakistan.

191
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,599
But now they are saying that whatever we make is

192
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,000
okay?  We will work in agriculture.  We

193
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,720
will work in the trade.  We

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,599
will work in the industry.  Basically, China will

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,319
give the money.  Ok?

196
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,560
China will give lots of money in the name of all these companies.  Whom?

197
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,360
To Pakistan's ISI.  Whom?

198
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,919
To Bangladesh.  And what will they do?  This will

199
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,639
spread instability in India.  Ok?

200
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,360
Isn't it dominance?  Whoever has the power will rule.

201
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,520
All the rules went to hell.  Ok?  Today

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,319
America has power.  That's Trump dictating.  If you want to

203
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,720
surrender then do it.

204
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,440
So what will China do now?  The money will

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,800
come through these sources only.  And as we told you

206
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,800
terrorists are active in Bangladesh.

207
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
ISI is active.  They will

208
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,640
spread instability through the North East.

209
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,240
Murshidabad, Malda are some of the

210
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,399
districts in Bengal where instability will

211
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,279
spread.  It will spread rapidly.

212
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,959
Radicalization will spread and

213
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,080
RNW and our intelligence

214
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,240
agencies have already marked this.

215
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Some riots in India like Sambhal violence took place.

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,120
Right now in Murshidabad violence, ISI

217
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,080
already has a link to it.  This is a completely well thought out

218
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,760
strategy.  Will I get nothing?

219
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,320
Both countries will be ruined.  It is already ruined.

220
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,959
will be totally ruined.  But this

221
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
is the truth.  Ultimate Truth.  So Yunus has

222
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,480
said that before we revive our

223
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,800
links with Pakistan which were related to the 1971 war,

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,320
we will try to revive them. I think

225
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,720
Bangladeshis should understand

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,959
their history and after that, the three countries have

227
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,839
agreed that good

228
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,920
neighbourliness is what we are good neighbours and we will do

229
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
equality, mutual trust, openness and

230
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
inclusiveness.  Sheikh Hasina also

231
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,399
went to China, but China had begged Sheikh Hasina,

232
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,399
so Sheikh Hasina kicked China and came away.

233
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,839
But now Bangladesh is completely

234
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,519
sitting in the lap of China.  Bangladesh

235
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,000
needs money at any cost because

236
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,720
all the businesses in Bangladesh have closed down.  India has also

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,480
tightened its grip.  So nobody is

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
giving money to Bangladesh.  Whatever cotton was

239
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,160
exported is in trouble.  So

240
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,839
Bangladesh needs money at any cost

241
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,839
because a huge

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
crisis has arisen in Bangladesh.  And after that, their

243
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
C-VAC economic

244
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,920
corridor which was built from Myanmar will also not be built.  Because

245
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,680
civil war is going on in Myanmar also.

246
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
Now trade investment, agriculture,

247
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,480
digital economy, environment, protection,

248
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
marine sciences, green infrastructure,

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,399
culture, education, people to people exchange.

250
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,800
All these things have been said.

251
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,040
What will you do in people to people exchange?  They will send those people in the

252
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,440
name of humanitarian.

253
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,600
Like the Insaaniyat Foundation, it belongs to

254
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
Lashkar.  Lashkar Taiba is saying that they will do people to

255
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,680
people exchange.

256
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,720
Brother, this is all a big game.  Countries

257
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,440

258
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,560
use their intelligence agencies to

259
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,240
spread instability in other countries.  This is how the

260
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,839
game goes.  RNA WB is active.   It is

261
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
not that India is not doing anything at all.

262
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,880
But this is dangerous for India.

263
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,880
He needs money for Pakistan at any cost

264
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,480
and he just wants to see the destruction of India.

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,079
Whatever happens, destroy yourself.   It does

266
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
n't make any sense to him.  But India should be

267
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,000
destroyed in every way.  So there is

268
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
another problem in the North East just like there is some problem

269
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,920
in Manipur too, however yesterday very good news came

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,920
that the Indian Government has now started the talks.  The

271
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,279
movement of trade which is the movement of goods

272
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,040
and the movement of people has now started.

273
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,519
Ok?  A suspension of operations SO

274
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,760
agreement is also going to be signed with cookies.

275
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,920
So this is a good thing.  But

276
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,680
still there

277
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,800
is instability in some particular areas of the North East,

278
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,519
especially in Manipur.  So these

279
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,839
vulnerable points, these people can

280
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
utilize them.  So let's see

281
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,279
what happens next.  What do you think, please

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,720
tell me in the comment box.  Be happy,

283
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,720
keep reading.  This is Siddhant signing off.
