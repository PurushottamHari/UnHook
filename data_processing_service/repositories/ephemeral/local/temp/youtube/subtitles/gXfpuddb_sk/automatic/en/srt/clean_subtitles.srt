I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gross.  Look, one after the other bad news is coming for India and recently the India-Pakistan war had just ended Operation Sindoor and India had defeated Pakistan.  But now we are seeing that China, Pakistan and Bangladesh have met each other. So Beijing has organized the first trilateral summit in Cunningham which is in China, we will talk about Chanakya Niti, who is considered the master of our foreign affairs. Acharya Chanakya and Personality Development Combo for both Rs. 500 only. Use Summer Coupon Code.  We have brought an offer for today.  Description link is in the comment box.  So friends, this is a trilateral summit between Bangladesh, China and Pakistan. This is a trilateral meet.  Basically, all three countries met each other and the Foreign Minister of China, Vice Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Bank did not come but Sun Weidong, Acting Foreign Minister Secretary of Bangladesh Rahul Alam, Rahul Alam Siddiqui and Foreign Secretary of Pakistan Imran Ahmed Siddiqui attended the meeting. Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Anna Baloch also participated in it through video link, so in a way we got to see all this, the inaugural meeting took place between Bangladesh, China and Pakistan, so what are the interests of the three countries, we will discuss each and every thing. Now they have said a lot of useless nonsense, but friends, forget whatever they have said, this meeting took place in the Convoy City, which is the capital of Southern Yunan Province, China's friends, Xi Jinping is going to introduce Dalai Lama.  A very big move is being made. Xi Jinping has met people and he will also meet the Dalai Lama.  They will say that it is in our control.  Recently American officials were seen in Taiwan, so China sent planes there.  Well, China just keeps on making empty barks.  He will not be able to do anything. But this is dangerous.  Is it okay?  So what is the problem for China?  China needs it at all costs.  Firstly, they want the Western Front to not open from their side and want to keep America in check.  Now America will open the Western Front.  America has opened the Eastern Front. China has fallen. Every country in this world is already facing two or three front war. Remember this, every country, be it Pakistan, China, India , America or any other country.  Ok?   It does not belong to America because America is surrounded by sea.  And it is true that America has no boundaries.  So it is the only country and hence it is also a super power. Geography plays a big role in superpowers.  Is it okay? But if we talk about India, Bangladesh, China, America has deployed its military everywhere in China and in all the South East Asian nations. Their missile systems are active there.  America will open the Western Front with the help of India and whenever this has happened, China has waged war.  Otherwise there is a conflict.  So China has always had this fear. Secondly, China's Arunachal Pradesh always calls it South Tibet.  He talks nonsense sometimes.  Actually, Tibet does not belong to China either.  Tibet brother is a peaceful nation.  Tibet has been forcibly occupied. Like some people, some great men were saying that we should not have an army.  Look, it is absolutely fine.  There should not be an army. But you must understand one thing that you are fine.  We will carry on yoga practice together.  At the same time, you also have to show strength.  Through the practice of yoga, we have achieved a very high position in the entire world. But when the attack happened, the attackers did not see who the Yogi you are, Sadhna Bhai, they had destroyed Nalanda University. Ok?  So understand this that we have to make our army very powerful and that is why today Indian army is the most powerful and no one can mess with us.  We are a nuclear power.  No one can mess with us. You have to carry religion and strength together. So here China always misbehaves in Arunachal Pradesh.  Ok ?  He tells me about South Tibet.  Now China has built a proper infrastructure across the border.  Made in Tibet.  Everywhere where India's boundary touches, and after Ladakh, the conflict that happened with Galwan Pangongso, work is progressing at a much faster pace after that.  India is also working fast.  In Arunachal Pradesh, there are many things like Sela Pass, railway lines, roads, widening etc. that are being done and I think that India should talk about the Upper Siang Project in Arunachal Pradesh.  All the people present here, all the stakeholders, they should be made to sit and be explained that this dam is very important because it is stuck right now and as you know China, Medong is building the biggest dam. So, China has its eyes on Arunachal Pradesh, but most of all, China has its eyes on the Siliguri Corridor in the North East.  Here, China needs Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal.  This is a tri-junction and if China settles there, then China will come under control to a large extent and India will never allow this to happen. So that is why China basically wants many of the projects in India and after that, China wants water. wants water.  Look, there is severe water crisis everywhere in China.  The situation in Northern China is very bad.  This is what Hemant Mishra Sharma had said here that China should stop the Brahmaputra.  More than half of the water comes from India only.  So he needs water somewhere.  And if you look everywhere, you will find water only, water only, in the entire war. So these are the interests of China and after that China wants to build these two corridors, CPEC and SIMAC, for its own interests so that the energy consumption can be reduced.  Then China is here and it controls any insurgency that occurs from here. Controls Uighur Muslims.  Ok ?  Controls ETEM. It controls the East Turkmenistan Movement.  So that is why China wants to bring Bangladesh and Pakistan together by hook or by crook and Afghanistan, now see, a similar summit was held in Afghanistan, the same was organised for CPK, China diverted CPK from Afghanistan, CPK will never be completed from Pakistan, so preparations are on to divert it from Afghanistan, friends, more than 10 years have passed for CPK, nothing has happened, nothing and now I am writing this to you, CPK, any corridor of China can never be completed, it will never happen, forget it, China is trapped by investing so much money of 65 billion dollars, now see, till now China did not have Bangladesh, but last August Bangladesh also joined hands with China, whatever CIA did, and all this was America's game, now Bangladesh is also with China. Now, brothers of China, the advisors of Bangladesh, friends, there is news from three days ago that they met the ISI, they are continuously facing a huge threat from ISI for the Hindu minorities here, right, this has been going on since last October, ISI is very active here, Harkat Ansar and all those who have left out Jashimuddin, right, all the Ansarullah Ansarullah, they are all working together with the ISI and are spreading instability in Bengal, North East, China is giving them money.  You look at China now, let me tell you how China is working.  Is it okay?  Now what did he say?  China is saying that we will work on cooperation.  Ok?  We will establish a working group so that we can come to an understanding and all three of us can work together.  And this is true multilateralism and regionalism.   The SEO defense summit is about to take place. Rajnath Singh will go there and see, you can do whatever you want.  Tell me, the one who has power is Alexander.  So Yunus Mohammad Yunus was also seen with Pakistan. But now they are saying that whatever we make is okay?  We will work in agriculture.  We will work in the trade.  We will work in the industry.  Basically, China will give the money.  Ok? China will give lots of money in the name of all these companies.  Whom? To Pakistan's ISI.  Whom? To Bangladesh.  And what will they do?  This will spread instability in India.  Ok? Isn't it dominance?  Whoever has the power will rule. All the rules went to hell.  Ok?  Today America has power.  That's Trump dictating.  If you want to surrender then do it. So what will China do now?  The money will come through these sources only.  And as we told you terrorists are active in Bangladesh. ISI is active.  They will spread instability through the North East. Murshidabad, Malda are some of the districts in Bengal where instability will spread.  It will spread rapidly. Radicalization will spread and RNW and our intelligence agencies have already marked this. Some riots in India like Sambhal violence took place. Right now in Murshidabad violence, ISI already has a link to it.  This is a completely well thought out strategy.  Will I get nothing? Both countries will be ruined.  It is already ruined. will be totally ruined.  But this is the truth.  Ultimate Truth.  So Yunus has said that before we revive our links with Pakistan which were related to the 1971 war, we will try to revive them. I think Bangladeshis should understand their history and after that, the three countries have agreed that good neighbourliness is what we are good neighbours and we will do equality, mutual trust, openness and inclusiveness.  Sheikh Hasina also went to China, but China had begged Sheikh Hasina, so Sheikh Hasina kicked China and came away. But now Bangladesh is completely sitting in the lap of China.  Bangladesh needs money at any cost because all the businesses in Bangladesh have closed down.  India has also tightened its grip.  So nobody is giving money to Bangladesh.  Whatever cotton was exported is in trouble.  So Bangladesh needs money at any cost because a huge crisis has arisen in Bangladesh.  And after that, their C-VAC economic corridor which was built from Myanmar will also not be built.  Because civil war is going on in Myanmar also. Now trade investment, agriculture, digital economy, environment, protection, marine sciences, green infrastructure, culture, education, people to people exchange. All these things have been said. What will you do in people to people exchange?  They will send those people in the name of humanitarian. Like the Insaaniyat Foundation, it belongs to Lashkar.  Lashkar Taiba is saying that they will do people to people exchange. Brother, this is all a big game.  Countries use their intelligence agencies to spread instability in other countries.  This is how the game goes.  RNA WB is active.   It is not that India is not doing anything at all. But this is dangerous for India. He needs money for Pakistan at any cost and he just wants to see the destruction of India. Whatever happens, destroy yourself.   It does n't make any sense to him.  But India should be destroyed in every way.  So there is another problem in the North East just like there is some problem in Manipur too, however yesterday very good news came that the Indian Government has now started the talks.  The movement of trade which is the movement of goods and the movement of people has now started. Ok?  A suspension of operations SO agreement is also going to be signed with cookies. So this is a good thing.  But still there is instability in some particular areas of the North East, especially in Manipur.  So these vulnerable points, these people can utilize them.  So let's see what happens next.  What do you think, please tell me in the comment box.  Be happy, keep reading.  This is Siddhant signing off.
