Hello Friends.  Friends, the way America attacked Iran's nuclear sites yesterday, you will see a panic-like situation not only in the Middle East but the entire world.  The wait is that after all this is the Israel-Iran war in which now even America has jumped in. In which direction will it move?  Meaning what can happen from here. Now you can see that Iran has taken a very big decision.  Let me tell you, this will have huge economic consequences.  In fact, America has called it economic suicide because the parliament of Iran has approved the State of Hormus because ever since this war started there has been a lot of discussion about the State of Hormus, which I will tell you in the video, the parliament of Iran has decided to close it, that means it has given the permission, you can see the news Iranian parliament approves closing of State of Hormus, USA asks China to intervene, so somewhere in the midst of this whole matter, now America also wants China to help here.  China should intervene so that this economic suicide being committed by Iran does not happen.  So we will understand this in a little detail.  I will tell you the complete analysis as to what can happen next. You will get to know a lot.  Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that from today, our UPSC batch of 2026, Pratigya Batch, is starting.

You will get all the things. All you have to do is use this code ANIKT LIVE so that you can avail maximum discount on the course.  Let's get started.  The first question that comes to mind is what is the Strait of Holmes?  See, this is a strategic junction point which you will find between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  Because now see, from your exam perspective, this has become very important which is the state of homo. If you look carefully here, you will see the largest coastline of the State of Homos, that of Iran.  This is Iran here.  Apart from this, the border of Iraq also lies here.   Along with the Persian Gulf, there is Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia is there. UAE is done and Oman is done.  Now look carefully.  Many people make mistakes in this state of homo. He says that it is here between UAE and Iran.  It's not like that.  If you look at it carefully, this small territory of Oman, this part of the territory belongs to Oman. So the state of hormones is actually between Oman and Iran.  And which two bodies does it connect?  Here is the Gulf of Oman and this is the Persian Gulf.  It connects both of them. And why is this strategic ?  Because a large part of the world's oil and gas passes through this particular route. Now if this route gets closed then you can understand how big a shortage can happen , there can be problems regarding oil and gas and you can see that it is said here that 20 to 30% of global oil passes through this particular route.  There is a very large quantity of natural gas available because Qatar is the world's largest producer of natural gas; you will find it here too. So their export also happens from here only.  So from this you will understand how important it becomes.  The major exporters like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar are all dependent on this particular route.  Because if this route gets closed then the exports here could suffer a big blow. And it is only 21 nautical miles wide.   That means, the narrowest point of the State of Formos is only 21 nautical miles. Meaning, you should understand that here Iran is saying that the Parliament of Iran has given approval that you can block this State of Hermouse whenever you want. So now the question here is why did Iran take this decision?  The first thing is that the air strike carried out by the US is a kind of crossing of a red line for Iran. Iran had clearly said that if the US takes any such step, it would be crossing the red line and we would make a huge retaliation.   In fact, here you can see that you must have been hearing B to Bombers since yesterday. They have tried to destroy the Fado facility here, especially the one that was very important for Iran, by penetrating it and bombing it.  Apart from this, it is also being said that efforts are being made to kill Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran. Now he has to hide in the bunker here. He is living in the bunker. But somewhere you will understand that again this is a big reason because of which Iran took the decision.  Secondly, what is here is that Iran might be trying to signal in a way that we can withdraw from NPT which is a Non Proliferation Treaty of which India is not a part yet, so Iran can resign from its membership here, so this will also become an important thing and somewhere or the other, an attempt will be made by Iran to weaponize its nuclear program.  Then secondly what is here is that their army, the IRGC and the hard liners in Iran are pushing that you should take aggressive stance. Meaning the way America has carried out this attack, Iran should not remain silent and somewhere this is a very aggressive move, which I will tell you more about later.  This talk of blockading the State of Hermus is going on. Trying to block.  And at the same time wants to show a view of Iran that it is our sovereign right to open and close this state. It is our sovan right under which we can do all these things. Well, the question now is that if this state of hormones ends then what will be its implications ?  The first is economic weaponization.   This means that $1 trillion dollars worth of oil and gas is traded here every year. So, it will be completely disrupted. There will be massive global inflation because the oil prices, you can understand, can rise to $50, $200 or even anywhere if it is stopped. Due to which it is obvious that when the oil prices increase so much then inflation is bound to happen and if inflation happens rapidly then it can impact your GDP.   So many things can happen.  Apart from this, here also international law is being violated.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea does not allow you to blockade this water body and Iran is also a signatory to this.  But he says that we are doing this in self-defense. Then thirdly here's the military flash point.   I mean, I will show you the Fifth Fleet of the US Navy. If you look at this map, in the Persian Gulf, here is Bahrain.  In Bahrain you will get to see the US Navy's Fifth Fleet.  And it is possible that somewhere here a big war can be seen.  Which are US warships and which are Iran's IRGC, these are different things.  For example IRGC, fast track craft, sea mines, drones, submarines, a big war can be seen between all these.  Apart from this, Iran here can target the Gulf Nations and your tankers which are related to US and Israel.  So Iran has a lot of options at the moment and that is why America does not want this to happen because America says that this would be economic suicide.  You can see this US Secretary of State Marco Robio, who is also a National Security Advisor. He actually said here that we want to encourage China to talk to Iran and not shut down State of Homo.  I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them.  Call them about that. Meaning, this is a crystal clear instruction from America to China that you should call Iran on an immediate basis and tell them not to block the State of Hormos.  If they do it will be another terrible mistake.  Meaning, Iran will make a big mistake and it will commit economic suicide.  Meaning America is calling it as economic suicide, due to which there can be a huge impact on Iran.  Look, Donald Trump had said that if Iran does not retaliate then the matter will be resolved here.  But it is obvious that the government will try to show what the country is to the domestic audience in Iran as well. Well now the question here is why did the US ask China to intervene?  There are two more countries in the world. So the basic thing is that China has leverage at this time.  What I mean by leverage is that even today, China buys most of the oil from Iran. You can see that currently China buys oil from Iran at the rate of 1 million barrels per day. And China has invested around 400 billion in Iran.  In the last 25 years, you will see more strategic pacts between the two countries. Then the second reason is that look, America does not want to jump completely into the war.  I mean, look at what Donald Trump has been saying, he has been saying repeatedly that we do not want war because if there is a war then American citizens will suffer.   The American soldiers will have to come. So this costs a lot of money. So Trump's policy has been that we do not want to fight a war.  But actually Trump himself declared this entire war. Well, apart from this, China's global economic interest means that Beijing needs Gulf oil at this time.  So, somewhere or the other, because of the many things that it has done in the Belt and Road Initiative, it can exploit its interest and put pressure on Iran to deescalate; China can privately tell it to deescalate.  Yes, he will try to show publicly that no, yes we are with Iran and we sympathize with it.  But anyway, here if we talk about China's dilemma, then basically there are many critical geopolitical tests for China at this time.  The first is that China imports about 40% of its oil from the Gulf.  So here he can put pressure on Iran to intervene, that is, Iran should not block here.  But the second thing is that China would also like to remain neutral.  So in a way that is a strategic tie with Iran.  You see anti-US sentiment in China.  So because of this there are both conditions.  Then there is Avoid Global Recession.  Meaning that if China puts pressure on Iran then China tells Iran not to block it. So it is obvious that this will be beneficial. Because once the blockage happens, inflation will increase.  There may be a big threat of global recession. But on the other hand, China would also like that the US hedgmoney should be opposed. So this is a bit of a dilemma here.  Well, the question here now is what can happen next?  Look at the two scenarios. The first best case scenario could be that China makes Iran work.  Tell Iran that look, you will have to do this deescalation from here. Yes, in a way an attempt will be made to show that yes, look, there has been a diplomatic pause here.  Oil prices may not increase that much.  So the ultimate effort is that oil prices should not increase.  Now it can be done in any way because China also knows that if the oil prices increase then China will also suffer a big loss and in a way, there can be a recession in China also.  But suppose if Iran does not succumb to China's pressure, China does not speak and remains neutral in a way, then military clashes can also be witnessed here. Basically, the US and its allies may take out the ships from the State of Hormos while guarding them so that Iran cannot attack it and the IRGC can use missiles, sea mines, drones and many other things on the ships. It is possible that Israeli strikes may also start here, then you can see many scenarios, but from our perspective, if we talk about what is important from India's perspective, look, definitely there will be a big impact for us, earlier, if you see, almost 50% of our oil used to come from the State of Hormos.  I used to come from there. But as of today, it has reduced considerably.  But we are still getting significant amount from there.  So, one of our problems is that the oil etc. that we are importing may get disrupted. Overall oil prices may increase. Which again is not good for developing countries like India.  Secondly, here India is trying to diversify its oil trade.  Ah, we are already buying a lot from Russia. Apart from this, we also order from US and other places. Even if you look at the US imports from the State of Holmo, it is 440,000 barrels per day, it has gone that far and there is also a buffer.  You know that here under the Strategic Reserve, India keeps a hold of crude oil for 9 to 10 days so that we do not face any problem in an emergency situation. But again you can see that Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has also assured the country that you need not worry, we are very conscious about oil.  He said that we have been closely monitoring the entire geopolitical situation and in the last few years we have diversified our oil trade and oil supply so that we do not remain dependent on a single country and the oil marketing companies are also keeping the supply for a few weeks with themselves.  So let's see what ultimately happens regarding this. But I hope that through this video, you have understood the discussion that was going on about the state of homos and before leaving, I have a very interesting question, can you tell me what was Operation Sun launched by India in 2019?
