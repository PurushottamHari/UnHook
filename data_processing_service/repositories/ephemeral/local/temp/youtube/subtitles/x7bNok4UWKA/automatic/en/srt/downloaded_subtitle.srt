00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello Friends.  Friends, the way

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,720
America attacked Iran's nuclear sites yesterday,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,880

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,200
you will see a panic-like situation not only in the Middle East but the entire world.  The

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,599
wait is that

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,560
after all this is the Israel-Iran war

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,960
in which now even America has jumped in.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,039
In which direction will it move?  Meaning what can happen from here.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,119
Now you can see that

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,960
Iran has taken a very big decision.  Let me

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,199
tell you, this will have huge economic

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,920
consequences.  In fact, America has

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
called it economic suicide because the

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
parliament of Iran has

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,480
approved the State of Hormus

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
because ever since this war started

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,160
there has been a lot of discussion about the State of Hormus,

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,800
which I will tell you in the video, the

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,559

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,320
parliament of Iran has decided to close it, that means it has given the permission,

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,640
you can see the news Iranian

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
parliament approves closing of State

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,640
of Hormus, USA asks China to intervene, so

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,039
somewhere in the midst of this whole matter, now

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,680
America also wants China to

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,000
help here.  China should intervene so that this

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,159
economic suicide being committed by Iran does

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,240
not happen.  So we will understand this in a little detail.  I will

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,720
tell you the

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,560
complete analysis as to what can happen next.

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,840
You will get to know a lot.  Let's

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,720
move on.  But before that, friends, let me

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,799
tell you all that from today, our

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,040
UPSC batch of 2026, Pratigya Batch, is starting.  The

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
most special thing about this is that by

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,119
taking this batch, your preparation for prelims, mains,

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,759
interview is done in the same batch.

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,520
And if you crack even the prelims,

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,320
your entire fees will be

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,960
refunded.  Another special thing is that

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,960
you will get a trial of Days.  This means that

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,600
if you do not understand or like the course in 7 days,

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,439
you can get your money back.

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,520
So this is the first time such things are being done

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,600
inside UPSC by Study IQ

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,759
and if you need any more information,

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,680
I have a personal team, you can call them on the number.

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,439
You will get all the things.

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
All you have to do is use this code

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,000
ANIKT LIVE so that you

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
can avail maximum discount on the course.  Let's get started.  The

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,479
first question that comes to mind is

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,479
what is the Strait of Holmes?  See, this is a

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,439
strategic junction point which you will

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,600

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,200
find between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  Because now see,

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,039
from your exam perspective, this has become very

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
important which is the state of homo.

59
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,680
If you look carefully here,

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,760

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,920
you will see the largest coastline of the State of Homos, that

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,840
of Iran.  This is Iran here.  Apart from this, the

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,720
border of Iraq also lies here.   Along

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,959
with the Persian Gulf, there is Kuwait,

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,360
Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia is there.

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
UAE is done and Oman is done.  Now

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
look carefully.  Many people make mistakes in this state of homo.

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,200
He says that it

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,120
is here between UAE and Iran.  It's

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,519
not like that.  If you look at it carefully, this

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,319
small territory of Oman, this

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,680
part of the territory belongs to Oman.

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,879
So the state of hormones is actually between

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,040
Oman and Iran.  And which two bodies does it

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,040
connect?  Here is the Gulf of Oman

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,040
and this is the Persian Gulf.  It connects both of them.

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,360
And why is this strategic

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,160
?  Because a large part of the world's oil and

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,400
gas passes through this particular route.

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,640
Now if this route gets closed then you

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
can understand how big a shortage can happen

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
, there can be problems regarding oil and gas

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,840
and you can see that it is said here

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,239
that 20 to 30% of global oil

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
passes through this particular route.  There is a very large

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
quantity of natural gas available because Qatar is the

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
world's largest producer of

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
natural gas; you will find it here too.

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,159
So their export also happens

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,480
from here only.  So from this you will understand

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,120
how important it becomes.  The

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,840
major exporters like Saudi Arabia, UAE,

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,400
Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar are all

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,159
dependent on this particular route.  Because if this

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
route gets closed then the

96
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,599
exports here could suffer a big blow.

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
And it is only 21 nautical miles wide.   That

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,799
means, the narrowest point of the State

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,840
of Formos is only 21 nautical miles.

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,519
Meaning, you should understand that here Iran is saying that the

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,159
Parliament of Iran has

102
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,720
given approval that you

103
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,879
can block this State of Hermouse whenever you want.

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,080
So now the question here is

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,319
why did Iran take this decision?  The first

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,200
thing is that the air strike carried out by the US is

107
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,360
a kind of crossing of a red line for Iran.

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,439
Iran had clearly

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,680
said that if the US takes any such

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
step, it would be crossing the red line

111
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,919
and we would make a huge retaliation.   In

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
fact, here you can see that

113
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,720
you must have been hearing B to Bombers since yesterday.

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,960
They have tried to destroy the Fado facility here,

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,160
especially the one that was very important

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,560
for Iran, by penetrating it and bombing it.  Apart from this,

117
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,560

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,680
it is also being said

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,160
that

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,919
efforts are being made to kill Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran.

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,840
Now he has to hide in the bunker here.

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,840
He is living in the bunker.

123
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000
But somewhere you will understand that again

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,919
this is a big reason because of which Iran

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,759
took the decision.  Secondly, what is here is that

126
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,720
Iran might be trying to signal in a way

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,880
that we can withdraw from NPT

128
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
which is a Non Proliferation Treaty of

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,720
which India is not a part yet, so Iran

130
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,960
can resign from its membership here,

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
so this will also become an important thing

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,039
and somewhere or the other, an

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,039
attempt will be made

134
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,680
by Iran to weaponize its nuclear program.  Then secondly

135
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,320
what is here is that their army, the IRGC and

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,880
the hard liners in Iran are pushing

137
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,680
that you should take aggressive stance.

138
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,320
Meaning the way America has carried out this attack,

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,639
Iran should not remain silent

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,240
and somewhere this is a very aggressive move,

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,320
which I will tell you more about later.  This

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,160

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,560
talk of blockading the State of Hermus is going on.

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,360
Trying to block.  And at the same time

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,400
wants to show a view of Iran that it is

146
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,280
our sovereign right to open and close this state.

147
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,680
It is our sovan right

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,400
under which we can do all these things.

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,720
Well, the question now is that if this

150
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,280
state of hormones ends then what will be its implications

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,680
?  The first is economic weaponization.   This

152
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,560
means that $1 trillion dollars

153
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
worth of oil and gas is traded here every year.

154
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,039
So, it will be completely disrupted.

155
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,520
There will be massive global inflation

156
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,960
because the oil prices, you can

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,039
understand, can rise to $50, $200 or even anywhere

158
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,039
if it is stopped.

159
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,600
Due to which it is obvious that when the oil

160
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,600
prices increase so much then inflation is bound to happen

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,759
and if inflation happens rapidly then it

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
can impact your GDP.   So

163
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,080
many things can happen.  Apart from this,

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,160
here also international law is being

165
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,280
violated.  The UN

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,520
Convention on the Law of the Sea does

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,479
not allow you to blockade this water body

168
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,199
and Iran is also a

169
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,199
signatory to this.  But he says that

170
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,199
we are doing this in self-defense.

171
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,319
Then thirdly here's the military flash point.   I

172
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,919
mean, I will show you the Fifth Fleet of the US Navy.

173
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,919
If you look at this map,

174
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,479
in the Persian Gulf, here is

175
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,520
Bahrain.  In Bahrain you will get to see the

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,600
US Navy's Fifth Fleet.  And it is

177
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,000
possible that somewhere here a

178
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,800
big war can be seen.  Which are US

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,560
warships and which are Iran's IRGC, these are

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,120
different things.  For example

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,440
IRGC, fast track craft, sea mines,

182
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,680
drones, submarines, a big war can be seen between all these.  Apart from this,

183
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,520

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,520
Iran here can target the Gulf Nations and your

185
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,080
tankers which are related to US and

186
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,160
Israel.  So

187
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,400
Iran has a lot of options at the moment

188
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
and that is why America does not want this to happen

189
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
because America says that this would be

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,800
economic suicide.  You can see this

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,199
US Secretary of State Marco Robio, who is

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
also a National Security Advisor.

193
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,759
He actually said here that

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,479
we want to encourage China to

195
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,800
talk to Iran and

196
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,880
not shut down State of Homo.  I encourage the Chinese government

197
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,960
in Beijing to call them.  Call them about that.

198
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,280
Meaning, this is a crystal clear instruction

199
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
from America to China that you should

200
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,879
call Iran on an immediate basis and tell them

201
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,599
not to block the State of Hormos.  If

202
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,240
they do it will be another terrible

203
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,199
mistake.  Meaning, Iran will make a big mistake

204
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,199
and it will commit economic suicide.  Meaning

205
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
America is calling it as economic suicide,

206
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,520
due to which there can be a

207
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,199
huge impact on Iran.  Look, Donald Trump had

208
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,039
said that if Iran does not retaliate

209
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
then the matter will be resolved here.  But it is

210
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,199
obvious that the government will try to show what the country is to the domestic audience in Iran as well.

211
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,440

212
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,840
Well now the question here is

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,000
why did the US ask China to

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,599
intervene?  There are two more countries in the world.

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,919
So the basic thing is that China has

216
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
leverage at this time.  What I

217
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,839
mean by leverage is that even today, China buys most of the oil from Iran.

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,279
You can see that

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,519
currently China buys oil from Iran at the rate of 1 million barrels per day.

220
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,360
And China has invested

221
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,440
around 400 billion in Iran.  In the last 25

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,519
years, you will see more strategic pacts

223
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,680
between the two countries.

224
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,160
Then the second reason is that look, America does

225
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,320
not want to jump completely into the war.  I

226
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,160
mean, look at what Donald

227
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,800
Trump has been saying, he has been saying repeatedly

228
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,040
that we do not want war because if there is a war

229
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,040
then American citizens will suffer.   The

230
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,200
American soldiers will have to come.

231
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,680
So this costs a lot of money.

232
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
So Trump's policy has been that we do

233
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
not want to fight a war.  But actually Trump

234
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,760
himself declared this entire war.

235
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,240
Well, apart from this, China's global

236
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
economic interest means that Beijing

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,320
needs Gulf oil at this time.  So, somewhere or the

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
other, because of the many things that it has done in the Belt and Road Initiative, it

239
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399

240
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,279
can exploit its interest and put

241
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,720
pressure on Iran to deescalate;

242
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,800
China can privately tell it to

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,080
deescalate.  Yes, he will try to show publicly

244
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,320
that no, yes we are

245
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
with Iran and we sympathize with it.  But anyway, here

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,839
if we talk about China's dilemma, then

247
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,839
basically there are many critical geopolitical tests

248
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,760
for China at this time.  The first is that

249
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,560
China imports about 40% of its oil

250
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,440
from the Gulf.  So here he can put pressure

251
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,399
on Iran to intervene, that is, Iran should

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,800
not block here.  But the second thing is that

253
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,959
China would also like to remain neutral.  So in a

254
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,680
way that is a strategic tie

255
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,080
with Iran.  You see anti-US

256
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,560
sentiment in China.  So because of this there

257
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,760
are both conditions.  Then there is Avoid

258
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,160
Global Recession.  Meaning that if

259
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,560
China puts pressure on Iran then China tells

260
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,399
Iran not to block it.

261
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,839
So it is obvious that this will be beneficial.

262
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
Because once the blockage happens,

263
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,320
inflation will increase.  There may be a big threat of global recession.

264
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,720
But on the other hand, China would

265
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,839
also like that the US hedgmoney should be opposed.

266
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,000
So this is a bit of a dilemma

267
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,160
here.  Well, the question here now is

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
what can happen next?  Look at the two scenarios. The

269
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,040
first best case scenario could be that China makes

270
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,920
Iran work.  Tell Iran

271
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,160
that look, you will have to do this deescalation from here.

272
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,640
Yes, in a way an

273
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,880
attempt will be made to show that yes, look, there has been a

274
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
diplomatic pause here.  Oil

275
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,440
prices may not increase that much.  So the

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
ultimate effort is that oil prices

277
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
should not increase.  Now it can be done in any way

278
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
because China also knows that

279
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,320
if the oil prices increase then China will

280
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,880
also suffer a big loss and in a way, there

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,360
can be a recession in China also.  But

282
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
suppose if Iran does not succumb to China's pressure,

283
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
China does not speak and

284
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,200
remains neutral in a way, then

285
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,000
military clashes can also be witnessed here.

286
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,240
Basically, the US and its allies

287
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,560
may take

288
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,880
out the ships from the State of Hormos while guarding them

289
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,519
so that Iran cannot attack it and the

290
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,160
IRGC can use missiles, sea mines, drones and many other

291
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,040
things on the ships. It is

292
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,800
possible that Israeli strikes may also

293
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,040
start here, then

294
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,959
you can see many scenarios, but

295
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,640
from our perspective, if we talk about

296
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,800
what is important from India's perspective,

297
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,560
look, definitely there will be a big impact for us,

298
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,519
earlier, if you see,

299
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,440
almost 50% of our oil used to come from the State of Hormos.  I used to

300
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,440
come from there.

301
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,600
But as of today,

302
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
it has reduced considerably.  But

303
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,920
we are still getting significant amount from there.  So, one of

304
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,600
our problems is that the

305
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,079
oil etc. that we are importing may get disrupted.

306
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,160
Overall oil prices may increase.

307
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,160
Which again is

308
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,480
not good for developing countries like India.  Secondly, here

309
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,639
India is trying to

310
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
diversify its oil trade.  Ah,

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,720
we are already buying a lot from Russia.

312
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,040
Apart from this,

313
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,279
we also order from US and other places.

314
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,800
Even if you look at the US imports from the State of Holmo, it is

315
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,040
440,000 barrels per day, it has gone that far

316
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,600
and there is also a buffer.  You know that here

317
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,000
under the Strategic Reserve, India

318
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,079
keeps a hold of crude oil for 9 to 10 days so that

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
we do not face any problem in an emergency situation.

320
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
But again you can see

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh

322
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,480
Puri has also assured the country that

323
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,959
you need not worry, we are very

324
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
conscious about oil.  He said that we have been

325
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,360
closely monitoring the entire

326
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,519
geopolitical situation and

327
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,519
in the last few years we have diversified our oil trade and

328
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,760
oil supply

329
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,320
so that we do not remain dependent on a single country

330
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,320
and the oil marketing companies are

331
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,399
also keeping the supply for a few weeks with

332
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
themselves.  So let's see

333
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,839
what ultimately happens regarding this.

334
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,839
But I hope that through this video,

335
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680

336
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
you have understood the discussion that was going on about the state of homos and

337
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,320
before leaving, I have a very interesting question, can
