00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,319
Hello Friends.  Friends, recently the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,160
Global Gender Gap Index was released

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,480
and it caught the attention of many people.  Let

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,800
me tell you that India's

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,120
rank has actually declined.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,360
Meaning, here instead of improving, we are

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,600
going backwards and all our neighbouring

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,840
countries are somehow ahead of us.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,359
Except Pakistan.  Well here you

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,920
can see India slips to 131 position.  And

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,760
I am not saying this out of 191 countries.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,800
This 131 position basically out of 146 countries

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,800
means we are at the bottom.  So, there is a

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,280
need to understand this in a little bit of detail as to

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,440
what exactly happened and how did India fall behind

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
?  What is its implication and what should we do next.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,960
You will get to know a lot.

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,719
Let's move on.  But

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,879
before that, friends, let me tell you all that if you have

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,680

found in the comment section.  Let's get started.

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,360
Look, from your exam perspective there are some

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,840
important things which you should know like the

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,880
Global Gender Gap Index is

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,280
released annually every year by the

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,240
World Economic Forum and it is being released

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,560
since 2006 and basically its main

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,360
purpose is to measure the gender based

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,479
disparities within the countries

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,799
and basically you will find four main dimensions in it

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,720
and all have

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,720
equal weightage 25, 25 and 25% so the first one here is

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
Economic

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,759
Participation and Opportunity.  Meaning, what is the

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,079
labour force participation like in which country

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,159
?  Are only men working

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,240
?  How much are women working?

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,960
How is wage equality?  Do

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,960
men and women get the same equal wages here

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
?  Or are women far behind?

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,600

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,840
How important is the role of women in professional and technical roles?

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,640
Apart from this, what is the education attainment i.e.

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,799
literacy rate and enrolment in primary,

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
secondary and tertiary education

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
?  Again here women are lagging behind,

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,040
girls are lagging behind.  Apart from this, there is

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,360
also discussion about health and survival.

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,480
Meaning the sex ratio at birth and life

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,800
expectancy.  Which country

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,760
stands at what position in this?  And last comes

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,080
political empowerment.  Meaning,

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,080
what is the participation of women in politics?

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
How many women are there in the Parliament?

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,319
How many women are there in ministerial positions here

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,520
?  So all these things are seen here.

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,920
So on the basis of these four things you

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,160
get some points and accordingly the

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,879
countries here are told

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,599
what their ranking is?  So if I

67
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,400
tell you that if your point is zero.

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,959
If you are on the side of zero then there is complete inequality.   There

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,280
is no equality in your country.  But

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,160
if your point one comes exactly then it

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,000
means you have 100% equality.  So it

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,680
is obvious that you will not get to see forests in any country.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239
But here,

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,480
if you see India's performance, it has

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,519
actually gone downward.

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,319
You can see it in the global ranking in 146 countries.  India

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,560
's rank last year was actually

78
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,200
129 and this year it has fallen to 131 and

79
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,760
we have fallen behind among 146 countries.

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,840
But if we talk about the overall score,

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,159
here the overall score has

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,560
improved a little bit.  Our score last year was

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:25,040
63.8 and now it has increased to 64.1, which means

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,599
that even though our

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,920
score has improved and become better, the

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,080
other countries have

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,319
performed better than us.  Because of which he has

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,280
moved ahead.  And in fact, if you

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,920
look at the top 10 countries, here Iceland is the

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,640
first country, that is, the top country, where you will find the

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,440
least inequality and its

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,319
score is 0.92, meaning you see the difference,

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,159
our score is 64.1,

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,599
this is in percentage, so you can call it

95
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,239
0.64 like this, and here their score is

96
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,480
0.92 and there is Finland, then

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,640
Norway, then UK, then New Zealand

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,400
and you can see the rest of the countries here,

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
but what is the important thing.  The

100
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,920
important thing is that

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,040
if you look at the global average score, it is 68.8%,

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,400
whereas India's score is even less than the global average.

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,759
We have achieved 64.1%

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,320
only.  And if we continue at this pace, it will

105
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,120

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,280
take us 123 years to achieve global parity here.  So you can understand

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,680
how many concerns there are for India that

108
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,919
we are far behind in the global gender gap.

109
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
A lot of work remains to be done regarding this.  Now the

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,000
question here is what are we lagging behind in?

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,639
I told you four things here –

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,479
economic participation, education

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,639
, health, political empowerment.  It is

114
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,800

115
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,880

116
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
very important to know in which of these India is performing better and in which it is lagging behind because

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
without this we will not be able to know the exact information

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,320
because if we look at the Global Gender

119
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,720
Gap Index, we are very low.

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,639
But exactly why it is below is

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
important for you.  The first and most

122
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,479
important thing is economic

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,600
participation and opportunity.  Here

124
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,080
again the score is very low, ours is only 40.6%.

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,960
And if you look globally,

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,720
its rank is 144 out of 146 countries.  Meaning, we are

127
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,280
in the bottom five

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,840
in economic participation.  This means that the

129
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,320
important issue is that the

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240
labour force participation of women is very low.

131
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,479

132
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,880
It remains at 45.9%.  Women are

133
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,880
not working much.  I mean, look

134
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,800
what happens in our country is that the role of a housewife is very

135
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,960
important.  So the thing is that it is

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,039
not measured in monetary terms.  So

137
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,919
this becomes a big reason due to which

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,400
women's labour force participation is low.  Then

139
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,800
apart from this wage parity means that if

140
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,840
you see, in our country women

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,160

142
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,240
earn only 30% of the income of men.  Apart from this, there is low

143
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,919
female representation in senior and

144
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,160
technical roles.  It also becomes important

145
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,320
that the higher the roles, the

146
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,080
lesser will be the participation of women.

147
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,560
So what is its cause?  Firstly, there

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,960
is an informal economy in our country.

149
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,880
You will see issues related to gender norms.  Safety issues will be

150
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,120
seen.  I told you about the unpaid care work that

151
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,039

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
women do at home in our country but it is

153
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,840
not visible.  In fact, they might be working more than men

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,440
but somewhere those

155
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,280
things do not come in monetary terms

156
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,160
due to which these issues are seen.

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,240
Well, if we talk about education entertainment,

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,960
India is in fact performing well here.

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,520
We are among the top 30 countries.

160
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,520
If you see our score here, it is 97%.  The

161
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,240
reason for this is that the literacy rate in our country has

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
improved a lot.  And the

163
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,720
gender gap in primary and tertiary

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
enrolment has actually reduced.  And

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,639
what are the challenges?  There are challenges too.  The

166
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,880
drop rates here in secondary schools are

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,160
high.  Rural urban disparity will

168
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,400
still be seen.  But

169
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,479
if you look still comparatively,

170
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,479
India is performing well in education.  As far as

171
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,280
health and survival are concerned, we are

172
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,400
performing moderately in this too.  The score is 95%

173
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,479
and you will also see the global ranking in the top 6070.

174
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
And as far as progress

175
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,160
is concerned, the sex ratio at birth is

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,319
improving here.  But it's still a bit

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
skewed.  So there is a need to focus on this.

178
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,919
Female life expectancy is

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,080
gradually rising, which is a good thing.

180
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,840
But what are the challenges?  Challenges are

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,639
gender based sex selection.  Even now,

182
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,400
if you see in many rural areas,

183
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,319
boys are preferred more.

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,240
So this is a big problem.  Maternal

185
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,560
health is also a big problem in rural areas.

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720
So because of all this we

187
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,199
can improve a little bit here also.  But the

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
biggest blow

189
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,680
for India in this entire index is political

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,919
empowerment.  In this our points are

191
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,680
actually in minus.  Yes, -0.6 and

192
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,280
globally we are down.  In fact, if you

193
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,840
see the decline in this, the

194
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
problem here is the participation of women and

195
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,080

196
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,680
how many women are there in the Parliament.  In the previous Lok Sabha it

197
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,240
was 14.7% which has fallen further.

198
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,080
13.8% The Lok Sabha results that came out

199
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,160
last year show that the participation of women

200
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,080
in the Parliament has decreased further.

201
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Then how many ministers are

202
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,759
women?  You will see a decline in that too

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,639
from 6.5% to 5.6%. What is positive is that

204
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,639
if you look in India, the Head of the

205
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,960
Government has been Indira Gandhi ji

206
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,879
and apart from that Murmu ji has also been the President.

207
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,440
you all know.  So here

208
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
in the past there have been women at the level of Head of the Government.

209
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,440
But still the

210
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,919
overall representation here is

211
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,560
very low in politics.  So here if we talk about the

212
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,319
performance of India and all the countries around us,

213
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,479
for example Bangladesh.

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,319
Bangladesh is performing very well.   It is

215
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,319
24 but the way the situation is

216
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,240
in Bangladesh, the day is not far when

217
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,240
it will start slipping very fast here.

218
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,719
Well apart from this, if we talk about Bhutan, it

219
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,519
is 100 119.  Nepal is at 125, Sri Lanka is at 130 and

220
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,839
India is at 131.  Meaning we are

221
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,320
behind all of them and Pakistan, whatever it is, is

222
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
last here.  It is not right to even compare them.

223
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
But here we need to

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,160
at least go ahead.  We are

225
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
so much behind our neighbours that we

226
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,040
need to get ahead of them.  Well, why did India's

227
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,519
rank go down here?  It's a simple thing.   If

228
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,519
you look at Women's Economic Participation in India, the

229
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,839
rise of female labour is

230
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,120
very low.  You get to see it on Unkwal in our country.

231
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,040
Then the ah formal

232
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,880
sector representation is again less.

233
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,720
Because of this women are not

234
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,640
able to participate.  Along with this, there is a

235
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
huge drop in political empowerment as I

236
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,040
told you inside the Parliament.

237
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,440
Apart from this, the relative stagnation here,

238
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,040
meaning India's score has improved a bit

239
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
but other countries have

240
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,800
performed better, so this is also a reason due to which the

241
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
rank went down and apart from this, the

242
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
progressive schemes here are

243
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,959
not implemented at the ground level,

244
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,040
even though the government brings many schemes like

245
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,040
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but such

246
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,640
schemes may

247
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,720
not work well at the ground level, for example,

248
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,680
if we talk about Haryana, then the

249
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,320
actual birth rate, that is, sex ratio

250
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,640
at birth, has actually

251
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,399
decreased which is very worrying.   There was

252
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
a lot of discussion about this last

253
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,560
year.  Well, what will be its implication on India

254
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,560
?  If we talk about social implications then

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,040
it obviously shows that there is

256
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,959
still gender bias in India.  There

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,279
are paternal norms and somewhere because of this, there is a

258
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,279

259
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,360
big blow to the dignity, autonomy and safety of women.  Even now, if

260
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
you observe, many women are

261
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,839

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
scared to go out, even in big cities.  So again, because of this, this

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,160
is a big issue of safety.

264
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,519
What is the economic implication?  India suffers a

265
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,000
loss of $770 billion every year here.

266
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,560
Because of gender gap issues.  Here the GDP

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,480
growth is low and actually the GDP growth which should have happened, does

268
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,480
not happen.  Innovation

269
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,240
productivity, that also seems to be a big setback for us.

270
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,920
As I

271
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,320
told you, there is under representation in politics.  Decision

272
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,880
making cannot be inclusive.  Due to the gender gap,

273
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,800
public trust in governance is

274
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,800
also low here.

275
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,279
So the question is what should be done?

276
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,120
What can happen; what can be done?  First of all, women

277
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,360
labour force participation should be increased here.

278
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,360
Skill development, maternity benefits,

279
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,920
work from home should be provided to them so that they

280
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,000
can work more in the corporate and

281
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,839
formal sector.  Apart from this, here in

282
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,680
politics, as you know now,

283
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240

284
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,240
33% reservation bill has been passed in the parliament.  It has not been implemented yet.  Apart from

285
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
this, gender quotas can also be encouraged at the party level.  Apart from

286
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,640

287
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
this, the safety and

288
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,800
legal framework here should be important for women.  The

289
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,200
anti-harassment laws should be

290
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,519
strengthened.  Women police force and

291
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,360
fast track should be improved.   The

292
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,079
cultural barriers that exist here, such as,

293
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,720
for example, gender sensitivity, should be

294
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,720
included in the school curriculum.  Many

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
campaigns like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao

296
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,760
should get more support.  Here,

297
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,519
we should focus on gender based budgeting,

298
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
how much budget is being allocated for women

299
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,600
and actually we should see what is the

300
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,760

301
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,079
impact of the gender policies on the ground level.

302
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
So this was the complete video, friends,

303
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,079
this was a big news for India.  So

304
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
I wanted to tell you about this and

305
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,680
before leaving I have an interesting question, can

306
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,240
you tell me which of these

307
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
dimensions does not come in the Global Gender Gap Index,

308
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
you have to tell this and the

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,200
right answer to this, as you all know, will be available on my Instagram,

310
