Hello Friends.  Friends, recently the Global Gender Gap Index was released and it caught the attention of many people.  Let me tell you that India's rank has actually declined. Meaning, here instead of improving, we are going backwards and all our neighbouring countries are somehow ahead of us. Except Pakistan.  Well here you can see India slips to 131 position.  And I am not saying this out of 191 countries. This 131 position basically out of 146 countries means we are at the bottom.  So, there is a need to understand this in a little bit of detail as to what exactly happened and how did India fall behind ?  What is its implication and what should we do next. You will get to know a lot. Let's move on.  But before that, friends, let me tell you all that if you have any doubt or any problem in the Pratigya Foundation Batch of Study IQ, UPSC 2026-27, we have prepared this team. Call this phone number here. All your doubts will be solved.  And you can use this code Ankit live so that you can get maximum discount and its link will be found in the comment section.  Let's get started. Look, from your exam perspective there are some important things which you should know like the Global Gender Gap Index is released annually every year by the World Economic Forum and it is being released since 2006 and basically its main purpose is to measure the gender based disparities within the countries and basically you will find four main dimensions in it and all have equal weightage 25, 25 and 25% so the first one here is Economic Participation and Opportunity.  Meaning, what is the labour force participation like in which country ?  Are only men working ?  How much are women working? How is wage equality?  Do men and women get the same equal wages here ?  Or are women far behind? How important is the role of women in professional and technical roles? Apart from this, what is the education attainment i.e. literacy rate and enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education ?  Again here women are lagging behind, girls are lagging behind.  Apart from this, there is also discussion about health and survival. Meaning the sex ratio at birth and life expectancy.  Which country stands at what position in this?  And last comes political empowerment.  Meaning, what is the participation of women in politics? How many women are there in the Parliament? How many women are there in ministerial positions here ?  So all these things are seen here. So on the basis of these four things you get some points and accordingly the countries here are told what their ranking is?  So if I tell you that if your point is zero. If you are on the side of zero then there is complete inequality.   There is no equality in your country.  But if your point one comes exactly then it means you have 100% equality.  So it is obvious that you will not get to see forests in any country. But here, if you see India's performance, it has actually gone downward. You can see it in the global ranking in 146 countries.  India 's rank last year was actually 129 and this year it has fallen to 131 and we have fallen behind among 146 countries. But if we talk about the overall score, here the overall score has improved a little bit.  Our score last year was 63.8 and now it has increased to 64.1, which means that even though our score has improved and become better, the other countries have performed better than us.  Because of which he has moved ahead.  And in fact, if you look at the top 10 countries, here Iceland is the first country, that is, the top country, where you will find the least inequality and its score is 0.92, meaning you see the difference, our score is 64.1, this is in percentage, so you can call it 0.64 like this, and here their score is 0.92 and there is Finland, then Norway, then UK, then New Zealand and you can see the rest of the countries here, but what is the important thing.  The important thing is that if you look at the global average score, it is 68.8%, whereas India's score is even less than the global average. We have achieved 64.1% only.  And if we continue at this pace, it will take us 123 years to achieve global parity here.  So you can understand how many concerns there are for India that we are far behind in the global gender gap. A lot of work remains to be done regarding this.  Now the question here is what are we lagging behind in? I told you four things here – economic participation, education , health, political empowerment.  It is very important to know in which of these India is performing better and in which it is lagging behind because without this we will not be able to know the exact information because if we look at the Global Gender Gap Index, we are very low. But exactly why it is below is important for you.  The first and most important thing is economic participation and opportunity.  Here again the score is very low, ours is only 40.6%. And if you look globally, its rank is 144 out of 146 countries.  Meaning, we are in the bottom five in economic participation.  This means that the important issue is that the labour force participation of women is very low. It remains at 45.9%.  Women are not working much.  I mean, look what happens in our country is that the role of a housewife is very important.  So the thing is that it is not measured in monetary terms.  So this becomes a big reason due to which women's labour force participation is low.  Then apart from this wage parity means that if you see, in our country women earn only 30% of the income of men.  Apart from this, there is low female representation in senior and technical roles.  It also becomes important that the higher the roles, the lesser will be the participation of women. So what is its cause?  Firstly, there is an informal economy in our country. You will see issues related to gender norms.  Safety issues will be seen.  I told you about the unpaid care work that women do at home in our country but it is not visible.  In fact, they might be working more than men but somewhere those things do not come in monetary terms due to which these issues are seen. Well, if we talk about education entertainment, India is in fact performing well here. We are among the top 30 countries. If you see our score here, it is 97%.  The reason for this is that the literacy rate in our country has improved a lot.  And the gender gap in primary and tertiary enrolment has actually reduced.  And what are the challenges?  There are challenges too.  The drop rates here in secondary schools are high.  Rural urban disparity will still be seen.  But if you look still comparatively, India is performing well in education.  As far as health and survival are concerned, we are performing moderately in this too.  The score is 95% and you will also see the global ranking in the top 6070. And as far as progress is concerned, the sex ratio at birth is improving here.  But it's still a bit skewed.  So there is a need to focus on this. Female life expectancy is gradually rising, which is a good thing. But what are the challenges?  Challenges are gender based sex selection.  Even now, if you see in many rural areas, boys are preferred more. So this is a big problem.  Maternal health is also a big problem in rural areas. So because of all this we can improve a little bit here also.  But the biggest blow for India in this entire index is political empowerment.  In this our points are actually in minus.  Yes, -0.6 and globally we are down.  In fact, if you see the decline in this, the problem here is the participation of women and how many women are there in the Parliament.  In the previous Lok Sabha it was 14.7% which has fallen further. 13.8% The Lok Sabha results that came out last year show that the participation of women in the Parliament has decreased further. Then how many ministers are women?  You will see a decline in that too from 6.5% to 5.6%. What is positive is that if you look in India, the Head of the Government has been Indira Gandhi ji and apart from that Murmu ji has also been the President. you all know.  So here in the past there have been women at the level of Head of the Government. But still the overall representation here is very low in politics.  So here if we talk about the performance of India and all the countries around us, for example Bangladesh. Bangladesh is performing very well.   It is 24 but the way the situation is in Bangladesh, the day is not far when it will start slipping very fast here. Well apart from this, if we talk about Bhutan, it is 100 119.  Nepal is at 125, Sri Lanka is at 130 and India is at 131.  Meaning we are behind all of them and Pakistan, whatever it is, is last here.  It is not right to even compare them. But here we need to at least go ahead.  We are so much behind our neighbours that we need to get ahead of them.  Well, why did India's rank go down here?  It's a simple thing.   If you look at Women's Economic Participation in India, the rise of female labour is very low.  You get to see it on Unkwal in our country. Then the ah formal sector representation is again less. Because of this women are not able to participate.  Along with this, there is a huge drop in political empowerment as I told you inside the Parliament. Apart from this, the relative stagnation here, meaning India's score has improved a bit but other countries have performed better, so this is also a reason due to which the rank went down and apart from this, the progressive schemes here are not implemented at the ground level, even though the government brings many schemes like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but such schemes may not work well at the ground level, for example, if we talk about Haryana, then the actual birth rate, that is, sex ratio at birth, has actually decreased which is very worrying.   There was a lot of discussion about this last year.  Well, what will be its implication on India ?  If we talk about social implications then it obviously shows that there is still gender bias in India.  There are paternal norms and somewhere because of this, there is a big blow to the dignity, autonomy and safety of women.  Even now, if you observe, many women are scared to go out, even in big cities.  So again, because of this, this is a big issue of safety. What is the economic implication?  India suffers a loss of $770 billion every year here. Because of gender gap issues.  Here the GDP growth is low and actually the GDP growth which should have happened, does not happen.  Innovation productivity, that also seems to be a big setback for us. As I told you, there is under representation in politics.  Decision making cannot be inclusive.  Due to the gender gap, public trust in governance is also low here. So the question is what should be done? What can happen; what can be done?  First of all, women labour force participation should be increased here. Skill development, maternity benefits, work from home should be provided to them so that they can work more in the corporate and formal sector.  Apart from this, here in politics, as you know now, 33% reservation bill has been passed in the parliament.  It has not been implemented yet.  Apart from this, gender quotas can also be encouraged at the party level.  Apart from this, the safety and legal framework here should be important for women.  The anti-harassment laws should be strengthened.  Women police force and fast track should be improved.   The cultural barriers that exist here, such as, for example, gender sensitivity, should be included in the school curriculum.  Many campaigns like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao should get more support.  Here, we should focus on gender based budgeting, how much budget is being allocated for women and actually we should see what is the impact of the gender policies on the ground level. So this was the complete video, friends, this was a big news for India.
