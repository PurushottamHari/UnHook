As soon as Kohinoor reached the soil of England , the Queen was hit on the head with an iron rod. Kuldeep Nair reached Rajya Sabha, got 50 MPs and Manmohan Singh ji to sign for Kohinoor.   The Taliban also jumped in saying that the Kohinoor is ours.  When the Queen received Kohinoor in front of the whole world, she got a black eye and an injury on her head. What is there in Kohinoor that India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan all are saying that they want it. Bad times started for the person to whom Kohinoor went other than the female. Kohinoor was of 795 carats but in the end only 105 carats were left.  Due to all these legal problems, Kohinoor has not been able to return to India till date.  In Article 3 of the Treaty of Lahore, it is clearly written that as soon as Kohinoor fell down from the turban, Nadir Shah said no to it.

Look, today there is Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh, so around the year 1306, this entire area was a part of the Golconda region and the Krishna river used to pass from this side.  The Kakatiya Dynasty ruled over this entire area and this Golconda region was the only region in the world at that time where diamonds were mined. Diamond mining had not taken place anywhere else before this. What the locals here used to do was extract diamonds on a daily basis using ancient placer mining, which was a technique. Basically, in this technique, these people used to mine diamonds from the alveolar deposits near rivers using bamboo sieve and the diamonds were also traded from here all over the world and this process continued for a long time. Now what happens in a day, what does a group do in the same year i.e. year 1306 ?  I was mining in this area and while mining I found a very unique diamond.  At that time its weight was 793 carats.  That means 158.6 grams.  He had exceptional clarity.  The clarity was at the level of what today we call a D grade diamond. Now when they found this diamond, all these people together went and gave this diamond to the rulers of the Kakatiya Dynasty. And then in this way, for the first time in the year 1306, this diamond came to the rulers of the Kakatiya Dynasty, which later came to be known as Kohinoor.  Look, in the details that I am giving you, you will find more things if you go on the internet.  But the rulers of the Kakatiya Dynasty are considered the first documented owners of the Kohinoor Diamond. And for the sake of understanding, I will now call this diamond Kohinoor Diamond.  But its name becomes Kohinoor later on. I will tell him now.  And let me add one more thing in this before telling you further that whatever details I am telling you about Koinoor Diamond, there are different stories and different details about it.  But I have picked only those details for which maximum records and facts are available.  For example, I chose the story of Golconda because it has the closest geological evidence and the writers' records are related to it.  For example, according to the evidence, Kohinoor is a Type 2A diamond in which there is no nitrogen impurity. And it is mined using an ancient placer mining technique.  And according to the experts, all the characteristics of this Koinoor diamond are exactly like the diamonds found in the Golconda region.  And many seismologists like Harsh K Gupta have also officially confirmed that Kohinoor is from the Golconda region. Even in 2023, research was published in the Journal of Earth System Science. In which it was told that Kohinoor Diamond originated from Kimber Light Pipe and the colourful wines of Golconda region were very famous for Kimber Light Field. I am telling you this story on the basis of satellite images, geochemical analysis and the closest proofs that have been matched so far. So what happens after this is that the diamond reaches the rulers of the Katakia Dynasty. And one thing common among their rulers was that they respected their family deity Bhadrakali ji a lot.  They also had a huge Bhadrakali temple in their capital Warangal. So when this diamond came to Kakti rulers, they decided that they will get it installed in the left eye of Goddess Bhadrakali inside the temple. And when this happened, after some time, this superstition also spread in the surrounding area that this was done because whoever will own this diamond will rule very strongly but his bad luck will start. [MUSIC] Only God and woman can wear this diamond without any harm.  That's why this was done.  Now look, the line I just said that the diamond will bring misfortune, people in the surrounding areas were talking about it. Whenever there is talk of Kohinoor, this line about misfortune and curse will always come in front of you.  And let me tell you one thing about this that if you go out to find its proof then only one thing will come up that this has been said in the Lost Hindu Text of the year 1306. But its direct citation is not mentioned in any Veda, Purana or any classical Hindu scriptures. But the reference given by people is the details given about Shyam Mantaka Mani in chapter 56 of Dasam Skandh of Bhagavat Purana. People compare it with the story of Kohinoor's misfortune and this thing is also backed by Indian historians and research scholars.  So, what I mean to say is that actually this story of curse and misfortune of Kohinoor Diamond is that whoever gets it, bad times will start for him. Only females can wear it.  This has emerged as a secondary and tertiary source. Meaning that its original source was not found but British, Indian and French writers and historians spoke so much about it that people started writing about it again and again which started being considered as proof.  So now see, when Kohinoor diamond came to Kakatiya Empire, at that time Kakatiya Empire was at its peak.  Wealth, power, diamonds, sports, strong administration, there was no one to defeat them anywhere.  But some time after the arrival of Kohinoor, Alauddin Khilji of Delhi Sultanate sent his general Malik Kafur to attack the Kakati Empire.  They defeated them and took away all the wealth and treasure of the umpire who had not lost for so long, including Kohinoor, from Warangal and sent it to their sultanate in Delhi. And after reaching Delhi, Alauddin Khilji had an official named Khwaja [ __ ].  He was given the task to do the valuation of all the treasure that had come from Warangal. So at this time Kohinoor appears and Khilji also asks at this time, how much would it cost?  So Khwaja [ __ ] who was given this task says that this is a very unique thing.   There is only one such thing in the world whose price no one can calculate.  And from here Khilji comes to know about Kohinoor. Now this diamond had come to Khilji but some time after its arrival, Alauddin Khilji died.  Malik Kafuz kills Khilji's children.  Then he himself dies.  So many problems occur back to back that the Khilji dynasty collapses.  And then after this the Kohinoor Diamond went to the Tughlaq dynasty.  Then he lost too.  In this way Kohinoor passed to multiple kings and dynasties.  And because so many kings had lost, the superstition spread in the surrounding areas that whoever goes to it brings misfortune.  So at this time the general public started associating Kohinoor with black magic.  Now what happens next?  Passing from one king to another, the Kohinoor Diamond reached Babar.  Babur and his son Humayun defeated Ibrahim Lodi and brought this Kohinoor diamond with them. And at this time, Babar's son Humayun had also asked Babar that so many people are after Kohinoor.  What is so special about it? how much it cost?  So Babar had said at that time that this single diamond can bear the expenses of the entire world for one day.  At this time it was not named Kohinoor.  Babar used to call it Diamond.  Now after this, Babar died on 26th of December 1530. After that his son Humayun takes over the throne.  But the entire umpire had become weak.  Seeing the opportunity, Sher Shah Suri attacks Humayun. Now when Humayun gets upset and starts losing, he runs away from there.  But while running away, somehow he keeps the Kohinoor with himself and to save his life, he leaves for Persia (which is Iran in today's date) in July 1544 so that he can survive.  Now when Humayun sets out towards Persia with the Kohinoor diamond, he stops in between to perform ablution at the time of prayer and takes out the Kohinoor diamond and keeps it on the side, and in the process he forgets what the Kohinoor is. Now Humayun became very worried but he had a courtier named Jauhar with him.  Luckily he finds it and then somehow the Kohinoor again comes to Humayun. Now after this, Humayun reaches Persia in the beginning of the year 1544. Reaching there, King Tamasp asks for help from them. Tamask keeps Humayun by providing him security.  And then when Humayun remained safe for many years, he had nothing more to offer in return. He gives his Kohinoor diamond to Tamas.  So in this way, the ownership of Kohinoor goes out of India for the first time and reaches Persia.  That means it reaches what is today's Iran. But this lasts for a very short time.  After this, many things happen due to which Kohinoor again comes back to India.  What happened was that the control of Kohinoor was now with Tamasp and Tamas was a Shia Muslim.  The Sunni led Ottoman umpire was moving very fast.  So Tamas became a little insecure and he also tried to bring together all the Shia Muslims in the world.  So at that time in India, King Burhan Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar Sultanate was a very powerful Shia Muslim in that area. So Tamas wanted to unite them so that all the Shias could be together. In the year 1547, he sends his ambassador Mehtar Jamal with Kohinoor and gifts it to King Burhan Nizam Shah to join him and in this way Kohinoor comes back to India. Now after coming inside India, Kohinoor started getting transferred from one king to another.  Whoever was powerful, would take possession of Kohinoor in some way or the other and then in this way Kohinoor reached Shah Jahan around the 7th of July 1656. When Kohinoor came to Shah Jahan, he became very obsessed with it.  Shah Jahan had kept it separately in a royal jewel box.  And there was a famous diamond cutter named Hartsio Borio in Shahjahan's court.  And Shahjahan gives him the task. This rare Kohinoor that we have, please make it beautiful somehow. Whatever money is required for this, we will provide it. After discussing diamond cutting with Shah Jahan, Hartsio starts cutting and polishing Kohinoor so that the reflection of light increases further.  It looked more beautiful.  But in doing this, Hartsio reduced the 793 carat Koinur to 280 carats.  And when Shah Jahan sees this thing, he gets very angry.  Far from paying the money, he instead imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000 on Hartancio.  And when it became small, Shah Jahan got Takht-e-Tosh made, the most expensive Peacock Throne in the world at that time.  It was under process.  This was a very unique peacock throne.  Inside it, Shah Jahan placed sapphires, rubies, emeralds, pearls, several kgs of gold and unique stones worth more than 500 pounds.  The Peacock Throne was more costly than the Taj Mahal. So the Peacock Throne was already this expensive.  It was more expensive than the Taj Mahal. After that, when Kohinoor was also placed on it , the Peacock Throne became even more unique. And this Peacock Throne was discussed far and wide. And when the Peacock Throne was ready, Shah Jahan placed the Kohinoor and started sitting comfortably on it.  And soon after this, i.e. in the year 1658, Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb removed Shah Jahan and put him in prison in Agra Fort and became the king himself. But after becoming the king, Aurangzeb did one thing.  He did not get the formal condolence done in Delhi and even refused to sit on the Peacock Throne on which the Kohinoor was placed. Some people say this even today that this was the reason why Aurangzeb ruled for a long time. He did not die early.  And then after Aurangzeb more kings came.  He also used the Peacock Throne.  But by the time Mohammad Shah Rangeela came, the Mughal umpire had become very weak.  They were fighting amongst themselves. Now at this time Nadir Shah who was sitting in Persia saw an opportunity here that the Mughals had become weak and they had a lot of treasure.   It is Kohinoor and taking advantage of the opportunity, Nadir Shah attacks Mohammad Shah Rangeela in the year 1738. [MUSIC] 17 Mark Major Turning Point and Nadir Shah was not supposed to rule over India. He had come to rob the empty treasury. So after losing the battle, Nadir Shah took away the entire treasure of Mohammad Shah Rangeela.  The Peacock Throne was broken and all the diamonds etc. studded on it were taken out. Mohammad Shah Rangeela gave everything. Gave away all the treasure.  But he hid one thing, Kohinoor, inside his turban so that Nadir Shah could not find it.  Now Nadir Shah had already heard a lot about Kohinoor.  He tried to find out and found out that there was a courtesan inside Rangeela's court, Noor Bai.  He secretly told Nadir Shah that Rangeela had hidden the Kohinoor in his turban. Now there is a very old tradition in which the king exchanges his turban. So Nadir Shah deliberately told Rangeela that we have to exchange turbans.  So Mohammad Shah Rangeela shows a lot of reluctance in the beginning.  But due to compulsion he has to exchange his turban and as soon as he is exchanging the turban.  The Kohinoor slips out of his turban and falls down.  And as it falls down, Kohinoor comes out from Nadir Shah's mouth, which means Mountain of Light and from here Kohinoor got its name, which people call Kohinoor. Alam Arai Nadri is the first authentic source in which it was first told how the name of Kohinoor was used by Nadir Shah and then after taking all the treasure, Nadir Shah takes Kohinoor from India to Persia and in this way Kohinoor goes back from India. Now after getting Kohinoor, bad times started for Nadir Shah also. They are also killed.  The entire umpire becomes weak.  Nadir Shah's treasury starts getting looted. And at this time, Nadir Shah's trusted guard General Ahmed Shah Durrani goes to Afghanistan with Kohinoor and starts his own Durrani Empire there and in this way Kohinoor becomes a part of the Afghan Royal Family and then year after year it is passed on in the family and in the year 1803, Kohinoor comes to Shah Shuja Durrani and as soon as Kohinoor came, bad times started for him too. His cousins ​​rebel.   Due to fear of which, he first gives Kohinoor to his wife Wafa Begum and his brother Zaman Shah and sends them towards Punjab under the protection of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. And as soon as he sends his wife and brother here, the military commander of Shah Shuja arrests him.  Now as soon as this happens, Shah Shuja's wife Wafa Begum goes to Maharaja Ranjit Singh.  She asks him for help and tells him to save her husband Shah Shuja.  In return, I will give you the most precious thing in the world, Kohinoor.  And this was the time when Maharaja Ranjit Singh had asked him what is so special about Kohinoor that it is so valuable ?  So Wafa Begum says at that time that if five strong wrestlers throw stones in all four directions and towards the sky, then the distance covered by it if filled with gold, even then it will still be more than the value of Kohinoor.  And then after this the deal is fixed that the most precious Kohinoor will be given to Maharaja Ranjit Singh and in return he will get Shah Shuja released and bring him back. And one more thing was fixed in exchange for Kohinoor that Maharaja Ranjit Singh will give Rs. 3 lakh and 50 horses in exchange for it.  Now as soon as the deal is done, Maharaja Ranjit Singh uses his forces to rescue Shah Shuja very quickly and bring him back.  Now the deal was that after Shah Shuja returned, Kohinoor was to be returned to him and his wife. But both of them start showing reluctance. But after multiple discussions, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh put pressure on him and got the house terraced, then Shah Shuja officially gave the Kohinoor Diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh around October 1813. And Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji was very happy after getting the possession of Kohinoor. He liked Kohinoor very much.  So daily whenever he went out, he used to tie this on his forehead. But after this he kept it in the royal treasury and then wore it only on special occasions. And two more diamonds were placed next to this Kohinoor diamond.  This is his image. Now after this, by the year 1830, the influence of the British became very strong in India.  And the talk about the Sikh umpire's treasure and Kohinoor was spread far and wide.  And the British also had their eyes on this treasure.  The British had heard so much about Kohinoor that in the same year 1830, British officer W.G. Osborne himself went to the umpire’s court and requested Maharaja Ranjit Singh to see Kohinoor once because he had heard so much about it.  Once you show it, it gets shown as well. He has also written about this incident in his book Court and Camp of Ranjit Singh. And this was the time when the British wanted to gain control over the Sikh Empire and its treasury at any cost.  But at that time the Sikh umpire was very strong. Now what happens in the meantime is that the year 1838 starts and Maharaja Ranjit Singh's health starts deteriorating.  And this was the time when Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji had started making huge donations.  He also asked to donate Kohinoor to the Jagannath Temple. All these things are mentioned in the Sikh Court of Official Record Ummad ul Tawarikh. So the donations were going on but when it came to the donation of Kohinoor, Beliram, the treasurer of Raja Ranjit Singh, got upset and refused to donate it saying that it was such a precious diamond.  It is the property of the Sikh umpire. This is not personal property.  Therefore it should not be donated.  But then amidst all this, Maharaja Ranjit Singh died on 27th June 1839. Then after this his son Kharak Singh takes over the throne.  But Kohinoor is not donated.  But as soon as he becomes king and gets possession of Kohinoor , someone gives him slow poison. He also died on the fifth of November 1840. Then Raja Naunihal Singh takes over the throne.  They also get Kohinoor.  At the same time, the Hazaribagh gate also falls on them. They too die. Then Kohinoor comes to Sher Singh.  He too was executed on 15th of September 1843. So in every house, people started talking about the fact that this Kohinoor is cursed.  Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji had rightly said that it should be donated to the temple.  And this whole story of Kohinoor was published in the daily newspapers and everyone in England also read it.  Kohinoor had become very famous in England also.  The Queen also became very interested in Kohinoor.  So after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Sikh umpires started dying one after the other.  There was a leadership crisis and the Sikh umpire became very weak. Apart from his 5 year old son Dilip Singh, no one else was left.  And then, out of compulsion, 5 year old Dilip Singh was made the king in the year 1843.  And his mother Jind Kaur used to take care of all these things. And the British found this to be the best time to exert their control over the Sikh umpire. And then on 11th of December 1845, the British attacked the Sikh umpire and took control of him.  And Maharaja Dilip Singh's mother was put under house arrest inside the fort and he took all the political power in his hands. And what do the British do after this?   He gets the seven year old Maharaja Dilip Singh to sign the Treaty of Lahore.  It is signed twice.  I will tell you at once.  There were many things in this treaty. But through this treaty, Kohinoor was officially taken under the control of the British. These things were written about Kohinoor in Article 3 of this treaty. You please pause it and see once. And because of the Treaty of Lahore, Kohinoor was now officially taken under the control of the British.  And because there have been huge battles over the control of the ownership of Kohinoor. So on paper he took it with him.  Along with this, a ceremony was also organised on the 7th of December 1849 in which Kohinoor was handed over to the British in front of everyone. And then after this, it was planned to reserve Kohinoor for the Queen and gift it to her and it was announced that now the rightful owner of Kohinoor will be the Queen.  Now after this the next task was to take Kohinoor to England to the Queen.  But before that it was decided that Kohinoor would be gifted to the Queen to impress her.  So if we tell her the interesting story behind this, she will be very impressed. And for this task, Governor General Dalhousie called Assistant Magistrate Theo Matt Calfe and gave him the task to find out about the history of Kohinoor and its factual history as quickly as possible and submit a report and there should not be anything wrong in it and in a very short time Matcafe collected details about Kohinoor, from where it was mined, what was its location, how it came to Nadir Shah and the story that was going around about its bad luck and misfortune, and submitted a report, but this was a story of miss, misfortune and bad luck. All these things were also being published in the newspapers of England.  So the people of England were also very excited that the Kohinoor was going to come to our country in some time.  Now after this the next task was to take Kohinoor from India to England.  So firstly Kohinoor was safely brought from Lahore Fort to Mumbai on the second of February 1850. And then on the sixth of April 1850, Captain Lockyer took it in the British Royal Navy ship HMS Media and took it towards England. Now Kohinoor is in the ship.  So that no one gets suspicious about it, Kohinoor is kept in a normal box and a lock is put on it which has two keys and one key is shared by Ramsay and the other by the Captain. Now after this the ship leaves for England but after some time cholera spreads in the ship. When the captain goes down to the bottom of the ship, he finds two crew members dead because of illness.  So these people make some arrangements and stay in Mauritius.  Treatment etc. is done there.  But after leaving from there, when we go a little further, we also get stuck in a storm etc.  And then somehow, after facing all the difficulties, it reaches Poss Smooth Port of England on the second of July 1850. And here in London, there was eager waiting.  There was only talk about Kohinoor everywhere.  The newspapers were filled with details of Kohinoor only. [MUSIC] She's so excited.  Now what happens is that on one side the Kohinoor had just reached England.  On the other hand, the Prime Minister of England, Robert Peel, was going towards Constitution Hill on a horse.  Suddenly the horse throws him down and crushes him, and he dies exactly on the same day on which Kohinoor reaches England. Now, on one hand, the PM has died.  On the other hand, Queen Victoria leaves Cambridge House and goes to the house of her uncle Prince Adolphus who had died. All of a sudden, a man named Robert Francis takes out an iron rod and attacks Queen Victoria. All this news was being published simultaneously in the news.  On one side there was Kohinoor and on the other side all the incidents that were happening were being published.  So people started associating Kohinoor with black magic and thought that bringing it might be a mistake.  Now on the next day, i.e., third of July 1850, the Queen had to receive Kohinoor. John, who was the President of the Board of Control, had to hand over Kohinoor to the Queen. And when the Queen was receiving the world's most famous and precious diamond, one of her eyes was black and she had an injury on her forehead.  Now Kohinoor had reached the Queen.  The Queen finds the shape of Kohinoor a bit bad. So at that time David Brewster was also known as the Father of Modern Experimental Optics.  She gives the task of correcting Konur's shape to them. And in return David Brewster took 8000 British pounds.  And by correcting the shape and cutting of Kohinoor, it was made more beautiful.  But in the process of doing this its weight reduced again. Now only 105.6 carats i.e. 21.12 grams of Kohinoor was left.  Now this thing had happened but after some time in the year 1861 when Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert also dies then the story starts again that only a female can save herself from this. Otherwise, if there is any male then it will bring a lot of bad luck for him. So this was the time when Kohinoor was put into the Queen's crown so that it would remain exclusive only to the female members of the British Royal Family. And if there is any male member of the Royal Family then he/she cannot wear Kohinoor.  In fact, even today, only females wear it in the royal family.  Now see, after this, in the year 1947 when our country became independent and the time came for the British to leave, our government gave a formal request that Kohinoor should be returned to India, but the British completely refused at that time. Then there was no discussion about Kohinoor for a long time. But then what happens in the year 1953 is that the coronation of Queen Elizabeth takes place.  At that time, India once again makes a request to take back Kohinoor.  But again the request is rejected. Till now, all the requests for taking back Kohinoor were being made by India through formal discussions and letters. No court case was filed.  Now when all these things were happening, in the year 1976, Pakistan also jumped into it after seeing India. Pakistan says that Kohinoor is the heritage of Lahore.  Lahore was the capital of the Sikh Empire at that time and it was through the Treaty of Lahore that you people took Coonoor. So give it back to us.  Now seeing this, the Taliban also jumped into it. He says that Kohinoor has also been a part of the Durani Empire. So we should get it back.  We have a right to it.  By doing this, Iran also says that we should meet. Now after seeing all these things the British refused to allow it to all the countries.  He rejects everyone's request. He simply says one thing that Kohinoor has legally gone to Britain.  Therefore, you have no right over it.  Now after this, for a long time there was no discussion about Kohinoor in India.  And then comes the year 1997.  At this time Kuldeep Nair, who was also a journalist earlier, became an MP in the Rajya Sabha.  And a year after becoming an MP, that is in the year 1998, he gathered 50 more MPs with him and got them to sign a petition and again appealed to the British Government that Kohinoor is a symbol of colonial plunder.  It should be returned to India as soon as possible.  And these were the 50 MPs who had signed this petition. Dr. Manmohan Singh was also present in this. He also signed this petition.  There is a lot of noise about bringing back Kohinoor.  A lot of news is also made. Looking at the public sentiments, the then external foreign minister Jaswant Singh had said that Kohinoor would be brought back. But the matter stops right there.  Then after this comes the year 2002.  At this time Queen Elizabeth's helper dies. And a crown containing Kohinoor was placed on his coffin. Now all these things were being telecast live within India as well.  And seeing these things the common people of India start saying again. Again she demands that Kohinoor should be returned.  The Sikh community in India also got very angry that Kohinoor had been the legacy of the Sikh umpire for a long time. It should somehow be brought back and installed in the Amritsar temple. At the same time, the officials of Jagannath Puri Temple also demanded that Kohinoor be brought back at any cost. Maharaja Ranjit Singh's wish was that Kohinoor should go to Jagannath Puri Temple. And at this time, these things were getting published in the newspapers almost every day and back to back PILs were being filed in the courts so that the Indian Government could somehow put pressure on the British Government and get Kohinoor back.  India has a right on this. This is a part of India's heritage.  Out of all the PILs, one PIL was filed in 2016 by All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front NGO.  He had filed a PIL and requested the government to take some steps.   The case went on in the court for several days and on behalf of the government, Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar said that Kohinoor was neither stolen nor did the British take it away forcibly. This was given of his own free will. So we cannot make such claims and if we make such claims then tomorrow some other country will take some thing or the other from us and claim it.  Now as soon as this news comes out, people's sentiments start turning against the government.  The news starts getting made and when the matter gets out of hand, then the government reverses its stand and says that India belongs only to Kohinoor.  But there are difficulties in bringing it legally. Challenges are still coming. But we will take whatever steps are necessary to get it back. And actually, there were legal hurdles in bringing Konur back.  The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act of 1972 allows the government to claim ownership of its valuable historical art. But there was a problem in this as it was applicable only for items manufactured after the year 1972. India could not legally use it to bring back Kohinoor. And secondly, both India and Britain have signed the UNESCO Convention and its Article Seven allows that a country can take back its cultural items or treasures by taking legal action against another country. But there was the same problem in this as well that both the countries had signed this convention for the items issued after the year 1970. So the matter got stuck here as well. And as per Article 1 of the convention which was signed by both the countries, there was also a rule that if there is any item of cultural heritage, then it will be seen from which country that item originally came. Like where did you find it for the first time or what is the proof of that thing.  But here also the problem arises that with time, everything including the country's state has changed.  First there was only India, then Pakistan was also formed. Apart from that, Kohinoor has travelled to every area from India to Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and was colonised by the British at that time. So actually there is a conflict as to which country it will be considered as at that time from where it originated. But even after that the common people of India did not stop.  Many PILs keep going to Indian courts back to back year after year. And then, fed up, the Supreme Court dismissed the PIL and gave a statement that we cannot get Kohinoor back by passing an order for a foreign country. So this problem arose here as well.  But even after all these things, the pressure from the general public is so much that the government has to give statements from time to time and fight a legal battle with the British government to bring back Kohinoor. And it has happened many times that India has put forward its arguments very strongly. In which India says that the Kohinoor which was given to the British was not given willingly.  At that time Dilip Singh was very young and the British put his mother under house arrest and became the guardian themselves and got the Kohinoor legally signed.  And India repeatedly says that Kohinoor is not just a diamond for India but it is a cultural heritage.  This is an artifact for India which represents the culture of India. And India also says that no matter how much the British say that they have a legal right over it, the actual fact is that the British colonized India and misused their power to take Kohinoor to their country.  In fact, the proof of Archaeological Survey also clearly states that Kohinoor originated in India, within the Golconda region. [Music] And at the same time, the Indian rulers have had the ownership of Kohinoor for the longest time. But the British have only one argument on all these things, that we have acquired Kohinoor legally through the Treaty of Lahore. This thing is clearly mentioned in Article 3 and for the last 150 years Kohinoor has been a part of the Crown. And if we give away Kohinoor like this, then all the museums of the world, including the museum in England, will become empty.  Because in this way some country or the other will claim the artifact in some other country's museum and demand it back. And one thing I told you earlier was that the British had organised a small ceremony.  After that he took Kohinoor.  British officials also give reference to it. And along with this the British say that even if we give it, then to whom should we give it?  Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, so many countries are claiming Koinoor.  Everyone is saying that Koinoor is our heritage.  So who has the real ownership ?  This too is not easy to find out. So these are all the problems due to which Kohinoor could not be brought back.  But the demand of the general public even today is that Kohinoor is a part of India's heritage and the government should bring it back somehow. And along with this, its superstition due to misfortune is still talked about by people.  Still you will find multiple writers who talk about its curses. When Queen Elizabeth died on 8th of September 2022 and after that King Charles, who was a male, became the king.  So after that, in 204, he was diagnosed with cancer.  So again the stories about the curse of Kohinoor and black magic started because even though the king did not keep Kohinoor with himself but after the death of Elizabeth technically the ownership of Kohinoor had come to him.  One had come by mail.  That is why all this happened and people always give the example that before Kohinoor came to England, Asia, Africa, Europe, America, Australia all came under the British Empire. People used to say that the sun never sets in the British Empire.  But if you look at today's date, Britain has become a small island nation and there are still multiple writers who write that this has happened because of the curse of Conur.
