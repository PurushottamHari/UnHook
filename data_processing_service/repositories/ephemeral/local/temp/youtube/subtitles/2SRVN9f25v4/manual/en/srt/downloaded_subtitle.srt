1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
As soon as Kohinoor reached the soil of England

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,560
, the Queen was hit on the head with an iron rod.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,440

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,679
Kuldeep Nair reached Rajya Sabha, got 50 MPs

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,679
and Manmohan Singh ji to sign for Kohinoor.   The

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,679
 

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,240
Taliban also jumped in saying that the Kohinoor

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,480
is ours.  When the Queen received Kohinoor in front of the whole world,

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,119
she got a black eye

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,119
and an injury on her head.

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,519
What is there in Kohinoor that India,

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,520
Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan all are saying that they

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,680
want it.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,079
Bad times started for the person to whom Kohinoor went other than the female.

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,079

16
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:47,160
Kohinoor was of 795 carats but

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,079
in the end only 105 carats were

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,320
left.  Due to all these legal problems,

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,079
Kohinoor has not been

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,520
able to return to India till date.  In Article 3 of the Treaty of Lahore, it is

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,079
clearly written that

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,490
as soon as Kohinoor fell down from the turban,

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,389
Nadir Shah said no to it.

24
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,389
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,119
Now look, in business just earning money is

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,760
not enough.  It is important to understand timely whether the money is coming or is stuck

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,840
and where is it going.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,400
Therefore, it

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,880

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,119
is important for businesses to keep track of accounts receivable and accounts payable.  Now if you do all this manually, it will

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,040
take time and mistakes will also

32
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
occur.  That's why smart businesses are using

with Ood Accounting app for free.  I have

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,160
given the link in the description.  So let's

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,319
come back to the topic.  Look, today there is

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,200
Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh, so

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,520
around the year 1306, this

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,840
entire area was a part of the Golconda region

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,720
and the Krishna river used to pass from this side.  The

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
Kakatiya Dynasty ruled over this entire area

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,120
and this Golconda

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
region was the only region in the world at that time

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,760
where diamonds were

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
mined.

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
Diamond mining had not taken place anywhere else before this.

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,599
What the locals here used to do was

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,000

69
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,680
extract diamonds on a daily basis using ancient placer mining, which was a technique.

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,879
Basically, in this technique, these people used to mine diamonds from the

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,200
alveolar deposits near rivers

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,040
using bamboo sieve

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,879
and the

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,120
diamonds were also traded from here all over the world

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,360
and this process continued for a long time.

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,640
Now what happens in a day,

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,159
what does a group do in the same year i.e. year 1306

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
?  I was mining in this area

79
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,000
and while mining I found a very

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,800
unique diamond.  At that time its weight was

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,560
793 carats.  That means

82
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,640
158.6 grams.  He had exceptional clarity.  The

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,959

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
clarity was at the level of what today we call a D grade diamond.

85
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,280
Now when they found this diamond, all these

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
people together went and gave this diamond to the

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
rulers of the Kakatiya Dynasty.

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
And then in this way, for the first time in the year 1306,

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,640

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,319
this diamond came to the rulers of the Kakatiya Dynasty, which later came to be

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,760
known as Kohinoor.  Look, in the details that

92
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,360
I am giving you, you will find more things

93
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
if you go on the internet.  But the

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,840
rulers of the Kakatiya Dynasty are

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,599
considered the first documented owners of the Kohinoor Diamond.

96
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
And for the sake of understanding,

97
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,439
I will now call this diamond Kohinoor Diamond.  But

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
its name becomes Kohinoor later on.

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
I will tell him now.  And let

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,239
me add one more thing in this before telling you further

101
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,319
that whatever details I am

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
telling you about Koinoor Diamond, there are

103
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
different stories and

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
different details about it.  But I have

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,159
picked only those details for which maximum

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,840
records and facts are available.  For example,

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,519

108
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,919
I chose the story of Golconda because it has the closest geological

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,239
evidence and the writers' records are related to

110
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
it.  For example, according to the evidence,

111
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,639
Kohinoor is a Type 2A diamond

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,120
in which there is no nitrogen impurity.

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,639
And it is mined using an ancient placer mining

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
technique.  And

115
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,400
according to the experts,

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,160
all the characteristics of this Koinoor diamond are

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,479

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,880
exactly like the diamonds found in the Golconda region.  And many

119
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,800
seismologists like Harsh K Gupta

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
have also officially confirmed that

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
Kohinoor is from the Golconda region.

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Even in 2023, research was published in the Journal of Earth System

123
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,560
Science.

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,400
In which it was told that Kohinoor Diamond

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,800
originated from Kimber Light Pipe and the

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,800
colourful wines of Golconda region were

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,680
very famous for Kimber Light Field.

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,520

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
I am telling you this story on the basis of satellite images, geochemical analysis and the closest proofs that have been matched so far.

131
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,680
So what happens after this is that the

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,080
diamond reaches the rulers of the Katakia Dynasty.

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,560
And

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,560
one thing common among their rulers was that they respected their family deity

135
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,039
Bhadrakali ji a lot.  They also had a

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,120
huge Bhadrakali temple in their capital Warangal.

137
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,960
So when this diamond

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,360
came to Kakti rulers, they decided

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,600
that they will get it

140
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,160
installed in the left eye of Goddess Bhadrakali inside the temple.

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,320
And when this happened, after some time, this

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,479
superstition also spread in the surrounding area that

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,800
this was done because whoever will

144
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,720
own this diamond will rule very strongly

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,800
but his bad luck will start.

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,800

147
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,910
[MUSIC]

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,039
Only God and woman can wear this diamond without any

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,720
harm.  That's why this was

150
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,039
done.  Now look, the line I

151
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,039
just said that the diamond will bring misfortune,

152
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,360
people in the surrounding areas were talking about it.

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,680
Whenever there is talk of Kohinoor, this

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
line about misfortune and curse will always

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,720
come in front of you.  And let me tell you one thing about this

156
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
that if you go out to find its proof then

157
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,479
only one thing will come up that

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,160
this has been said in the Lost Hindu Text of the year 1306.

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,240
But its direct citation is

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,080
not mentioned in any Veda, Purana or any classical Hindu scriptures.

162
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,080
But the reference given by people is the

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,319

164
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,639
details given about Shyam Mantaka Mani in chapter 56 of Dasam Skandh of Bhagavat Purana.

165
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,120
People compare it with the story of Kohinoor's

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,479
misfortune and

167
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,080
this thing is also backed by Indian historians and research

168
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,560
scholars.  So, what I mean to

169
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,720
say is that actually this

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,639

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,400
story of curse and misfortune of Kohinoor Diamond is that whoever

172
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,479
gets it, bad times will start for him.

173
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,039
Only females can wear it.  This has

174
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,800
emerged as a secondary and tertiary source.

175
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,720
Meaning that its original source was not found

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
but British, Indian and French writers

177
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
and historians spoke so much about it

178
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,960
that people started writing about it again and again

179
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
which started being considered as proof.  So now

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,680
see, when Kohinoor diamond came to Kakatiya Empire, at

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
that time Kakatiya Empire was at

182
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,319
its peak.  Wealth, power, diamonds,

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,240
sports, strong administration, there was

184
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,479
no one to defeat them anywhere.  But

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,880
some time after the arrival of Kohinoor,

186
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,520
Alauddin Khilji of Delhi Sultanate sent his general

187
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,919
Malik Kafur to attack the Kakati Empire.  They

188
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
defeated them and took away

189
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
all the wealth and treasure of the umpire who had not lost for so long, including

190
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,800
Kohinoor, from

191
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,479
Warangal and sent it to their sultanate in Delhi.

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
And after reaching Delhi,

193
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,960
Alauddin Khilji had an official named Khwaja

194
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,280
[ __ ].  He was given the task to do the

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,440
valuation of all the treasure that had come from Warangal.

196
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
So at this time Kohinoor

197
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,639
appears and Khilji also asks

198
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,479
at this time, how much would it cost?  So

199
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,080
Khwaja [ __ ] who was given this task

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,160
says that this is a very unique thing.   There is

201
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,639
only one such thing in the world whose

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,880
price no one can calculate.  And

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,039
from here Khilji comes to know about Kohinoor.

204
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,720
Now this diamond had come to Khilji

205
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,800
but some time after its arrival,

206
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,800
Alauddin Khilji died.  Malik

207
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
Kafuz kills Khilji's children.  Then

208
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
he himself dies.  So many problems occur back to back that the

209
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
Khilji dynasty

210
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
collapses.  And then

211
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
after this the Kohinoor Diamond

212
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,360
went to the Tughlaq dynasty.  Then he lost too.  In this

213
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,840
way Kohinoor passed to multiple kings and

214
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,720
dynasties.  And because so many

215
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,639
kings had lost, the superstition spread

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,400
in the surrounding areas that whoever goes to it

217
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,800
brings misfortune.  So at

218
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,960
this time the general public

219
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,720
started associating Kohinoor with black magic.  Now

220
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,599
what happens next?  Passing from one king

221
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,599
to another, the Kohinoor Diamond

222
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,080
reached Babar.  Babur and his

223
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,080
son Humayun defeated Ibrahim Lodi and

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,399
brought this Kohinoor diamond with them.

225
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,399
And at this time, Babar's son Humayun had

226
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,480
also asked Babar that

227
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
so many people are after Kohinoor.  What is so special about it?

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,320
how much it cost?  So Babar had

229
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
said at that time that

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,800
this single diamond can bear the expenses of the entire world for one day.  At this time

231
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
it was not named Kohinoor.  Babar used to

232
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,399
call it Diamond.  Now after this,

233
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Babar died on 26th of December 1530.

234
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,760
After that his son Humayun

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
takes over the throne.  But the entire umpire had

236
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,120
become weak.  Seeing the opportunity, Sher Shah

237
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,120
Suri attacks Humayun.

238
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,040
Now when Humayun gets upset and starts losing,

239
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,600
he runs away from there.  But while

240
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,320
running away, somehow he

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,440
keeps the Kohinoor with himself and to

242
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,279
save his life, he leaves for Persia (which is

243
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,959
Iran in today's date) in July 1544

244
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,560
so that he can survive.  Now when

245
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,880
Humayun sets out towards Persia with the

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,640
Kohinoor diamond, he stops in between to

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,399
perform ablution at the time of prayer and takes

248
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
out the Kohinoor diamond and keeps it on the side,

249
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,959
and in the process he forgets what the Kohinoor is.

250
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,360
Now Humayun became very

251
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,560
worried but he had

252
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,560
a courtier named Jauhar with him.  Luckily he finds it

253
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,800
and then somehow the

254
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,200
Kohinoor again comes to Humayun.

255
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,880
Now after this,

256
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Humayun reaches Persia in the beginning of the year 1544.

257
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,040
Reaching there, King Tamasp

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,800
asks for help from them.

259
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,720
Tamask

260
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,480
keeps Humayun by providing him security.  And then when

261
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Humayun remained safe for many years, he had nothing more to offer in return.

262
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,120
He gives his Kohinoor

263
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,560
diamond to Tamas.  So in

264
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,959
this way, the ownership of Kohinoor goes

265
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,040
out of India for the first time and

266
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,720
reaches Persia.  That means it reaches what is today's Iran.

267
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,480
But this

268
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,920
lasts for a very short time.  After this, many

269
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
things happen due to which

270
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,600
Kohinoor again comes back to India.  What happened was that the

271
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,800
control of Kohinoor was now

272
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,519
with Tamasp and Tamas was a

273
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,079
Shia Muslim.  The Sunni led Ottoman umpire was

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,240
moving very fast.  So Tamas became a

275
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,480
little insecure and he also

276
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,640
tried to bring

277
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,200
together all the Shia Muslims in the world.  So

278
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,079
at that time in India,

279
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,000
King Burhan Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar Sultanate was a very

280
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
powerful Shia Muslim in that area.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,040
So Tamas wanted to unite them

282
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,399
so that all the Shias could be together.

283
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,720
In the year 1547, he sends his ambassador Mehtar

284
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,360
Jamal with Kohinoor and gifts it to

285
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,680
King Burhan Nizam Shah to join him

286
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,680
and in this way

287
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
Kohinoor comes back to India.

288
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,160
Now after coming inside India, Kohinoor

289
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,560

290
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,399
started getting transferred from one king to another.  Whoever was powerful, would take

291
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,120

292
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,160
possession of Kohinoor in some way or the other and then in this way

293
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,480
Kohinoor reached Shah Jahan around the 7th of July 1656.

294
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,320

295
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
When Kohinoor came to Shah Jahan, he became very

296
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,200
obsessed with it.  Shah Jahan had

297
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,040

298
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,399
kept it separately in a royal jewel box.  And there was a

299
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,480
famous diamond cutter named Hartsio

300
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,880
Borio in Shahjahan's court.  And Shahjahan gives him the task.

301
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,600
This rare Kohinoor that we have, please make it

302
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,160
beautiful somehow.

303
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,839
Whatever money is required for this, we will provide it.

304
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,399
After discussing diamond cutting with Shah Jahan,

305
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,240
Hartsio starts cutting and polishing Kohinoor

306
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,079
so that the reflection of light

307
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,079
increases further.  It

308
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,760
looked more beautiful.  But in doing this,

309
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,880
Hartsio reduced the 793 carat

310
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,560
Koinur to 280 carats.  And

311
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,880
when Shah Jahan sees this thing, he gets very

312
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,680
angry.  Far from paying the money, he

313
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,760
instead

314
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,760
imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000 on Hartancio.  And when it became

315
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
small, Shah Jahan got

316
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,160

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,920
Takht-e-Tosh made, the most expensive Peacock Throne in the world at that time.  It

318
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,000
was under process.  This was a very

319
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,079
unique peacock throne.  Inside it, Shah Jahan

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,560

321
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,200

322
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,600
placed sapphires, rubies, emeralds, pearls, several kgs of gold and unique stones worth more than 500 pounds.  The Peacock Throne was more costly than the Taj Mahal.

323
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,519
So the Peacock Throne was already

324
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,839
this expensive.  It was more expensive than the Taj Mahal.

325
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,680
After that, when Kohinoor was also placed on it

326
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
, the Peacock Throne became even more unique.

327
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,079
And this Peacock Throne was discussed far and wide.

328
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,240
And when the Peacock Throne was ready,

329
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,959
Shah Jahan placed the Kohinoor and

330
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,560
started sitting comfortably on it.  And soon

331
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,760
after this, i.e. in the year 1658, Shah Jahan's

332
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,000
son Aurangzeb removed Shah Jahan and

333
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,240
put him in prison in Agra Fort and became the king himself.

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,800
But after becoming the king, Aurangzeb did

335
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,839
one thing.  He did

336
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,920
not get the formal condolence done in Delhi and even refused to sit on the Peacock

337
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680
Throne on which the Kohinoor was placed.

338
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,760
Some people

339
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,320
say this even today that this was the reason why

340
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Aurangzeb ruled for a long time.

341
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,639
He did not die early.  And then

342
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
after Aurangzeb more kings came.  He also

343
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
used the Peacock Throne.  But by the time Mohammad Shah

344
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,279
Rangeela came, the Mughal umpire had become very

345
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,000
weak.  They were fighting amongst themselves.

346
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,720
Now at this time

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Nadir Shah who was sitting in Persia

348
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,120
saw an opportunity here that the Mughals had become weak

349
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,000
and they had a lot of treasure.   It

350
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,279
is Kohinoor and taking advantage of the opportunity, Nadir Shah

351
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,680
attacks Mohammad Shah Rangeela in the year 1738.

352
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:48,760

353
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:51,480
[MUSIC]

354
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,639
17 Mark Major Turning

355
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Point and Nadir Shah was not supposed to rule over India.

356
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,399
He had come to rob the empty treasury.

357
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,880
So after losing the battle,

358
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,360

359
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,120
Nadir Shah took away the entire treasure of Mohammad Shah Rangeela.  The Peacock Throne was

360
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,279
broken and all the

361
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,279
diamonds etc. studded on it were taken out.

362
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,600
Mohammad Shah Rangeela gave everything.

363
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,000
Gave away all the treasure.  But

364
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,760
he hid one thing, Kohinoor, inside his turban

365
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,519
so that Nadir Shah could not find it.  Now

366
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,519
Nadir Shah had already

367
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,440
heard a lot about Kohinoor.  He

368
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,880
tried to find out and found out that there was a courtesan inside Rangeela's court,

369
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,639
Noor Bai.  He

370
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,560
secretly told Nadir Shah that Rangeela had

371
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,320
hidden the Kohinoor in his turban.

372
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,320
Now there is a very old tradition in which the

373
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,440
king exchanges his turban.

374
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,199
So Nadir Shah deliberately

375
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,959
told Rangeela that we have to exchange turbans.  So

376
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,360
Mohammad Shah Rangeela shows a

377
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,680
lot of reluctance in the beginning.  But due to compulsion

378
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,680
he has to exchange his turban

379
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,839
and as soon as he is exchanging the turban.  The

380
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,079
Kohinoor slips out of his turban and

381
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,079
falls down.  And as it falls down,

382
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,800

383
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,800
Kohinoor comes out from Nadir Shah's mouth, which means Mountain of Light and

384
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,000
from here Kohinoor got its name, which people

385
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,800
call Kohinoor.

386
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,639
Alam Arai Nadri is the first authentic

387
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,560
source in which it was first

388
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,399
told how the name of Kohinoor was

389
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,720
used by Nadir Shah

390
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,040
and then after taking all the treasure, Nadir Shah

391
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,560
takes Kohinoor from India to

392
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,399
Persia and in this way

393
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Kohinoor goes back from India.

394
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,800
Now after getting Kohinoor,

395
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,480
bad times started for Nadir Shah also.

396
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,639
They are also killed.  The entire

397
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,399
umpire becomes weak.  Nadir

398
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,160
Shah's treasury starts getting looted.

399
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,720
And at this time, Nadir Shah's

400
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,360
trusted guard General Ahmed Shah Durrani goes to

401
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,680
Afghanistan with Kohinoor

402
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,920
and starts his own Durrani Empire there

403
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,399
and in this way Kohinoor

404
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,720
becomes a part of the Afghan Royal Family

405
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,680
and then year after year it is passed on in the family

406
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,079
and in the year 1803, Kohinoor

407
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,079
comes to Shah Shuja Durrani and

408
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,240
as soon as Kohinoor came, bad times started for him too.

409
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,320
His cousins ​​rebel.   Due to

410
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,120
fear of which, he first gives Kohinoor to his wife

411
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,279
Wafa Begum and his brother Zaman Shah

412
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,720
and sends them towards Punjab under the protection of Maharaja Ranjit

413
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,959
Singh.

414
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,279
And as soon as he sends his wife and brother

415
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,680
here, the military commander of Shah Shuja

416
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,800
arrests him.  Now as soon as this

417
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,800
happens, Shah Shuja's wife Wafa Begum

418
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,720
goes to Maharaja Ranjit Singh.  She

419
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,959
asks him for help and tells him to

420
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
save her husband Shah Shuja.  In return,

421
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,880
I will give you the most precious thing in the world,

422
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,120
Kohinoor.  And this was the time when Maharaja

423
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,959
Ranjit Singh had asked him

424
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,800
what is so special about Kohinoor that it is so valuable

425
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,199
?  So Wafa Begum says at that time that

426
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,920
if five strong wrestlers

427
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,079
throw stones in all four directions and towards the sky, then the

428
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,880
distance covered by it if

429
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,560
filled with gold, even then it will still be

430
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
more than the value of Kohinoor.  And then

431
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,639
after this the deal is fixed that the most

432
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,519
precious Kohinoor will be given to Maharaja Ranjit Singh

433
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,920
and in return he will get Shah

434
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,320
Shuja released and bring him back.

435
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,800
And one more thing was fixed in exchange for Kohinoor

436
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,759
that Maharaja Ranjit Singh will give Rs. 3

437
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,920
lakh and 50 horses in exchange for it.  Now as soon as the

438
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,480
deal is done, Maharaja Ranjit Singh

439
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,399
uses his forces to rescue Shah Shuja

440
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,880
very quickly and bring him back.  Now the

441
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,799
deal was that after Shah Shuja returned,

442
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,559
Kohinoor was to be returned to him and his wife.

443
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,480
But both of them start showing reluctance.

444
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,400
But after multiple discussions, when Maharaja

445
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,039
Ranjit Singh put pressure on him and got the

446
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,160
house terraced, then Shah Shuja

447
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,240
officially

448
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,319
gave the Kohinoor Diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh around October 1813.

449
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,799
And Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji was

450
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,640
very happy after getting the possession of Kohinoor.

451
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,280
He liked Kohinoor very much.  So daily

452
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,799
whenever he went out, he used to tie this on his forehead.

453
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,880
But after this

454
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,360
he kept it in the royal treasury

455
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,280
and then wore it only on special occasions.

456
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,280
And

457
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
two more diamonds were placed next to this Kohinoor diamond.  This is his image.

458
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,600
Now after this, by the year 1830, the

459
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,360
influence of the British became very

460
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
strong in India.  And the

461
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
talk about the Sikh umpire's treasure and Kohinoor was spread

462
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,400
far and wide.  And the British also had their eyes on this treasure.  The

463
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,400

464
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,200
British had heard so much about Kohinoor that

465
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,919
in the same year 1830, British officer

466
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,600
W.G. Osborne himself went to the umpire’s court and

467
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,120
requested Maharaja Ranjit Singh to see Kohinoor once because he had

468
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880

469
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
heard so much about it.  Once you show it,

470
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
it gets shown as well.

471
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,799
He has also written about this incident in his book

472
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,640
Court and Camp of Ranjit Singh.

473
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,039
And this was the time when the British

474
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,200

475
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,440
wanted to gain control over the Sikh Empire and its treasury at any cost.  But

476
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,640
at that time the Sikh umpire was very strong.

477
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,960
Now what happens in the meantime is that the year 1838

478
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,799
starts and Maharaja Ranjit Singh's

479
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,880
health starts deteriorating.  And

480
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,360
this was the time when Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji had

481
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,000
started making huge donations.  He

482
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,679
also asked to donate Kohinoor to the Jagannath Temple.

483
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,400
All these

484
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,080
things are mentioned in the Sikh Court of Official Record Ummad

485
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,840
ul Tawarikh.

486
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,160
So the donations were going on but

487
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,880
when it came to the donation of Kohinoor,

488
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,480
Beliram, the treasurer of Raja Ranjit Singh, got

489
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,400
upset and

490
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,240
refused to donate it saying that it was such a precious

491
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,919
diamond.  It is the property of the Sikh umpire.

492
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,520
This is not personal property.  Therefore it

493
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,640
should not be donated.  But then

494
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,640
amidst all this,

495
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,120
Maharaja Ranjit Singh died on 27th June 1839.

496
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,799
Then after this his son Kharak Singh

497
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,400
takes over the throne.  But Kohinoor is

498
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,559
not donated.  But as soon as

499
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,880
he becomes king and gets possession of Kohinoor

500
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,000
, someone gives him slow poison.

501
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,000
He also died on the fifth of November 1840.

502
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Then Raja Naunihal Singh

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,960
takes over the throne.  They also get Kohinoor.  At the

504
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,280
same time, the Hazaribagh gate also falls on them.

505
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,280
They too die.

506
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,080
Then Kohinoor comes to Sher Singh.  He

507
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,840
too was executed on 15th of September 1843.

508
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,520
So in every house, people

509
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,600
started talking about the fact that this

510
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Kohinoor is cursed.  Maharaja Ranjit

511
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200
Singh ji had rightly said that it should be

512
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,760
donated to the temple.  And this whole

513
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,679
story of Kohinoor was

514
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,840
published in the daily newspapers and everyone in England also

515
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,160
read it.  Kohinoor had become

516
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,840
very famous in England also.  The Queen

517
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,679
also became very interested

518
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,320
in Kohinoor.  So after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the

519
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,640
Sikh umpires

520
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,480
started dying one after the other.  There was a leadership crisis and the

521
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,120
Sikh umpire became very weak.

522
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,120
Apart from his 5 year old son Dilip Singh, no

523
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,480
one else was left.  And then, out of

524
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,640
compulsion, 5 year old Dilip

525
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,120
Singh was made the king in the year 1843.  And his mother

526
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,280
Jind Kaur used to take care of all these things.

527
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,520
And the British found this to be the best time to

528
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,559
exert their control over the Sikh umpire.

529
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,120
And then on 11th of December 1845, the British

530
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,720
attacked the Sikh umpire and

531
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,640
took control of him.  And Maharaja Dilip

532
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
Singh's mother was put under

533
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
house arrest inside the fort and

534
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,600
he took all the political power in his hands.

535
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
And what do the British do after this?   He gets the

536
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,679
seven year old Maharaja Dilip Singh to

537
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,360
sign the Treaty of Lahore.  It

538
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,799
is signed twice.  I will tell you at once.  There were

539
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,799
many things in this treaty.

540
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,520
But through this treaty,

541
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,280
Kohinoor was officially

542
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,280
taken under the control of the British.

543
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,880
These things were written about Kohinoor in Article 3 of this treaty.

544
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,799
You please pause it and see once.

545
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,520
And because of the Treaty of Lahore,

546
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,880
Kohinoor was now officially

547
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,799
taken under the control of the British.  And

548
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,799
because there have been

549
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
huge battles over the control of the ownership of Kohinoor.

550
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,640
So on paper he

551
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,600
took it with him.  Along with this,

552
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,159
a ceremony was also organised on the 7th of December 1849

553
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,240
in which Kohinoor was handed over to the British in front of everyone.

554
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,039
And then after this, it was

555
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,039

556
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,679
planned to reserve Kohinoor for the Queen and gift it to her and it was announced

557
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,919
that now the rightful owner of Kohinoor will

558
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,559
be the Queen.  Now after this the next

559
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,960
task was to take Kohinoor to England to the

560
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,960
Queen.  But before that it was decided

561
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,280
that

562
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,600
Kohinoor would be gifted to the Queen to impress her.  So if we

563
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,840

564
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,000
tell her the interesting story behind this, she will be very impressed.

565
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,640
And for this task, Governor General

566
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,280
Dalhousie called Assistant Magistrate

567
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,120
Theo Matt Calfe and gave him the task to

568
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,120

569
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
find out about the history of Kohinoor and its factual

570
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,799
history as quickly as possible and submit a report and there

571
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,720

572
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,320
should not be anything wrong in it and in a very short time Matcafe collected details

573
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,799
about Kohinoor, from where it was

574
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,039
mined, what was its location,

575
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,360
how it came to Nadir Shah and the

576
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,039
story that was going around about its bad luck and misfortune, and

577
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,039

578
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,880
submitted a report,

579
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,559
but this was a story of miss, misfortune and bad luck.

580
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,080
All these things were

581
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,080
also being published in the newspapers of England.  So the

582
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,600
people of England were also very excited

583
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,679
that the Kohinoor was going to

584
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,440
come to our country in some time.  Now after this the

585
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,679
next task was to take Kohinoor from India to

586
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,320
England.  So firstly Kohinoor was

587
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,720
safely brought from Lahore Fort to Mumbai on the second of February 1850.

588
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,440
And then on the

589
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,760
sixth of April 1850, Captain Lockyer

590
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440

591
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
took it in the British Royal Navy ship HMS Media and took it towards England.

592
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,679
Now Kohinoor is in the ship.  So that no

593
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,159
one gets suspicious about it, Kohinoor is

594
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,000
kept in a normal box and a lock is put on it

595
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,799
which has two keys

596
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,720
and one key is shared by Ramsay and the other by the Captain.

597
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,480
Now after this the

598
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
ship leaves for England

599
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,159
but after some time cholera spreads in the ship.

600
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,000
When the captain goes down to the bottom of the ship,

601
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,600
he finds two crew members

602
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,840
dead because of illness.  So

603
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
these people make some arrangements and

604
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,360
stay in Mauritius.  Treatment etc. is

605
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,280
done there.  But after leaving from there,

606
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,520
when we go a little further, we

607
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,600
also get stuck in a storm etc.  And then somehow, after facing

608
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,559
all the difficulties, it reaches

609
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,960
Poss Smooth Port of England on the second of July 1850.

610
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,960
 

611
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,000
And here in London, there was eager waiting.  There was

612
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,440
only talk about Kohinoor everywhere.  The

613
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,420
newspapers were

614
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,600
filled with details of Kohinoor only.

615
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,520
[MUSIC]

616
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,840
She's so excited.  Now what happens is

617
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,919
that on one side the Kohinoor had

618
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,240
just reached England.  On the other hand, the

619
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,919
Prime Minister of England, Robert Peel, was

620
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520

621
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,679
going towards Constitution Hill on a horse.  Suddenly the horse throws him down and

622
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,080
crushes him, and he dies exactly on the same day on which

623
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,080
Kohinoor reaches England.

624
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,000
Now, on one hand, the PM has died.  On the

625
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
other hand, Queen Victoria

626
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,200
leaves Cambridge House and goes to the

627
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,200

628
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,960
house of her uncle Prince Adolphus who had died. All of a sudden,

629
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,799

630
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,039
a man named Robert Francis takes out an iron rod and

631
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,600
attacks Queen Victoria.

632
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,679
All this news was being published simultaneously in the news.  On one

633
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,360
side there was Kohinoor and on the other side all the

634
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,600
incidents that were happening were being published.  So people

635
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,520
started associating Kohinoor with black magic and thought that

636
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,080
bringing it might be a mistake.  Now on the

637
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,400
next day, i.e., third of July 1850, the

638
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,400
Queen had to receive Kohinoor.

639
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,559
John, who was the President of the Board of Control, had to

640
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,200
hand over Kohinoor to the Queen.

641
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,919
And when the Queen was receiving the world's most famous and precious

642
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,080
diamond, one of her eyes was black

643
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,159
and she had an injury on her forehead.  Now Kohinoor had

644
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,400
reached the Queen.  The Queen

645
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
finds the shape of Kohinoor a bit bad.

646
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,880
So at that time David Brewster was

647
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,559

648
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
also known as the Father of Modern Experimental Optics.  She gives the

649
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960
task of correcting Konur's shape to them.

650
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,679
And in return David

651
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,720
Brewster took 8000 British pounds.  And by

652
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,559
correcting the shape and cutting of Kohinoor, it was

653
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,400
made more beautiful.  But

654
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,159
in the process of doing this its weight reduced again.

655
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,120
Now only 105.6 carats

656
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,279
i.e. 21.12 grams of Kohinoor was left.  Now this

657
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,240
thing had happened but after some time

658
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,480
in the year 1861 when Queen Victoria's husband

659
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,640
Prince Albert also dies then the

660
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,960
story starts again that

661
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,120
only a female can save herself from this.

662
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,039
Otherwise, if there is any male then it will bring a lot of bad luck for him.

663
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,520
So this was the time when

664
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,679
Kohinoor was put into the Queen's crown

665
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,760
so that it would remain exclusive only to the

666
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,610
female members of the British Royal Family.

667
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,480

668
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:24,480
 

669
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,480
And if there is any male member of the Royal Family then

670
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,159
he/she cannot wear Kohinoor.  In fact,

671
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,240
even today, only females wear it

672
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,120
in the royal family.  Now see, after this,

673
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,880
in the year 1947 when our country became independent and the

674
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,320
time came for the British to leave,

675
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,320
our government gave a formal

676
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
request that Kohinoor should be returned

677
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,600
to India, but the British

678
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,080
completely refused at that time.

679
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,320
Then there was no discussion about Kohinoor for a long time.

680
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,799
But then

681
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,360
what happens in the year 1953 is that the

682
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,360
coronation of Queen Elizabeth takes place.  At that time,

683
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,960
India once again

684
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,880
makes a request to take back Kohinoor.  But again the

685
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,039
request is rejected.

686
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,200
Till now, all the

687
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,960
requests for taking back Kohinoor were being made by India through formal discussions and

688
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,799
letters.

689
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,760
No court case was filed.  Now when all these

690
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,760
things were happening, in the year 1976,

691
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,520
Pakistan also jumped into it after seeing India.

692
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,279
Pakistan says that Kohinoor

693
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,200
is the heritage of Lahore.  Lahore was the

694
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,799
capital of the Sikh Empire at that time and it was through the Treaty of

695
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,960
Lahore that you people took Coonoor.

696
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,039
So give it back to us.  Now seeing this, the

697
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,799
Taliban also jumped into it.

698
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,640
He says that Kohinoor has also been a part of the Durani Empire.

699
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,400
So we

700
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
should get it back.  We have a right to it.  By doing this,

701
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
Iran also says that we should meet.

702
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,400
Now after seeing all these things the British

703
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,000
refused to allow it to all the countries.  He

704
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,400
rejects everyone's request.

705
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,720
He simply says one thing that Kohinoor has legally gone to

706
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,120
Britain.  Therefore, you have

707
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,520
no right over it.  Now after this, for a long time there was

708
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,799

709
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,720
no discussion about Kohinoor in India.  And then comes the year

710
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:50,559
1997.  At this time Kuldeep Nair, who was

711
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,200
also a journalist earlier, became an MP

712
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,960
in the Rajya Sabha.  And a year after becoming an MP, that is

713
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,120
in the year 1998, he gathered 50 more

714
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,600
MPs with him and got them to

715
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,159
sign a petition and again appealed to the British Government

716
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,480
that Kohinoor is a

717
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,240
symbol of colonial plunder.  It

718
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,080
should be returned to India as soon as possible.  And

719
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,159
these were the 50 MPs who had signed this petition.

720
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,840
Dr. Manmohan Singh was also present in this.

721
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,840
He also signed this

722
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,159
petition.  There is a lot of noise about

723
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,000
bringing back Kohinoor.  A lot of news is also made.

724
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,559

725
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,799
Looking at the public sentiments, the then external foreign minister Jaswant Singh had

726
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,480
said that Kohinoor would be brought back.

727
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,000
But the matter stops right there.  Then

728
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,000
after this comes the year 2002.  At this time

729
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Queen Elizabeth's helper dies.

730
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:41,840
And a crown containing Kohinoor was placed on his coffin.

731
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,520
Now

732
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,520
all these things were being telecast live within India

733
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,400
as well.  And seeing these things the

734
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,159
common people of India start saying again.

735
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,080
Again she demands that Kohinoor

736
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,760
should be returned.  The Sikh community in India

737
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,919
also got very angry that

738
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,640
Kohinoor had been the legacy of the Sikh umpire for a long time.

739
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,200
It should somehow be brought back and

740
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,720
installed in the Amritsar temple.

741
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,559
At the same time, the officials of Jagannath Puri Temple

742
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,240
also

743
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,720
demanded that Kohinoor be brought back at any cost.

744
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,039
Maharaja Ranjit Singh's wish was

745
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,720
that Kohinoor should go to Jagannath Puri Temple.

746
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,720
And at this time,

747
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,799
these things were getting published in the newspapers almost every day and back

748
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,720
to back PILs were being filed in the courts so that the

749
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,399
Indian Government could somehow

750
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,240
put pressure on the British Government and get

751
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,240
Kohinoor back.  India has a right on this.

752
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,360
This is a part of India's heritage.  Out of

753
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,679
all the PILs, one

754
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,919
PIL was filed in 2016 by All India Human Rights and

755
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,760
Social Justice Front NGO.  He had

756
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
filed a PIL and requested the

757
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,520
government to take some steps.   The

758
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,600
case went on in the court for several days and on

759
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,480
behalf of the government, Solicitor General

760
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,440
Ranjit Kumar said that Kohinoor was neither

761
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,600
stolen nor did the British take it away forcibly.

762
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,000
This was given of his own free will.

763
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,240
So we cannot make such claims and if we

764
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,080
make such claims then tomorrow some

765
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
other country will take some thing or the other from us and

766
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,000
claim it.  Now as soon as this news

767
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,399
comes out, people's sentiments

768
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,480
start turning against the government.  The news starts getting made

769
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,320
and when the matter gets out of hand, then the

770
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,559
government reverses its stand

771
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,559
and says that India

772
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,919
belongs only to Kohinoor.  But there are difficulties in bringing it legally.

773
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,520
Challenges are still coming.

774
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,200
But we will take whatever steps are necessary to get it back.

775
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,360
And

776
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,440
actually, there were legal hurdles in bringing Konur back.  The

777
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,320
Antiquities and

778
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,399
Art Treasures Act of 1972 allows the government to

779
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,720

780
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,480
claim ownership of its valuable historical art.

781
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,039
But there was a problem in this as

782
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,279
it was applicable only for items manufactured after the year 1972.

783
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,039
India could not legally use it to

784
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,360
bring back Kohinoor.

785
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,000
And secondly, both India and

786
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,720
Britain have signed the UNESCO Convention

787
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,880
and its Article Seven allows that

788
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,679
a country can take back

789
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,679
its cultural items or treasures by taking legal action against another country.

790
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,399
But there was the same problem in this as well that

791
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,320

792
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,240
both the countries had signed this convention for the items issued after the year 1970.

793
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,320
So the matter got stuck here as well.

794
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,320
And

795
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,120
as per Article 1 of the convention which was signed by both the countries, there was

796
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,919
also a rule that if there is any item of cultural heritage, then

797
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,480
it will be seen

798
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,799
from which country that item originally came.

799
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Like where did you find it for the first time or what is the proof of

800
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,720
that thing.  But here also the problem

801
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,640
arises that with time,

802
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,960
everything including the country's state has changed.  First there

803
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,679
was only India, then Pakistan was also formed.

804
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,480
Apart from that, Kohinoor has

805
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,960
travelled to every area from India to Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan

806
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,880
and was colonised by the British at that time.

807
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,360
So actually there is a conflict as to

808
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,360
which country it will be considered as at that time from where it originated.

809
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,440

810
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,679
But even after that the common people of India did

811
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,000
not stop.  Many PILs keep

812
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,559
going to Indian courts back to back year after year.

813
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,720
And then, fed up, the Supreme Court

814
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,480
dismissed the PIL and gave a statement that

815
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,480
we cannot get Kohinoor back by passing an order for a foreign country.

816
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,559
So

817
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,279
this problem arose here as well.  But even after all these things, the

818
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,120
pressure from the general public is so much

819
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,440
that the government has to give statements from time to time and

820
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,279
fight a legal battle

821
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,440
with the British government to bring back Kohinoor.

822
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,440
And it has happened many times that India has

823
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,360
put forward its arguments very strongly.

824
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,880
In which India says that the Kohinoor which was

825
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,799
given to the British was

826
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,440
not given willingly.  At that time Dilip Singh was very

827
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,840
young and the British put his mother under

828
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,399
house arrest and became the guardian themselves and

829
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,799
got the Kohinoor legally signed.  And

830
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,320
India repeatedly says that Kohinoor

831
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,960

832
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,720
is not just a diamond for India but it is a cultural heritage.  This is

833
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,640
an artifact for India which

834
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,320
represents the culture of India.

835
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
And India also says that no matter

836
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,039
how much the British say that they have a legal

837
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,200
right over it, the actual fact is that the

838
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,520
British colonized India and

839
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,679
misused their power to take Kohinoor to their

840
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,600
country.  In fact, the

841
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,360
proof of Archaeological Survey also clearly states that

842
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,279
Kohinoor originated in India,

843
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,279
within the Golconda region.

844
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,840
[Music]

845
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,159
And at the same time, the Indian

846
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,919
rulers have had the ownership of Kohinoor for the longest time.

847
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
But the British

848
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,320
have only one argument on all these things, that

849
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,720

850
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,360
we have acquired Kohinoor legally through the Treaty of Lahore.

851
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,000
This thing is clearly mentioned in Article 3 and for the last 150 years

852
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,480
Kohinoor has been a part of the Crown.

853
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,320
And if we give away Kohinoor like this, then all the

854
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,320
museums of the world, including the

855
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,559
museum in England, will become empty.  Because in

856
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,159
this way some country or the other will claim the artifact

857
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,399
in some other country's museum and

858
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,919
demand it back.

859
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,519
And

860
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,159
one thing I told you earlier was that the British had organised a

861
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,159
small ceremony.  After that he

862
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,080
took Kohinoor.  British officials also give reference to it.

863
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,000
And along with this the

864
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,960
British say that even if we give it, then to

865
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,760
whom should we give it?  Iran, Afghanistan,

866
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,360
Pakistan, India, so many countries are claiming

867
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,080
Koinoor.  Everyone is saying that

868
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,240
Koinoor is our heritage.  So who has the real ownership

869
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,320
?  This too is not easy to find out.

870
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,880
So these are all the problems due to which

871
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,519
Kohinoor could not be brought back.  But the demand of the general public

872
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,000
even today is that Kohinoor

873
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,000
is a part of India's heritage and the

874
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,919
government should bring it back somehow.

875
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,399
And along with this, its

876
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,559
superstition due to misfortune is

877
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,559
still talked about by people.  Still you will

878
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,519
find multiple writers who talk about its curses.

879
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,240
When Queen Elizabeth died on 8th of September 2022

880
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:12,399
and

881
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,399
after that King Charles, who was

882
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,480
a male, became the king.  So after that, in 204,

883
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,559
he was diagnosed with cancer.  So again the

884
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,720
stories about the curse of Kohinoor and black magic

885
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,799
started because even though the king did

886
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,279
not keep Kohinoor with himself but

887
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,360
after the death of Elizabeth technically the

888
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,080
ownership of Kohinoor had come to him.  One had

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,399
come by mail.  That is why all this happened and

890
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,200
people always give the example that

891
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,679
before Kohinoor came to England,

892
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,240
Asia, Africa,

893
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,159
Europe, America, Australia all came under the British Empire.

894
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,240
People used to say that the

895
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,080
sun never sets in the British Empire.  But if you look at today's date,

896
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,720
Britain has become a small

897
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,640
island nation and there are still multiple

898
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,799
writers who write that this has

899
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,399
happened because of the curse of Conur.  Now look,

900
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,120
in the end let me tell you once again that

901
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,279
you can simplify your accounting

902
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,510
with Udu Accounting App for free.  I have

903
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:24,699
