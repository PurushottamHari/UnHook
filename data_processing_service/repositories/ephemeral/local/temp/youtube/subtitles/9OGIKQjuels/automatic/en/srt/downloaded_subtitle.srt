1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,520
Hello Friends.  Friends, recently

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,079
during Operation Sindoor you must have seen that India's

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,320
air superiority has become

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,559
known to the world to a large extent, meaning that if any

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
drone or missile comes towards India,

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,960
we are capable of stopping it.  But what

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,760
happened recently is that a shocking statement came

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
from S Somnath, the former chairman of ISRO, in

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,440
which it was told

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,920
that India currently does

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,000

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,039
not have the capability to stop the hypersonic missiles.  Or you can see the

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,960
news, Ex ISRO Chief Says Hypersonic

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
Missiles Extremely Difficult to

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
Intercept, India Needs 100s of Satellites,

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,439
so let's understand it in a little detail,

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,360
what exactly he wanted to say, what are these

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,360
hypersonic missiles,

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
why are they so difficult, what can India do,

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
what things can it launch,

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,799
I will tell you all that in detail,

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,799
let's move ahead, but before that

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
friends, let me tell you all that

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,200
Great Learning Festival is going on at Study IQ right now

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,680

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
closing, the

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Foundation Batch has been launched for Pratigya 2026,

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,119

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
everything.  So to

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,960
get extra discount you have to use

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
this code Ankit Live so that you

can get maximum discount and its link is

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
given in the comment section.  Let's get

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,280
started.  See,

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,920
today the aerial and cyber fronts are

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,479
reshaping modern combat and in

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,439
a way, the

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,000
space for national defence is emerging as a decisive domain.  It

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,000
means that the

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,799
equipment that we have on earth is used,

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,960
but the entire space area above the earth, with

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,040
satellites etc.,

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,439
its role has become very important and in

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,759
view of this, the former ISRO chief

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,959
S Somnath has warned that

58
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,920
without a massive satellite boost, India will have to

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,040
launch satellites on a large scale

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,160
so that the Indian armed forces do

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,480
not face a crisis.  At a time when

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,560
development of hypersonic missiles is taking place all over the

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,599
world.  Because this is such a

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,760
vulnerability which can create a huge problem for us.

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, the first

66
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,840
question that comes here is,

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,080
what is the meaning of hypersonic missiles?  The

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,599
simple thing is that these are those missiles

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,640
whose speed is greater than five Mach.

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,599
Meaning of Mach 5 means that

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,720

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,640
whatever speed you have which is five times the speed of sound, we call it hypersonic.

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,640
So the missiles that travel like this,

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,640
you can understand that the missiles that travel at a speed of more than 6100 km/h are

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,879

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,120

77
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,760
called hypersonic missiles.  Well, there are basically two types.

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
Your Hypersonic

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,360
Glide Vehicle is complete.  If you understand carefully

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
then see what happens,

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
you must have heard about intercontinental ballistic missiles.  So

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,440
what ballistic missiles usually do is they are

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,760
launched into your atmosphere.  It

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,400
goes very high and

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,879
with the help of gravity, reaches a particular point and

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,599
hits the target.  So what

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,159
happens is that in most cases the

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,319
path of ballistic missiles is predictable.

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,560
You can predict it in advance

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,959
with your radar system or whatever

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
mechanism you have and then you

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,120
can destroy it in the air.  So it

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,440
becomes a little bit easier.  But

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,000
if you look at hypersonic missiles,

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,319
it is launched from a rocket

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
in the atmosphere and after launch,

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,799
on reaching a particular height, you can see that

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,920
it works like a glide vehicle.

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,959
Meaning, it glides and you will not be able to predict its

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,040
particular treasury in a way.  It becomes

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,480

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920
a bit difficult for the radar systems etc. on the ground because these move at a

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,080
very high speed and they

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,239
hit particular targets while gliding.

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,239
So one is hypersonic

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,879
glide vehicle and the other is

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,799
hypersonic cruise missile.  Now

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,799
you all must be aware that cruise missile is something like this.

111
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,759
Meaning, it goes a little above the ground

112
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,080
and in this way

113
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,720
it moves parallel to the ground.  So what is hypersonic is that the

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,360
hypersonic cruise missiles fly

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,080
very close to the ground, just a

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,639
little above the ground, again, you are

117
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,880
cruising here and again, if you see,

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,800
you can easily change its direction as well.

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,800
Meaning, its speed is very fast.

120
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,479
Plus you can

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,400
also change its direction and it

122
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
hits a particular target.  So, it is

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,639
most difficult to identify this.

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,880
So how will you

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,040
detect it?  So these become dangerous because the first thing is that

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
here

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,440
you get very little time to

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,240
detect them.  Because their speed is

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,840
very fast.  The second is they are highly

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
maneuverable.   What this

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,000
means is that its directions can be changed even in mid-flight.

132
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
Unlike ballistic missile.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,639
Your ballistic missile

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,120
follows a particular path and the third thing is

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,160
your low radar cross section.  Meaning that it

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,560
moves so close to the ground that

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,960
ground based radars are

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,960
unable to identify it.  Apart from this,

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,360
what is plasma shield is that it happens at such a high speed that

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,520
if you look around it,

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,160
plasma gets created.  Which

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,479
again makes it an invisible weapon.

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
Meaning it is very difficult to identify it again.

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,800
So keeping this in mind,

146
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,720
S Somnath ji has said that hypersonic

147
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,440
missiles are extremely difficult to

148
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,919
intercept.  And if India wants to monitor this and

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,560
counter it, then India

150
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,120
needs 100s of satellites specially for

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
surveillance and early warning.  So in a

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,680
way, this should become our national priority

153
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,560
because at present there are many such countries, be it

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,440
China or Russia.  They are having

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,600
advanced hypersonic capability.  He

156
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,160
already has a capability.  India does

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
not have it.  So if I tell you about India's current space based

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
surveillance capability,

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,120
then if you look at it, currently India has

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,080
50 to 60 active satellites

161
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,400
which have the capability of surveillance and reconnaissance.

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
So what I

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,560
mean to say is that if you look at India's military

164
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,880
satellites, you will basically find the Reset series in it.

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,039

166
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Carto set series with radar imaging will be available.

167
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,639
GSAT 7A with optical imaging and GSAT 7R which are

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,600
used for defence communications.  So they are

169
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,759
largely focused on border monitoring,

170
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,400
communication and disaster management.  This

171
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,280
means that we do not yet have the capability to

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,520

173
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,680
track hypersonic threats in real time.  We

174
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
can identify and track it and

175
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,400
destroy it in the air.  So

176
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,800
what is the limitations here is that we do not have enough

177
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,280
satellites to cover the entire Indian

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,199
airspace.  Even now see that India

179
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,199
's ISRO is doing good work.

180
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,599
We launch satellites continuously from time to time.

181
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,560
But still they are not enough.  Because

182
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,280
we

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,039
cannot cover the entire Indian airspace in real time with the satellites we have right now.

184
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
And

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,880
what happens with most satellites is that their revisit

186
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,120
times are limited.  That means, suppose

187
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,680
this is Earth and the satellite is passing through a place.

188
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,319
So

189
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
when will the satellite pass through the same particular space for the second time?  So the

190
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,720
revisit time is quite limited for

191
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,440
most of the satellites.  Because of which

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,680
we are not able to monitor the same location continuously.

193
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,080
Then we don't have any

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,400
dedicated hypersonic tracking sensors

195
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,039
which the US and China already have.  In

196
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,280
fact, if you talk about other countries,

197
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,319
for example America.  So they are

198
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,120
already building a tracking layer in low

199
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,759
Earth orbit.

200
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,000
This is being done within their space department agency, SDA,

201
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,080
and infrared sensor

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,879
constellations are being built by them.  Such as

203
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,520
Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space

204
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,720
Sensors Next Generation Overhead President

205
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,639
Infrared Satellites.  So what will he do?

206
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,360

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,360
It will detect the heat signatures of hypersonic missiles.  So,

208
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,440
you might have recently heard that Donald

209
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Trump has launched a very big project called

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,759
Golden Dome.  Ok?  So that the entire

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,080
American airspace

212
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,160
can be protected for America.  So all this is happening in that too

213
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,639
under this.  Secondly, if we

214
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,720
talk about China, they had

215
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,879
tested the DF7 Hypersonic Glide Vehicle.

216
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
And what they are doing is that they are creating a whole

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
constellation of

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
early warning satellites

219
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
under their military space program so that

220
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,519
if any hypersonic missile is launched on their country,

221
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,279
they will be

222
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,599
able to detect it in advance.  In the same way,

223
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,680
if you observe, Russia is also trying to work in a similar way.

224
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,320
But the one that is

225
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,880
ahead of all these is your

226
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,200
America.  So the question arises that

227
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,519
why does India need 100s of satellites at this time

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,240
?  The first thing is the need for

229
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,800
continuous coverage over India and adversary

230
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
territories.  Because

231
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,640
right now we are not able to cover our entire space.

232
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
So first of all, we need to cover that.

233
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Then the second one is infrared

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,080
satellite.  This means that

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,480
we can watch the trail of the heat generated by missiles from space itself.

236
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,640
Meaning, here, if there is any attack on India, then

237
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,040
our satellite from space itself will

238
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,320
track it that this

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,480
hypersonic missile of yours is going to

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,560
hit India.  Apart from this,

241
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,959
what I told you about the revisit capability, not

242
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,920
when a satellite is revisiting a particular point.

243
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,160
So

244
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,519
we need to increase its capability further.  And

245
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,480
along with this, AI sense has increased a lot in today's modern world.

246
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,120
So we have to integrate that particular satellite with AI

247
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,519

248
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,839
so that if any satellite here

249
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,399
detects any hypersonic missile,

250
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,959
then it can process it quickly.   We

251
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
can automatically detect threats and

252
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,519
make decisions about when and how to

253
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
eliminate them.  So basically

254
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,760
if you see here, there is a role of many satellites.

255
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,839
For example,

256
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,560
if we talk about Infrared Earth Observation Satellites, then

257
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,680
it basically detects the missile which is launched

258
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,440
via heat signature.

259
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,200
So that is why we should

260
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,880
launch infrared satellites.

261
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,959
Apart from this, radar imaging

262
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,440
satellites will also be needed so that

263
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,760
we

264
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
can track the movement of missiles day and night and in all weathers;

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,000
and apart from this, relay and communication

266
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,320
satellites.  So basically what it does is that

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,720
it connects to the early warning system

268
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,519
and intercepts that yes, in

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,760

270
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,079
a way, in which direction is this hypersonic missile going.

271
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,160
Meaning, how are we able to intercept it

272
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,640
and apart from this, navigation satellite

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,200
means that we will be

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,720
able to know exactly through interception of the incoming threat and where

275
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,760
it is going to hit.  So there will be

276
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,320
different such satellites which is a

277
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,240
huge need for India at this time.  And the question

278
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,320
here is what India needs to do

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,800
now?  What should be done now?  The first

280
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,440
thing is that we should create a hypersonic defence programme

281
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,680
under DRDO and

282
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,959
Defence Space Agency.  Then the second thing is

283
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,279
that we will have to launch at least 100 to 200 low Earth

284
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,720
orbit satellites

285
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,880
with hypersonic tracking sensors on an urgent basis.

286
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Then thirdly, we have to

287
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
partner with private players.

288
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,040
For example Pixel Sky Road,

289
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,680
in India you will see Agnikul Dhruv Space

290
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,399
so that their deployment can be done very quickly and at a fast

291
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,120
speed.  We

292
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,680
cannot depend solely on ISRO's launches.

293
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,760
Apart from this,

294
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,240
we will have to integrate AI based analytics.  And

295
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,079
lastly, there will have to be coordination between ISRO and DRDO, the

296
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,640
Defence Space Agency,

297
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,279
so that

298
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,040
India can develop a joint war fighting doctrine.  So it becomes

299
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,480
very important for India to do this at this time.

300
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
And ultimately

301
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,880
what is its implication, i.e. conclusion

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
?  Look, the threat of missile capability from India's two neighbouring countries,

303
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,600
China and Pakistan, is

304
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,720
continuously increasing.

305
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,320
China has tested DF 17.

306
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,320
This is a big challenge for India

307
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
and it is obvious that you all know

308
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,120
that ultimately this technology will be passed on

309
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,880
to Pakistan.  So

310
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,360
we will be threatened by both the countries and

311
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,959
right now, the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence does

312
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,839
not have the capability to deal with the

313
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,480
hypersonic threat.  Therefore, space based

314
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,040
early warning is going to be the best bet for India.

315
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,880
Meaning because ISRO is

316
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,279
already doing good work.  So the

317
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,200
best way for India at this time is to

318
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,519

319
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,839
launch a lot of satellites into space so that

320
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,600
we are ready tomorrow with such hypersonic

321
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,200
thread.  So this was the whole video friends.

322
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,720
I hope you have understood it in detail

323
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,399
and before leaving, can you tell me a very

324
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,160
interesting question?

327
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,160
you have to tell which of the two statements is

328
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
correct and the right answer to this, as you all
