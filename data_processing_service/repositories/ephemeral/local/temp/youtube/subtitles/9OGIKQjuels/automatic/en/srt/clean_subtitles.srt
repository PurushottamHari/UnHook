Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then what is the use of reading them again and again? I would like to thank Study IQ.  I Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study IQ supported me till Mains. Even after that he did not leave me. And I have taken this mock I study IQ. And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I will definitely recommend Study IQ. Hello Friends.  Friends, recently during Operation Sindoor you must have seen that India's air superiority has become known to the world to a large extent, meaning that if any drone or missile comes towards India, we are capable of stopping it.  But what happened recently is that a shocking statement came from S Somnath, the former chairman of ISRO, in which it was told that India currently does not have the capability to stop the hypersonic missiles.  Or you can see the news, Ex ISRO Chief Says Hypersonic Missiles Extremely Difficult to Intercept, India Needs 100s of Satellites, so let's understand it in a little detail, what exactly he wanted to say, what are these hypersonic missiles, why are they so difficult, what can India do, what things can it launch, I will tell you all that in detail, let's move ahead, but before that friends, let me tell you all that Great Learning Festival is going on at Study IQ right now till 15th June, when the admission of this batch will be closing, the Foundation Batch has been launched for Pratigya 2026, under which preparation is done for prelims, mains, interview, everything.  So to get extra discount you have to use this code Ankit Live so that you can get maximum discount and its link is given in the comment section.  Let's get started.  See, today the aerial and cyber fronts are reshaping modern combat and in a way, the space for national defence is emerging as a decisive domain.  It means that the equipment that we have on earth is used, but the entire space area above the earth, with satellites etc., its role has become very important and in view of this, the former ISRO chief S Somnath has warned that without a massive satellite boost, India will have to launch satellites on a large scale so that the Indian armed forces do not face a crisis.  At a time when development of hypersonic missiles is taking place all over the world.  Because this is such a vulnerability which can create a huge problem for us. Well, the first question that comes here is, what is the meaning of hypersonic missiles?  The simple thing is that these are those missiles whose speed is greater than five Mach. Meaning of Mach 5 means that whatever speed you have which is five times the speed of sound, we call it hypersonic. So the missiles that travel like this, you can understand that the missiles that travel at a speed of more than 6100 km/h are called hypersonic missiles.  Well, there are basically two types. Your Hypersonic Glide Vehicle is complete.  If you understand carefully then see what happens, you must have heard about intercontinental ballistic missiles.  So what ballistic missiles usually do is they are launched into your atmosphere.  It goes very high and with the help of gravity, reaches a particular point and hits the target.  So what happens is that in most cases the path of ballistic missiles is predictable. You can predict it in advance with your radar system or whatever mechanism you have and then you can destroy it in the air.  So it becomes a little bit easier.  But if you look at hypersonic missiles, it is launched from a rocket in the atmosphere and after launch, on reaching a particular height, you can see that it works like a glide vehicle. Meaning, it glides and you will not be able to predict its particular treasury in a way.  It becomes a bit difficult for the radar systems etc. on the ground because these move at a very high speed and they hit particular targets while gliding. So one is hypersonic glide vehicle and the other is hypersonic cruise missile.  Now you all must be aware that cruise missile is something like this. Meaning, it goes a little above the ground and in this way it moves parallel to the ground.  So what is hypersonic is that the hypersonic cruise missiles fly very close to the ground, just a little above the ground, again, you are cruising here and again, if you see, you can easily change its direction as well. Meaning, its speed is very fast. Plus you can also change its direction and it hits a particular target.  So, it is most difficult to identify this. So how will you detect it?  So these become dangerous because the first thing is that here you get very little time to detect them.  Because their speed is very fast.  The second is they are highly maneuverable.   What this means is that its directions can be changed even in mid-flight. Unlike ballistic missile. Your ballistic missile follows a particular path and the third thing is your low radar cross section.  Meaning that it moves so close to the ground that ground based radars are unable to identify it.  Apart from this, what is plasma shield is that it happens at such a high speed that if you look around it, plasma gets created.  Which again makes it an invisible weapon. Meaning it is very difficult to identify it again. So keeping this in mind, S Somnath ji has said that hypersonic missiles are extremely difficult to intercept.  And if India wants to monitor this and counter it, then India needs 100s of satellites specially for surveillance and early warning.  So in a way, this should become our national priority because at present there are many such countries, be it China or Russia.  They are having advanced hypersonic capability.  He already has a capability.  India does not have it.  So if I tell you about India's current space based surveillance capability, then if you look at it, currently India has 50 to 60 active satellites which have the capability of surveillance and reconnaissance. So what I mean to say is that if you look at India's military satellites, you will basically find the Reset series in it. Carto set series with radar imaging will be available. GSAT 7A with optical imaging and GSAT 7R which are used for defence communications.  So they are largely focused on border monitoring, communication and disaster management.  This means that we do not yet have the capability to track hypersonic threats in real time.  We can identify and track it and destroy it in the air.  So what is the limitations here is that we do not have enough satellites to cover the entire Indian airspace.  Even now see that India 's ISRO is doing good work. We launch satellites continuously from time to time. But still they are not enough.  Because we cannot cover the entire Indian airspace in real time with the satellites we have right now. And what happens with most satellites is that their revisit times are limited.  That means, suppose this is Earth and the satellite is passing through a place. So when will the satellite pass through the same particular space for the second time?  So the revisit time is quite limited for most of the satellites.  Because of which we are not able to monitor the same location continuously. Then we don't have any dedicated hypersonic tracking sensors which the US and China already have.  In fact, if you talk about other countries, for example America.  So they are already building a tracking layer in low Earth orbit. This is being done within their space department agency, SDA, and infrared sensor constellations are being built by them.  Such as Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensors Next Generation Overhead President Infrared Satellites.  So what will he do? It will detect the heat signatures of hypersonic missiles.  So, you might have recently heard that Donald Trump has launched a very big project called Golden Dome.  Ok?  So that the entire American airspace can be protected for America.  So all this is happening in that too under this.  Secondly, if we talk about China, they had tested the DF7 Hypersonic Glide Vehicle. And what they are doing is that they are creating a whole constellation of early warning satellites under their military space program so that if any hypersonic missile is launched on their country, they will be able to detect it in advance.  In the same way, if you observe, Russia is also trying to work in a similar way. But the one that is ahead of all these is your America.  So the question arises that why does India need 100s of satellites at this time ?  The first thing is the need for continuous coverage over India and adversary territories.  Because right now we are not able to cover our entire space. So first of all, we need to cover that. Then the second one is infrared satellite.  This means that we can watch the trail of the heat generated by missiles from space itself. Meaning, here, if there is any attack on India, then our satellite from space itself will track it that this hypersonic missile of yours is going to hit India.  Apart from this, what I told you about the revisit capability, not when a satellite is revisiting a particular point. So we need to increase its capability further.  And along with this, AI sense has increased a lot in today's modern world. So we have to integrate that particular satellite with AI so that if any satellite here detects any hypersonic missile, then it can process it quickly.   We can automatically detect threats and make decisions about when and how to eliminate them.  So basically if you see here, there is a role of many satellites. For example, if we talk about Infrared Earth Observation Satellites, then it basically detects the missile which is launched via heat signature. So that is why we should launch infrared satellites. Apart from this, radar imaging satellites will also be needed so that we can track the movement of missiles day and night and in all weathers; and apart from this, relay and communication satellites.  So basically what it does is that it connects to the early warning system and intercepts that yes, in a way, in which direction is this hypersonic missile going. Meaning, how are we able to intercept it and apart from this, navigation satellite means that we will be able to know exactly through interception of the incoming threat and where it is going to hit.  So there will be different such satellites which is a huge need for India at this time.  And the question here is what India needs to do now?  What should be done now?  The first thing is that we should create a hypersonic defence programme under DRDO and Defence Space Agency.  Then the second thing is that we will have to launch at least 100 to 200 low Earth orbit satellites with hypersonic tracking sensors on an urgent basis. Then thirdly, we have to partner with private players. For example Pixel Sky Road, in India you will see Agnikul Dhruv Space so that their deployment can be done very quickly and at a fast speed.  We cannot depend solely on ISRO's launches. Apart from this, we will have to integrate AI based analytics.  And lastly, there will have to be coordination between ISRO and DRDO, the Defence Space Agency, so that India can develop a joint war fighting doctrine.  So it becomes very important for India to do this at this time. And ultimately what is its implication, i.e. conclusion ?  Look, the threat of missile capability from India's two neighbouring countries, China and Pakistan, is continuously increasing. China has tested DF 17. This is a big challenge for India and it is obvious that you all know that ultimately this technology will be passed on to Pakistan.  So we will be threatened by both the countries and right now, the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence does not have the capability to deal with the hypersonic threat.  Therefore, space based early warning is going to be the best bet for India. Meaning because ISRO is already doing good work.  So the best way for India at this time is to launch a lot of satellites into space so that we are ready tomorrow with such hypersonic thread.  So this was the whole video friends. I hope you have understood it in detail and before leaving, can you tell me a very interesting question? Which of the following statements about Hypersonic Glide Vehicle is correct?
