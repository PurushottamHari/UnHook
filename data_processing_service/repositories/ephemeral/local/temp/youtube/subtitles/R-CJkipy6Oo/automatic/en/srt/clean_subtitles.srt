Hello Friends.  Friends, according to the reports that are coming out, it is being said that Iran has done such a thing that America had no clue about.  Meaning, if this is true, then the mission that has just been conducted has attacked three nuclear sites inside Iran. Maybe it will also be considered a big failure. Because the ultimate goal of America was to prevent Iran from acquiring the capability to make a nuclear bomb. But what is being said here is that 400 kg of uranium had already been removed by Iran from the site, especially the Fordo site.  You can see this news report flags unusual activity in satellite pics of Iran nuclear site.  And in this video I will tell you through satellite pics what is being said here and why this can be a big blow for America, you will get to know everything.  But before that friends, let me tell you all that from today our new batch is Pratigya Foundation Batch for UPSC 2026, you can take it and in this, preparation for everything from prelims to mains interview is done and the most important thing is that if you crack even the prelims, then the entire fee is also refunded to you.

And remember to use this code Ankit Live to get maximum discount.  Let's get started. First of all what is the context? You all know the context.  There has been a war going on between Israel and Iran for quite some time now.  Missiles were being fired continuously upon missiles. Drones were being fired.  And ultimately here America jumps into this whole war.  And you know, tomorrow morning suddenly the news comes that Donald Trump has ordered that the three nuclear sites of Iran here and which these three are, become very important. Natanz, Fardo and Ifan.  Again you can see in this map that Ishan is at the bottom here.   There is sarcasm all over him.  And above it is Fado.  And on top of this, there's this capital, Tehran. So the nuclear site at Fado is very important.  In fact, if we talk about Natansh, it is Iran's largest facility for uranium enrichment which was attacked.  So look at the Fado here, it is not the largest but it is the most important for Dodo. Because here you will find the highest quantity of newly enriched uranium. And the third one which is Ifan is basically very useful for research and conversion.  So these three have been attacked here.  And see what becomes important here?  The important thing is that America says that we carried out this attack and you know that the B-2 bombers that were specially used for FUDO have the GBU 57 bomb which penetrates very fast. Using that they crippled all three sites.  I finished it. This is what America says.  But keep in mind that some satellite pictures have emerged.  It is clear from this that yes, there has been a huge loss.  But it is important to understand how much loss might have occurred, especially in Fado. Like what I am trying to say is that if you look at this site, this is Iftikhan's nuclear technology site and here you will see clearly that there has been a heavy loss. You will clearly see the losses due to the bombing done by America.  But what I was telling you is that the most important site for Iran is for the nuclear site and it becomes important because you can see clearly that it has been built quite below this mountain here, it has been built several feet below and in this you will clearly see that here is the entrance to go below the nuclear side, to go there which is the underground complex and apart from this you will see this support building outside, there is a security check point here, which means vehicles will be coming and going from here, so this entire site is basically for two. Now what has happened is that the B2 bombers used by America yesterday and the GDU57 used here, you can see, must have caused a lot of damage because if you see the way it penetrated here, if you look carefully at the way your missile must have gone in because its job is that it does not blast first. It penetrates first.  It goes very deep below the ground and then it blasts. Even here if you see, this bomb, GBU 57, is penetrating.  He must have gone downwards and then carried out the blast there. So on the surface what we can see is that yes, a blast has taken place.  But right now you cannot say with 100% certainty how much loss might have actually occurred. Even though America is saying that yes, we have destroyed everything here.  Iran's entire nuclear program goes back many years. These things are going to speak. But exactly, we are not 100% sure right now. Now it is possible that if some things come up in tomorrow's date then we will get to know.  But amidst all these things, a very interesting thing has happened.  Many American officials and Israeli officials have pointed out that Iran may actually have already started shifting things here.  That is, things are coming out from multiple intelligence reports and it is being told that Iran has moved up to 400 kilograms of enriched uranium and the enriched uranium that we talk about is the high purity enriched uranium of 60% purity, so our main facilities and the main facility is this Fado one, a few hours before that means a few hours before the US strike or a few days before that, the entire enriched enriched uranium here must have been shifted and why am I saying this, you can see, some satellite pictures have been shared here and you can see that it has been said before the US strikes on Irshan Naataj and Fado, the satellite images of Maxar have come out, in which it was told that about 16 trucks were parked in Fado, heavy machinery was also present there on 19 and 20 June, again I will show you a little bit, this Fado site.  Isn't it okay? First, let me show you this site of Fado. If you, what did I tell you, this is the support building here and this is the security check point.  This is what I am focusing on.  You are seeing these security check points for the vehicles that come and go from here, I am showing it to you by zooming in here. If you see this, you will see a clear cut in it.  Many of these trucks etc., around 16 trucks are standing there and it is possible because it is being said here that most likely through the trucks that were standing there, the heavy machinery that was present there, it was most likely because it is obvious that Iran also knew that an attack could happen at any time.  The whole world knows that the Fado nuclear site is the most important for Iran.  So it is possible that Iran has already started shifting its enriched uranium of high porosity (60% porosity) and it is most likely being said that no one knows where it has been shifted.  It is an undisclosed location, the entire site will be fortified and it may also be stored in underground bunkers, that is, deep below the ground, and it will be present in the military control area. Most likely this is being reported and the US satellite surveillance , cyber intelligence may not have detected this thing and the inspectors of International Atomic Energy Agency were not present there for the last few days because Iran had refused, because look, Iran has also been saying repeatedly that the IAEA inspectors are sent deliberately so that things can be inspected and things can be tracked.  So but for the last few days he was not present there on the site.  So because of this it is being said that now it is possible that Iran might have taken advantage of this opportunity here and tried to shift it on an immediate basis.  Now see its analysis. See, I told you 400 kg of uranium, highly enriched uranium.  So why only 400 kg?  Because 60% enriched uranium it is only one step away from weapons grade 90% purity.  Meaning you are just one step away from making a nuclear bomb through 90% purity.  And if you have 400 kg of 60% uranium, it means you can make four to five nuclear bombs.  Do you understand what the consequence is?  So this is what we call breakout time.  Meaning, how much more time do you need to obtain weapon grade uranium. So basically it is being said that it is a time of just a few weeks.  Meaning, Iran can make whatever it wants if it wants.  Ten if Iran has this material safely hidden.  So in a way, the main objective of America's strike, its main aim, would have failed somewhere or the other. Yes, it also depends on the core element of nuclear deterrence, which means that Iran already has the knowledge now. No matter how many sites America attacks, no matter what it does. But the main knowledge is that how and in which steps can you make a nuclear weapon. So Iran also says that even if you attack our sites, how will you destroy the knowledge and wisdom that we have gained regarding this ?  So if the core element, the core element here, is 60% enriched uranium, if Iran has it, it means this could be a big failure for America and that is why many questions are being asked here that if this thing has happened now, see, things will now become crystal clear and we will know about it in the future but now many questions are being asked from America, was there a breakdown of satellite surveillance, means has there been any kind of breakdown in satellite surveillance of America which is considered to be very strong, has there been any Iranian movement, means Iran could have also done it, by showing non-nuclear logistics and showing civilians that look these trucks etc. belong to civilians, so Iran has tried to trick through that. Dude Iran uses electronic warfare to confuse America and other western countries so that whenever they are tracking here, they will not even know that uranium is passing from there. Did the US rush?  This is also the biggest question whether America hastily attacked Iran without gathering proper intelligence.  So overall it is obvious that America's main goal may be in danger.  And see what is its consequence?  The first thing is that if this is true then Iran has in a way succeeded in its objective. Secondly, now you will see that in Iran also, a propaganda type of victory or whatever you may call it, is being shown in the media there that look, the capability that Iran has is safe at this time and in a way, it will also act as a psychological deterrent because till now it was being said that its capability has been destroyed due to the US strike but now things will become uncertain here, there will always be a doubt whether Iran still has that capability, so because of this, the series of nuclear threat may still continue here and it is possible that now Iran will be able to negotiate and deal with America strongly. As far as America is concerned, even if it has carried out a strike, it will be considered a limited strategic gain.  This could be a major embarrassment to America's military success. So let's see what ultimately comes out regarding this. But this was a very important news which I wanted to tell you.  I hope you have understood well and before leaving, can you tell me a very interesting question that in natural uranium, approximately how much percentage of fissile uranium 235 is there which is used for nuclear weapons, uranium 235, so how much fissile means how much purity of uranium 235 is found in natural uranium, you all know its right answer will be found on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from Telegram and friends, as I told you, if you want to prepare for UPSC 2026, then simply you can do one thing.
