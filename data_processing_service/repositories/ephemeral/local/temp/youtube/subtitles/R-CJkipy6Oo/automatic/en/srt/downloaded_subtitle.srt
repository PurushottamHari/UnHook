00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello Friends.  Friends, according to the

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,080
reports that are coming out, it is being said

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,800
that Iran has done such a thing

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,360
that America had no clue about.  Meaning,

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,960
if this is true, then the mission that has just been

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,960
conducted has attacked three nuclear sites inside Iran.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
Maybe it will also be considered a big failure.

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,119
Because the ultimate goal of

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,760
America was to prevent Iran from acquiring the

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,000
capability to make a nuclear bomb.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,920
But what is being said here is

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,239
that 400 kg of uranium had already been

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,239
removed by Iran from the site, especially the

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,040
Fordo site.  You can see this

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,280
news report flags unusual activity

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
in satellite pics of Iran nuclear

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
site.  And in this video I will

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,879
tell you through satellite pics

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,039
what is being said here and why this

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,559
can be a big blow for America, you will

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
get to know everything.  But before that

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,640
friends, let me tell you all that from today our

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160

in this, preparation for everything from prelims to mains interview is

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,079
done and the most important thing is that if

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,920
you crack even the prelims,

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,320
then the entire fee is also refunded to you.  In

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,799
fact, if you buy the batch today then there is a

seven day refund policy here.

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,360
Yes, if you donâ€™t feel right in 7 days or

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,200
your mind changes, you

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
can take your money back.  So if you have

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
any doubt or problem then call on this phone number.

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,880
All your

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,880
doubts will be cleared here.  My personal team is

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,720
sitting here.  And remember to use this

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
code Ankit Live to get maximum

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,720
discount.  Let's get started.

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,040
First of all what is the context?

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,600
You all know the context.  There has been a

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,840
war going on between Israel and Iran for quite some time now.  Missiles were being

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,680
fired continuously upon missiles.

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
Drones were being fired.  And

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,159
ultimately here America

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,720
jumps into this whole war.  And you know,

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,960
tomorrow morning suddenly the news comes that Donald

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,880
Trump has ordered that the

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,640
three nuclear sites of Iran here and which these three are, become

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,759
very important.

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
Natanz, Fardo and Ifan.  Again you can see in this map that

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,399
Ishan is at the bottom here.   There

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,119
is sarcasm all over him.  And above it is

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,119
Fado.  And on top of this, there's this capital, Tehran.

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
So the nuclear site at Fado is

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,680
very important.  In fact, if we

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,560
talk about Natansh, it is Iran's largest

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,360
facility for uranium enrichment which was

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
attacked.  So look at the Fado here,

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
it is not the largest but it is the

62
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,760
most important for Dodo.

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,920
Because here

64
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,239
you will find the highest quantity of newly enriched uranium.

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
And the third one which is Ifan is

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,879
basically

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
very useful for research and conversion.  So these three have been

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,160
attacked here.  And see

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
what becomes important here?  The important thing is

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,440
that America says that we

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,519
carried out this attack and you know that the

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,239
B-2 bombers that were specially

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,120
used for FUDO have the GBU 57 bomb

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,440
which penetrates very fast.

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
Using that they crippled all three

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
sites.  I finished it.

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
This is what America says.  But keep in mind

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,080
that some satellite pictures have emerged.  It is

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,040
clear from this that yes, there has been a

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
huge loss.  But it is important to understand

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,800
how much loss might have occurred, especially in Fado.

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
Like what I am

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,280
trying to say is that if you look at this site,

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,440
this is Iftikhan's nuclear

85
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,440
technology site and here you will

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
see clearly that there has been a heavy loss.

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,519

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
You will clearly see the losses due to the bombing done by America.  But what

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,000
I was telling you is that the most

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,080
important site for Iran is for

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
the nuclear site and it becomes important

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,519
because you can see

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,000
clearly that it has been built

94
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,680
quite below this mountain here, it has been

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,280
built several feet below and in this you will

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
clearly see that here is the

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
entrance to go below the nuclear side, to go

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
there which is the underground complex and

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,959
apart from this you will see this support building outside, there

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,519
is a security check point here, which means vehicles will be coming and going from here,

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,239
so this entire site is basically for two.

104
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,560
Now what has happened is that the B2

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,440
bombers used by America yesterday and the

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,080
GDU57 used here, you can see, must have caused a

107
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,920
lot of damage

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
because if you see the way it

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,159
penetrated here, if you

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,000
look carefully at the way your missile must have gone

111
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,080
in because its job is that

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,560
it does not blast first.

113
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,560
It penetrates first.  It goes very deep below the ground

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,360
and then it blasts.

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,519
Even here if you see, this bomb, GBU 57, is

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,000
penetrating.  He must have gone downwards

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,239
and then carried out the blast there.

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,240
So on the surface what we can see is

119
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,479
that yes, a blast has taken place.  But

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,120

121
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,040
right now you cannot say with 100% certainty how much loss might have actually occurred.

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,199
Even though America is saying that yes,

123
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
we have destroyed everything here.  Iran's

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
entire nuclear program goes back many years.

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,120
These things are going to speak.

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,199
But exactly, we are not 100% sure right now.

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
Now it is possible that if some things come up in tomorrow's date then we will get to

128
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,120
know.  But

129
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,120
amidst all these things, a very

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
interesting thing has happened.  Many American

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,800
officials and Israeli officials have pointed

132
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,120
out that Iran may actually have

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,840
already

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
started shifting things here.  That is,

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,360
things are coming out from multiple intelligence reports

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,040
and it is being told that

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,000
Iran has moved up to 400 kilograms

138
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,840
of enriched uranium and the enriched uranium

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,039
that we talk about is the high purity

140
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,600
enriched uranium of 60% purity, so

141
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,240
our main facilities and the main facility is

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,479
this Fado one, a few hours

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,479
before that means a

144
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,440
few hours before the US strike or a few days before that, the

145
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,280
entire enriched enriched

146
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,960
uranium here must have been shifted

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,199
and why am I saying this, you

148
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,800
can see, some satellite pictures have been

149
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,280
shared here and you can see that it has been

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,560
said before the US strikes on

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,639
Irshan Naataj and Fado, the

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,320
satellite images of Maxar have come out, in which it was told

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,440
that about 16 trucks were parked in Fado,

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,360
heavy machinery was also present there on 19 and 20 June,

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
again I will show you a little bit,

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,039
this Fado site.  Isn't it okay?

157
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,720
First, let me show you this site of Fado.

158
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,560
If you, what did I

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
tell you, this is the support building here

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,400
and this is the security check point.  This is what

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
I am focusing on.  You are seeing

162
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,919
these security check points for the vehicles that come and go from here,

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,680

164
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,759
I am showing it to you by zooming in here.

165
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,919
If you see this, you will

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,080
see a clear cut in it.  Many of these

167
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,639
trucks etc., around 16 trucks are

168
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,960
standing there and it is possible because

169
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,039
it is being said here that most likely

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,680
through the trucks that were standing there, the

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,600
heavy machinery that was present there, it was

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,919
most likely because it is obvious that

173
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
Iran also knew that an attack could happen at any time.  The

174
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,240
whole world knows

175
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,160
that the Fado nuclear site is the

176
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
most important for Iran.  So it is

177
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,280
possible that Iran has already started shifting its

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,000
enriched uranium of high porosity (60%

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,240
porosity)

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and it is most likely being said

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,759
that

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
no one knows where it has been shifted.  It is an

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,120
undisclosed location, the entire site will be

184
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,680
fortified and it may also be

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,240

186
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,479
stored in underground bunkers, that is, deep below the ground,

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,720
and it will be present in the military control area.

188
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,960
Most likely this is being reported

189
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,440
and the US satellite surveillance

190
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,680
, cyber intelligence may

191
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,160
not have detected this thing and the inspectors

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,479
of International Atomic Energy Agency were

193
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479

194
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,560
not present there for the last few days because Iran had

195
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,720
refused, because look, Iran has also been

196
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,560
saying repeatedly that the IAEA

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
inspectors are sent deliberately

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
so that things can be inspected and

199
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
things can be tracked.  So but for the last

200
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,639
few days he was not present there

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,960
on the site.  So because of this it is being said

202
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,199
that now it is possible that

203
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
Iran might have taken advantage of this opportunity here and

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,919

205
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,319
tried to shift it on an immediate basis.  Now see its analysis.

206
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,120
See, I told you 400 kg of

207
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,400
uranium, highly enriched uranium.  So

208
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,960
why only 400 kg?  Because 60% enriched

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,919
uranium it is only one step away from

210
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,400
weapons grade 90% purity.  Meaning you are just one

211
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,360
step away from making a nuclear bomb

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,400
through 90% purity.  And

213
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,360
if you have 400 kg of 60% uranium,

214
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,039
it means you can make four to five nuclear bombs.  Do

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
you understand

216
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,360
what the consequence is?  So this is what we call

217
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,560
breakout time.  Meaning, how much more time do you

218
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,800
need to obtain weapon grade uranium.

219
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,360
So basically it is being said that it is a

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,199
time of just a few weeks.  Meaning, Iran

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,000
can make whatever it wants if it wants.  Ten if Iran has

222
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,800
this material safely hidden.  So in a way, the

223
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,879
main objective of America's strike, its

224
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
main aim, would have failed somewhere or the other.

225
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
Yes, it also depends on the

226
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,240
core element of nuclear deterrence,

227
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,640
which means that Iran already has the knowledge now.

228
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,880
No matter how many

229
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,200
sites America attacks, no matter what it does.

230
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,760
But the main knowledge is that

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
how and in which steps can you make a nuclear weapon.

232
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,760
So Iran also says

233
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
that even if you attack our sites,

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,240

235
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,640
how will you destroy the knowledge and wisdom that we have gained regarding this

236
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,880
?  So if the core element, the core

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,440
element here, is 60% enriched

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,600
uranium, if Iran has it, it means this

239
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
could be a big failure for

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,839
America and that is why many

241
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,839
questions are being asked here that if this thing has happened

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,680
now, see, things will now become crystal

243
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,600
clear and we will know about it in the future

244
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
but now many questions are being asked from America, was there

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,160
a breakdown of satellite

246
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
surveillance, means has there been

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,160

248
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,760
any kind of breakdown in satellite surveillance of America which is considered to be very strong, has there been any

249
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Iranian movement,

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,000
means Iran could have also done it, by

251
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,920
showing non-nuclear logistics and showing

252
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,760
civilians that look these trucks

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,680
etc. belong to civilians, so

254
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,320
Iran has tried to trick through that.

255
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,399
Dude Iran uses electronic warfare

256
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,320
to confuse America and

257
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,080
other western countries so that

258
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
whenever they are tracking here, they will not even know

259
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,240
that uranium is passing from there.

260
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,200
Did the US rush?  This is also the biggest

261
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,440
question

262
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
whether America hastily

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,519
attacked Iran without gathering proper intelligence.  So overall it

264
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,680
is obvious that America's main goal

265
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,760
may be in danger.  And see

266
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,279
what is its consequence?  The first thing is

267
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,320
that if this is true then Iran has in

268
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,800
a way succeeded in its objective.

269
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,560
Secondly, now you will see that in Iran also, a

270
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,240
propaganda type of victory or whatever you may

271
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,399
call it, is being shown in the media there that

272
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,640
look, the capability that Iran has is

273
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,880
safe at this time and in a way, it will

274
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,200
also act as a psychological deterrent

275
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,040
because till now it was being said that

276
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
its capability has been destroyed due to the

277
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,959
US strike but

278
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,760
now things will become uncertain here, there will

279
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,000
always be a doubt whether Iran

280
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,760
still has that capability, so because of this, the

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,800

282
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,600
series of nuclear threat may still

283
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,519
continue here and it is possible that now Iran will be

284
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600

285
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,320
able to negotiate and deal with America strongly.

286
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,320
As far as America is concerned, even if

287
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
it has carried out a strike, it will be

288
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,160
considered a limited strategic gain.  This could be

289
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
a major embarrassment to America's military success.

290
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,760
So let's see

291
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,600
what ultimately comes out regarding this.

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
But this was a very

293
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,800
important news which I

294
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
wanted to tell you.  I hope you have

295
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,720
understood well and before leaving, can you tell me a very

296
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
interesting question that in

297
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,680
natural uranium,

298
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,320
approximately how much percentage of fissile

299
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,800
uranium 235 is there which is

300
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,959
used for nuclear weapons, uranium 235, so

301
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,440
how much fissile means how much purity of

302
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,200
uranium 235 is found in natural uranium,

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,640
you all know its right answer will be

304
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,240
found on my Instagram,

305
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,760
