00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,160
Hello, Welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,240
Prashant Dhawan. Now, as I had told you

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
several weeks ago,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,679
at the time of Operation Sindoor, when Operation Sindoor was initially

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,480
paused, that Donald Trump has

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,320
become after the Nobel Peace Prize and now,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
because of this, he will be visiting India many times for the sake of the Nobel Peace Prize.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,240

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480
Recently Pakistan's Army General and their

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,359
Field Marshal, whatever you

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,239
want to call him, Asim Munir, went to the White House,

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,040
Donald Trump hosted him, he openly expressed his

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,680
disagreement with India that

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
I had got the India-Pakistan mediation done and

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,000
I had helped him a lot.  Again Donald

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,879
Trump repeated the same thing here and even

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,200
on the internet, especially on the Indian side,

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,200
people were making a lot of memes about Asim Munir at White House.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,840
Many memes were actually

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,960
quite funny.  A larger question is being

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,760
raised geopolitically

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,399
whether Donald Trump has chosen Pakistan

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,600
as America's main geopolitical

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,520
partner till 2025, as long as Donald Trump

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,760
remains the President of the US. Is this a

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
tactical romance? Tactical romance meaning that Donald

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,799
Trump will use Pakistan for a few years

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,280
after that the

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,240
relations between the two countries will deteriorate or

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,880
a new inner circle of Trump has been formed

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,360
in which Asim Munir, the real man who runs

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,520
Pakistan, is included.  It is interesting that

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,000
Trump has ignored Shabaz Sharif, Nawaz Sharif and has

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,960

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,280

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
started engaging directly with the main man who runs Pakistan, Asim Munir.  Now

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,840
why did Trump suddenly invite Asim Munir

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,439
to the White House?

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,280
Many reports are being published regarding this.

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,000
Some people are saying that Donald Trump

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,079
wants military basis from Asim Munir.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,479
In return we will give you security trade deal.

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,360
Asim will also assure Munir

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
that if tomorrow India attacks

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,119
Pakistan with Brahmos missile or

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,680
any other type of missile, then the

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,759
US will come to Pakistan's defence and will

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,240
try its best to ensure that Pakistan does not suffer much damage.

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,719
But honestly if you ask me, what

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,280
is the main concern of Donald Trump due to which

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,800
he is giving so much respect to Asim Munir.

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Calling you to the White House.   They are

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,840
feeding me food etc.  The main issue here

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
is Israel and Iran war.  I

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
already told you.  See, India was destroying Pakistan's air

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,239
bases.   The

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,319
US was panicking and now the US

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
media Bloomberg, Washington Post, etc. are

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,200
all writing that Donald Trump

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,840
needs Asim Munir's help in the Iran-Israel war.

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,319
Now again you can understand that it is

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,480
not the case that if Asim Munir tells Israel to

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,959
please not attack Iran now.  Israel

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,440
will agree.  I mean you can imagine.

65
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, Trump is a very unstable leader.

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,000
I had told you earlier also.  You can imagine the respect Israel has for Asim

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,200
Munir.  The

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,400
only use the

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,120
US can make of Pakistan is that if tomorrow it has to launch a

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,200
major military attack on Iran, then it would

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
get indirect support from Pakistan.  The

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,080
US gets intelligence support on the

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,720
basis of Pakistan.

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,800
That will be great.  The US will

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
reward Pakistan greatly in return.

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,080
If you go into history, you will check

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,239
that in return for the

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,400
help Pakistan gave to the US and other NATO

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,440
countries in the Afghanistan War, Pakistan was

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,000
given billions of dollars.  Well,

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
I would say that Iran is a bigger case than Afghanistan.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,519
If Pakistan helps USA in the case of Iran.

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,560
USA will reward

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,879
Pakistan treacherously.  Yes,

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
I don't know what happens next.  If someone like You Know

86
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
Iran survives then how will they respond to it

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
etc.  But here you will see that the

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
reporter will ask Donald Trump that when Asim

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,440
Munir had come, there was a discussion about the Israel-Iran war, so

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,400

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,720
Donald Trump said this to the

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,720
Army Chief, you talk about Iran then better than

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,480
 

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,159
most they know Iran very well,

95
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,200
Pakistan knows very well

96
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:06,080
about Iran and they are happy about anything, they know actually probably better but they see now he agrees with

97
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,799

98
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:14,120

99
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,120

100
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,880
me, here he has

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,720
said in contact with Iran-Israel that he agrees with

102
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,440
me, but of course later on he will keep

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,840

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,040
repeating the same thing that the India-Pakistan war was stopped etc.

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,280
but it is very important to

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,960
mention that somewhere in Pakistan

107
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
also there is an agreement regarding the fact

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
that Iran should not have nuclear weapons.  If

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,400
Iran gets

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,639
nuclear weapons tomorrow, then

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
Pakistan's geopolitics will

112
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,199
also reduce.  And recently

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,199
a former White House official in the US has

114
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
also presented a theory to the media

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,520
that this could be the grand plan of the USA.

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Once again this offer can be given

117
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,040
to Pakistan that Israel and US will

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,120
stop their action against Iran.  If Iran hands over

119
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,520
whatever nuclear unexploded material it has, whatever

120
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,440
uranium enriched material it has at a

121
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,080
certain level, whatever nuclear supply

122
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,520
it has, to Pakistan, Pakistan

123
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,000
already has nuclear weapons, then in a

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,560
way you can say that there will be an understanding

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,880
here that Iran will no longer have any

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,240
means to make nuclear weapons.

127
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,280
Now again this is just a theory but the

128
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,600
thing to note is that Asim Munir and

129
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,759
Donald Trump have started supporting each other so much that

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,240
Asim Munir has

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,039
openly said that Donald Trump deserves the

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,440
Nobel Peace Prize and the

133
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,400
White House itself has confirmed that

134
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,720
Pakistan's Asim Munir has backed

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,440
Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,840
this is the situation today that the USA

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,720
President needs the support of

138
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,720
Pakistan's Field Army Chief or whichever

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,520
field, whatever position they have

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,800
given to him here, Field Marshal's support is

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,880
openly announced by the White House that yes,

142
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120
Asim Munir believes that Donald Trump should

143
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,960
get the Nobel Peace Prize despite the

144
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
people of his own country protesting against it.

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
You must have seen in USA that

146
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,800
when Asim Munir was roaming around,

147
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,280
many people from Pakistan protested against him.

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
Primarily those Pakistanis who

149
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,199
are supporters of Imran Khan believe that it is Asim

150
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,880
Munir who has kept Imran Khan in jail.

151
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,160
So, there were a lot of

152
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,479
protests against this and at one time, Donald

153
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Trump kept saying that he has a very good friendship

154
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,919
with Imran Khan and hence I would say

155
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,880
never trust Trump, which means whatever he is saying

156
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,039
today.  Let's take a U-turn like this after a year.

157
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
I mean look, every leader takes a U-turn.

158
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,319
Even if it is local politics.  If

159
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,479
someone takes a U-turn in local politics, we tend to

160
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,880
focus more on him

161
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,199
changing his stance, changing parties, etc.  But

162
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,840
even at high level leaders often take U-turns.  But the

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,400
way Donald Trump openly

164
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,720
ignores everything else for the sake of his interest.

165
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
This is setting an example of a different level.

166
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
And now the question that will

167
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,120
come to your mind is can

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,080
Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize

169
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,560

170
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
on the nomination of Pakistan Army General Asim Munir?  That you know, Asim Munir and

171
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,400
Pakistan should nominate Trump for Nobel

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,880
Peace Prize and they will say that he should get

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
billions, they will say that yes,

174
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,120
India was about to destroy us, but

175
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Trump came in the middle and saved

176
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,599
us, otherwise Modi would have done anything, give him

177
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,599
Nobel Peace Prize for this, well, let

178
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,919
me say here that this can definitely happen, this can very much

179
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,080
happen, and I had

180
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,960
told you a long time ago that

181
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,479
even during the time of Operation Sindoor, Donald Trump had an obsession with

182
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,639
bringing himself at par with Barack Obama.

183
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,120
Obama became US President twice.

184
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,759
Trump became US President twice. Now,

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,240
Obama has a special thing that Trump

186
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,280
still doesn't have, a Nobel Peace

187
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,560
Prize. Trump has said many times that if my

188
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,880
name was Obama, I would have received the Nobel Peace

189
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Prize by now. He has said this many times

190
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,240
in news conferences. Actually,

191
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,720
I remember when he became President for the first time, at

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,360
that time too, around 2020,

193
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,520
Trump had said that the

194
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,039
President of Ethiopia should not get the Nobel  The Peace

195
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,440
Prize should go to Trump Trump.

196
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,000
He himself said, I deserve Nobel Peace, please

197
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,080
not AB Ahmed.  And you will see that over the

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,479
years, Trump has said in many interviews

199
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,879
that Obama got the Nobel Prize

200
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,639
without any reason.  I got the Abraham

201
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
Accords done.  I brought peace to the Middle East.

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,080
Well, there is

203
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,160
no peace in the Middle East right now.  But Trump

204
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,919
said at that time that I have done such a good job.

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,759
I did not get the Nobel Peace Prize in this world.

206
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,479
Gave it to Obama.

207
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,240
So now look at Trump's condition.  At any

208
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,080
cost, they want that

209
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,240
he too should get the Nobel Prize in this term.  Now the

210
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,640
question arises, on what topic should we meet?

211
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
Ukraine Russia war was not ended.   Was the

212
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
issue going on between Israel and Gaza

213
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,240
resolved?  He didn’t even get that finished.

214
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,480
Now the Israel-Iran issue has started afresh.  There are

215
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,200
three conflicts going on

216
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,160
during this.  They could not finish even one of them

217
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,800
and you know in the coming

218
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,440
mid-term elections, their rivals will

219
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,839
ask them, what did you do in foreign policy

220
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,480
?  There, Trump will have a Turk

221
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,800
's Ace.  Asim Munir said, I

222
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,040
stopped the war, I stopped the nuclear war and for

223
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,120
this reason I should get the Nobel Peace

224
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
Prize.  But I know they will not give it to me

225
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,760
because they are biased, this, that etc.  So this is going to be

226
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Trump's political narrative

227
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,560
in the upcoming mid-term elections.  Now here

228
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,800
you people will ask what should India do at this time

229
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,839
?  Looking at all this, I believe that

230
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,480
India should constantly

231
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,160
keep improving its relations with Israel

232
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,120
because Israel is a much more stable partner

233
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,680
of India compared to the US.  Don't know anything in the US.

234
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,839
Especially under Trump, he might

235
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,519
say something today and something else next month.  Still don't

236
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
say anything bad about India.   He

237
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,760
says that Narendra Modi is my friend

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,760
and this and that etc. but at the same time Trump

239
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,480
knows very well that whatever he is doing

240
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,880
today will worsen the relations of US with India.

241
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,360
So I believe,

242
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,279
first of all, if I talk from a long term perspective, even

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,279
if we

244
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,600
talk about military projects, joint production, then

245
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,680
Israel is definitely

246
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,839
going to be India's first choice

247
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,399
rather than US, after this Asim Ali episode, so

248
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,040
definitely, apart from that, India does

249
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,959
not have much role in the Israel-Iran

250
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,880
conflict, we want to stay away from it,

251
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,440
we have said that both the countries

252
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,320
are important for us, if Pakistan has to take a pro-

253
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,399
US approach, then whatever consequences will happen after that,

254
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,480

255
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,120
Pakistan will suffer them too.  They did

256
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,519
help the USA in Afghanistan,

257
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,279
but after that, lakhs of Pakistanis were killed and

258
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,760
a wave of terrorism swept across

259
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,480
Pakistan, Pakistan had to suffer the consequences.

260
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,640
So for now, No One Knows which path Asim Munir is

261
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,240
taking Pakistan on.

262
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,880
But this thing is certain.  There are no free lunches.

263
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,760
This lunch which Trump has organised for Asim Munir.

264
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,920
Its bill will be very big.  He will be late.  But we will have to

265
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
see that bill.  Will Pakistan be able to fill it or

266
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,600
not?  And finally I will ask you guys a

267
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,600
question here.  You may have heard

268
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,279
about the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

269
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
Every year they publish their report.  Let us

270
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,519
tell you

271
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,680
how many nuclear weapons each country in the world has.

272
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
According to their estimate,

273
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,360
their report has again come out recently.

274
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,360
He has claimed that India has

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
more nuclear weapons than Pakistan.

276
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,399
And here I am asking you this question.

277
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,200
According to this report,

278
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,160
which two countries have the largest number of nuclear weapons in the world

279
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,160
?  Here are your

280
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,399
options France USA, Russia USA, China

281
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,240
India or Israel India.  Answer in the comment section.

282
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,839

283
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,920
I will give heart to the comments of those who give the correct answer so that

284
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,079
other people can understand what the correct answer is.

285
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,160
Look, I believe that if you are

286
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,399
not using Artificial Intelligence

287
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,200
in your work today, then you are living in a different era

288
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,680
because with the help of AI, you

289
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
can do many jobs.  You can make a lot of

290
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,760
money.  You can upskill yourself.

291
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,399
For example, suppose I

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,880
want to show that Captain America is

293
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,399

294
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,560
eating Vada Pav in some busy street of Mumbai and above it is written a very

295
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,279
attractive text 'Yummy' then

296
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,160
I can easily do this by entering the right prompt

297
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,880
and here you can see it was

298
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,760
just that easy, you

299
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,399
can make many variants of this.  If I want to move this image, then

300
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,079
I can do it in the way

301
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,959
you can see on your screen.

302
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,680
I

303
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,000
can make this image move with the help of lots of generative AI software.   I

304
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,320
can create a story.  I can

305
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,040
pretty much do anything.  And this is just one

306
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,560
small, I mean one very small,

307
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,800
aspect of generative AI.

308
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,800
