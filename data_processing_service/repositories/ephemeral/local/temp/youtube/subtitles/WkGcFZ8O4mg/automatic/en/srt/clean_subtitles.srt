Hello, Welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Now, as I had told you several weeks ago, at the time of Operation Sindoor, when Operation Sindoor was initially paused, that Donald Trump has become after the Nobel Peace Prize and now, because of this, he will be visiting India many times for the sake of the Nobel Peace Prize. Recently Pakistan's Army General and their Field Marshal, whatever you want to call him, Asim Munir, went to the White House, Donald Trump hosted him, he openly expressed his disagreement with India that I had got the India-Pakistan mediation done and I had helped him a lot.  Again Donald Trump repeated the same thing here and even on the internet, especially on the Indian side, people were making a lot of memes about Asim Munir at White House. Many memes were actually quite funny.  A larger question is being raised geopolitically whether Donald Trump has chosen Pakistan as America's main geopolitical partner till 2025, as long as Donald Trump remains the President of the US. Is this a tactical romance? Tactical romance meaning that Donald Trump will use Pakistan for a few years after that the relations between the two countries will deteriorate or a new inner circle of Trump has been formed in which Asim Munir, the real man who runs Pakistan, is included.  It is interesting that Trump has ignored Shabaz Sharif, Nawaz Sharif and has started engaging directly with the main man who runs Pakistan, Asim Munir.  Now why did Trump suddenly invite Asim Munir to the White House? Many reports are being published regarding this. Some people are saying that Donald Trump wants military basis from Asim Munir. In return we will give you security trade deal. Asim will also assure Munir that if tomorrow India attacks Pakistan with Brahmos missile or any other type of missile, then the US will come to Pakistan's defence and will try its best to ensure that Pakistan does not suffer much damage. But honestly if you ask me, what is the main concern of Donald Trump due to which he is giving so much respect to Asim Munir. Calling you to the White House.   They are feeding me food etc.  The main issue here is Israel and Iran war.  I already told you.  See, India was destroying Pakistan's air bases.   The US was panicking and now the US media Bloomberg, Washington Post, etc. are all writing that Donald Trump needs Asim Munir's help in the Iran-Israel war. Now again you can understand that it is not the case that if Asim Munir tells Israel to please not attack Iran now.  Israel will agree.  I mean you can imagine. Well, Trump is a very unstable leader. I had told you earlier also.  You can imagine the respect Israel has for Asim Munir.  The only use the US can make of Pakistan is that if tomorrow it has to launch a major military attack on Iran, then it would get indirect support from Pakistan.  The US gets intelligence support on the basis of Pakistan. That will be great.  The US will reward Pakistan greatly in return. If you go into history, you will check that in return for the help Pakistan gave to the US and other NATO countries in the Afghanistan War, Pakistan was given billions of dollars.  Well, I would say that Iran is a bigger case than Afghanistan. If Pakistan helps USA in the case of Iran. USA will reward Pakistan treacherously.  Yes, I don't know what happens next.  If someone like You Know Iran survives then how will they respond to it etc.  But here you will see that the reporter will ask Donald Trump that when Asim Munir had come, there was a discussion about the Israel-Iran war, so Donald Trump said this to the Army Chief, you talk about Iran then better than most they know Iran very well, Pakistan knows very well about Iran and they are happy about anything, they know actually probably better but they see now he agrees with me, here he has said in contact with Iran-Israel that he agrees with me, but of course later on he will keep repeating the same thing that the India-Pakistan war was stopped etc. but it is very important to mention that somewhere in Pakistan also there is an agreement regarding the fact that Iran should not have nuclear weapons.  If Iran gets nuclear weapons tomorrow, then Pakistan's geopolitics will also reduce.  And recently a former White House official in the US has also presented a theory to the media that this could be the grand plan of the USA. Once again this offer can be given to Pakistan that Israel and US will stop their action against Iran.  If Iran hands over whatever nuclear unexploded material it has, whatever uranium enriched material it has at a certain level, whatever nuclear supply it has, to Pakistan, Pakistan already has nuclear weapons, then in a way you can say that there will be an understanding here that Iran will no longer have any means to make nuclear weapons. Now again this is just a theory but the thing to note is that Asim Munir and Donald Trump have started supporting each other so much that Asim Munir has openly said that Donald Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and the White House itself has confirmed that Pakistan's Asim Munir has backed Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now this is the situation today that the USA President needs the support of Pakistan's Field Army Chief or whichever field, whatever position they have given to him here, Field Marshal's support is openly announced by the White House that yes, Asim Munir believes that Donald Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize despite the people of his own country protesting against it. You must have seen in USA that when Asim Munir was roaming around, many people from Pakistan protested against him. Primarily those Pakistanis who are supporters of Imran Khan believe that it is Asim Munir who has kept Imran Khan in jail. So, there were a lot of protests against this and at one time, Donald Trump kept saying that he has a very good friendship with Imran Khan and hence I would say never trust Trump, which means whatever he is saying today.  Let's take a U-turn like this after a year. I mean look, every leader takes a U-turn. Even if it is local politics.  If someone takes a U-turn in local politics, we tend to focus more on him changing his stance, changing parties, etc.  But even at high level leaders often take U-turns.  But the way Donald Trump openly ignores everything else for the sake of his interest. This is setting an example of a different level. And now the question that will come to your mind is can Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize on the nomination of Pakistan Army General Asim Munir?  That you know, Asim Munir and Pakistan should nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize and they will say that he should get billions, they will say that yes, India was about to destroy us, but Trump came in the middle and saved us, otherwise Modi would have done anything, give him Nobel Peace Prize for this, well, let me say here that this can definitely happen, this can very much happen, and I had told you a long time ago that even during the time of Operation Sindoor, Donald Trump had an obsession with bringing himself at par with Barack Obama. Obama became US President twice. Trump became US President twice. Now, Obama has a special thing that Trump still doesn't have, a Nobel Peace Prize. Trump has said many times that if my name was Obama, I would have received the Nobel Peace Prize by now. He has said this many times in news conferences. Actually, I remember when he became President for the first time, at that time too, around 2020, Trump had said that the President of Ethiopia should not get the Nobel  The Peace Prize should go to Trump Trump. He himself said, I deserve Nobel Peace, please not AB Ahmed.  And you will see that over the years, Trump has said in many interviews that Obama got the Nobel Prize without any reason.  I got the Abraham Accords done.  I brought peace to the Middle East. Well, there is no peace in the Middle East right now.  But Trump said at that time that I have done such a good job. I did not get the Nobel Peace Prize in this world. Gave it to Obama. So now look at Trump's condition.  At any cost, they want that he too should get the Nobel Prize in this term.  Now the question arises, on what topic should we meet? Ukraine Russia war was not ended.   Was the issue going on between Israel and Gaza resolved?  He didnâ€™t even get that finished. Now the Israel-Iran issue has started afresh.  There are three conflicts going on during this.  They could not finish even one of them and you know in the coming mid-term elections, their rivals will ask them, what did you do in foreign policy ?  There, Trump will have a Turk 's Ace.  Asim Munir said, I stopped the war, I stopped the nuclear war and for this reason I should get the Nobel Peace Prize.  But I know they will not give it to me because they are biased, this, that etc.  So this is going to be Trump's political narrative in the upcoming mid-term elections.  Now here you people will ask what should India do at this time ?  Looking at all this, I believe that India should constantly keep improving its relations with Israel because Israel is a much more stable partner of India compared to the US.  Don't know anything in the US. Especially under Trump, he might say something today and something else next month.  Still don't say anything bad about India.   He says that Narendra Modi is my friend and this and that etc. but at the same time Trump knows very well that whatever he is doing today will worsen the relations of US with India. So I believe, first of all, if I talk from a long term perspective, even if we talk about military projects, joint production, then Israel is definitely going to be India's first choice rather than US, after this Asim Ali episode, so definitely, apart from that, India does not have much role in the Israel-Iran conflict, we want to stay away from it, we have said that both the countries are important for us, if Pakistan has to take a pro- US approach, then whatever consequences will happen after that, Pakistan will suffer them too.  They did help the USA in Afghanistan, but after that, lakhs of Pakistanis were killed and a wave of terrorism swept across Pakistan, Pakistan had to suffer the consequences. So for now, No One Knows which path Asim Munir is taking Pakistan on. But this thing is certain.  There are no free lunches. This lunch which Trump has organised for Asim Munir. Its bill will be very big.  He will be late.  But we will have to see that bill.  Will Pakistan be able to fill it or not?  And finally I will ask you guys a question here.  You may have heard about the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Every year they publish their report.  Let us tell you how many nuclear weapons each country in the world has. According to their estimate, their report has again come out recently. He has claimed that India has more nuclear weapons than Pakistan. And here I am asking you this question. According to this report, which two countries have the largest number of nuclear weapons in the world ?  Here are your options France USA, Russia USA, China India or Israel India.
