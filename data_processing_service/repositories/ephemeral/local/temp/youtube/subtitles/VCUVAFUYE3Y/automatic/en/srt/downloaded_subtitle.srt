00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
Dr. Aloc, welcome back to the Ravi show.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,440
Pleasure to be here. You said that

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,359
sometimes when you're doing your brain

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,040
surgery, some memories may be missing.

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,000
They are missing and they don't know

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,160
it's missing. Computer brain interfaces

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,839
here. Does that mean that your biology

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
can also get hacked? Now there is a

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,240
danger. You'll be able to completely

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,920
influence the brain in many many ways.

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,600
How do you explain the subconscious mind

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,680
to a 5-year-old? Everything that has

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
happened in the past, all the events,

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,400
the hurts, the pains, the traumas, the

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,239
joys and the sorrows, they are all in

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,040
the subconscious mind. One of the

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,640
problems of humankind is that our brain

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,239
is always living in the past and the

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
future because of the subconscious. I

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,760
may know that alcohol is not good for

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
me, but the craving for it is so much

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,480
those chemicals and agents go and stick

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,239
to those areas of the brain. Now the

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
brain cannot get stimulated by anything

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,320
else.

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Reality is created by the logical mind.

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,440
But expectations are created by the

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
emotional. Absolutely. The suffering of

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
all of mankind is purely because of the

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,399
imbalance between the two. Now I am

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,239
hoping that the digital technology

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,400
things like neural link brings about

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
harmony between the lower and the higher

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,799
brain.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,200
What's the first superpower that

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,040
computer brain interfaces will give us?

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,439
The most important thing that we see

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,439
right now

39
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,640
is Dr. Alo Sharma is a neurosurgeon who

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
we've featured on TRS in the past. He's

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,479
got his own cult audience because his

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,880
subject matter is

43
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:36,320
always practically important for all of

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,600
us. Neuroscience is one of those domains

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,439
of biology that is being researched upon

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,040
heavily and neuroscientists all over the

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,360
world are constantly finding newer

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,479
secrets of the brain. We're discovering

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,119
deeper layers of our own mind. Today's

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,399
episode is about these slightly deeper

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,840
layers. Of course, we've spoken about

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,000
meditation. Of course, we've spoken

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,640
about sleep,

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,360
neuroplasticity, but this is an attempt

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,040
to help you understand about the higher

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,319
states of the brain. What is the human

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,040
body evolving into next? We came from

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,400
monkeys, but where are we going? These

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,400
are the kind of questions that'll be

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
answered in this neuroscience special of

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,280
TRS. It's for anyone who enjoys

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,840
psychology and brain biology. Features

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,840
Dr. Aluk Sharma on TRS. Once again,

64
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,119
[Music]

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Dr. Aloc, welcome back to the Renvi

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,840
show. Pleasure to be here. Uh let's dive

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,840
straight in. Yeah. Oh, wait. Before we

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,800
dive straight in, there's something I I

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,760
want to talk about. I want to share. Uh

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,120
and it's in context with what happened

71
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,239
recently. Your response to everything

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
that happened in life. We all make

73
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,760
mistakes. We make errors. You know,

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,480
things happen to all of us. That those

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,280
are things we can't control. However,

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,599
our response to that is in our hands.

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:21,400
And what I want you to know is the way

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:24,000
you responded was in my views in in my

79
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,640
opinion the classic definition of the

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,080
word equity. There is a word in English

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,400
called equanity. Equity is about being

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,120
balanced about being calm and about

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,760
being serene in the middle of whatever

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,200
happens. And I believe that your

85
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,040
responses were u you know a definition

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
of

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,680
equimity. They were mature. Uh we never

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,560
saw you go off the handle. We never saw

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,120
you criticize anybody. Uh you were

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,840
apologetic where it had to be. You were,

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,000
you know, uh firm where you had to be.

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,519
So not just as somebody who has been on

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,519
your podcast, but as somebody who is

94
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,159
your parents age. I mean I'm I'm the

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
same age as your parents. Uh as a

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,840
medical doctor, as a neurosurgeon, as a

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040
neuroscientist, as a medical teacher,

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
you know, I've been a medical teacher

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,400
for 30 years, about a 100 students going

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,680
through us every year. I want you to

101
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,919
know that my respect for you uh is

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
actually enhanced. Thank you. You know,

103
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,600
and you know, when I did my podcast with

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
you earlier, because of your age, you

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,800
were always I always saw you as a kid.

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,720
Okay. You're well known and well known

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,560
in the field but you're still a kid

108
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,440
today. I see you with different eyes.

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,919
You know I I see that you have grown and

110
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,160
matured. Uh so as in that capacity that

111
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,040
my respect, my closeness, my affection

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,040
for you has not changed a little bit. In

113
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,400
fact, it's just got enhanced. Thank you.

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,320
Even from that generation, all right, uh

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,400
at no point did anybody uh think of

116
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,919
anything that happened and anything that

117
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,639
is negative. There was all they were

118
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,800
always supportive, caring of everything

119
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,440
that you've done and everything that you

120
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,680
did. So I just wanted you to know that.

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,400
Thank you. So thank you. Means a lot.

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,720
All I'll say is I really enjoy my job. I

123
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,759
really enjoy dissecting knowledge and I

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,520
really enjoy meeting people like

125
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,000
yourself where I can extract that

126
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,720
knowledge for the sake of the world but

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
also obviously for the sake of my own

128
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,800
curiosity. So I don't know if you're

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,120
familiar with this show called Black

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Mirror but uh it's basically it's a

131
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,759
horror show without ghosts. The villain

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,759
or the ghost is the dark aspect of

133
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,600
technology. So they try highlighting

134
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
technologies that already exist around

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
us or are currently being developed in

136
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
the present and how those technologies

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,360
will affect human life. And one of the

138
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,160
hot topics within Black Mirror uh as

139
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,880
well as the show called Severance is

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,280
what we call the computer brain

141
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,080
interface. Now sir, you're a brain

142
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,080
surgeon but I have hung out with you as

143
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,360
well. So I know that you're a student

144
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,039
when it comes to the subject of

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,479
neuroscience.

146
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,919
um you're already working with stem cell

147
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,440
therapies. Uh I think that you're one of

148
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,319
those doctors who's on the cutting edge

149
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,919
of medical tech. My first question to

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,440
you is related to this computer brain

151
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,160
interface angle. Uh I think it's going

152
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,639
to be made completely public within 5

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,280
years time. How long have you been a

154
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,479
brain surgeon for? Since 1992. Okay. So

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,240
30 years. 30 years. Yeah.

156
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,160
Um, did you ever think of this reality

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,039
where technology will make its way into

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,319
the biology of the brain? Well, actually

159
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,360
that's a very interesting question

160
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,199
because they have already done this. So

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,120
um uh you know in the late 1990s I was

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,919
the first to do something called motor

163
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,400
cortex stimulation for intractable pain

164
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,120
where we took electrodes and implanted

165
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,440
the electrodes onto the motor cortex and

166
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,240
then uh connected it to a pacemaker

167
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,080
which was below and that stimulated uh

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,160
the you know the motor cortex and

169
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,240
removed the most difficult and

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,160
intractable pain that there was. What is

171
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
the motor cortex? Uh the motor cortex is

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,400
a part of the brain that actually

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,400
controls our movements. But uh when the

174
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,919
motor cortex gets stimulated, it

175
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,639
suppresses the pain you know and uh so

176
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,560
there was uh you know pain which would

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,280
not respond to anything we were able to

178
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,800
do that. So my first experience was in

179
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,080
implanting electrodes on the brain.

180
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Subsequently I implanted a lot of

181
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,360
electrodes for patients in coma. So we

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
have patients in intractable coma uh who

183
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
are just unconscious in a vegetative

184
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,199
state and what we would do is we would

185
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
take electrodes and and put it implanted

186
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,840
in the cervical spine and again

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,919
stimulate the brain uh so that if there

188
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,759
was any possibility of recovery they

189
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,680
would recover. So I've already worked

190
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
with this. Uh and did it work with them?

191
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,319
Yeah. So it did work. The the pain uh it

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,280
helped significantly. Then in the coma

193
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,000
we had some patients who did improve and

194
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,680
um uh you know uh one of them was

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
actually Ramnad Parker. He was a

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,120
well-known cricket. I used to open with

197
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,759
Gawaskar. He had a a very uh severe

198
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,479
accident and injury and I I did his uh

199
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,400
stimulation operation. In fact the whole

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,319
Indian cricket team had a benefit match

201
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,599
just to be able to support him for that.

202
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,440
Okay. So, I've already done this, but

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,680
when I was doing this, the technology

204
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,039
was not as refined, you know, the

205
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,279
electrodes were larger, uh the the

206
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,519
equipment was a little, you know, what

207
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,120
it was 15, 20 years ago. But now with

208
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,039
everything getting, you know, microized,

209
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,480
smaller, more easy to control, earlier

210
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,240
we had to, you know, have wires coming

211
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
out and stimulators. Now, you can do a

212
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,640
whole lot of this wirelessly. uh I

213
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,399
believe the future will be an interface

214
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,080
of technology with the brain because at

215
00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:00,440
the end the human brain is also you know

216
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,040
one of the most fascinating brilliant uh

217
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,440
computer-like creations that nature has

218
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,920
ever evolved. Yeah. Uh I'm an engineer,

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,640
you're a doctor. I see the world in

220
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,120
terms of systems, flowcharts and perhaps

221
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,600
the flow of electricity and power within

222
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,200
those systems. That's what a computer

223
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,839
is. It's a flow of electricity. Uh

224
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
that's not exactly how the human body

225
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,440
and brain operate. Even though it's a

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,440
very complex system, even though it has

227
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
its own form of electricity, do you

228
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
visualize a future where all of us in

229
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,080
this room will actually have chips

230
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,440
implanted in our brains? All right. So

231
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,839
the brain also functions through

232
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,959
transmission of electricity. Is this the

233
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,360
basis of computer brain interfaces?

234
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,279
Partly partly. So what you have to

235
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
understand is that in the brain

236
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,200
everything is a equilibrium. Okay.

237
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,760
Everything is balanced. For every one

238
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,680
action there is a counter action. So the

239
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
brain is in a constant state of

240
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,200
awareness and then when you decide I

241
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,680
have to do this now to do this the other

242
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,240
things have to be suppressed right and

243
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,800
then you focus on this one thing. Now

244
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,959
using electrical interface it's possible

245
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
to enhance or suppress and sometimes

246
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,760
it's not just stimulation. Sometimes you

247
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,320
want to inhibit something and sometimes

248
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,640
you want to stimulate something. So one

249
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,040
of so there are three ways to do it. You

250
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,240
can do it chemically through drugs.

251
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,079
Okay. You can do it biologically for

252
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,160
from the work I do that is using stem

253
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,560
cells. You give stem cells and then you

254
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,720
stimulate parts of the brain or you

255
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,079
could do it electrically. And I think

256
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,680
the future with chips getting smaller,

257
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,160
we'll be able to enhance our ability to

258
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,959
do things. We'll become more efficient.

259
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,800
I believe it is the future. Okay. Uh

260
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:58,000
what's the first practical superpower

261
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,760
that these computer brain interfaces

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,360
will give us? because I know that

263
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:09,200
Neuralink which is Elon Musk's

264
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,959
organization uh their first game is to

265
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,519
help people who are dealing with any

266
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,440
kind of neurological issue. Once they

267
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,760
get past chapter one of their journey,

268
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,240
I'm pretty sure they're going to go into

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,480
some kind of brain enhancement or

270
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,240
ability enhancement

271
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
uh product when it comes to those

272
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,680
computer brain interfaces. So because

273
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
you're a brain surgeon, my question to

274
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,760
you is what's the first likely

275
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,720
superpower that we will gain as human

276
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,880
beings. So like you said, first is about

277
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
disease and disorders. Yes. The most

278
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,200
important thing that we see right now is

279
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,040
paralysis or stroke. You know, so when

280
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
somebody is paralyzed, half the body is

281
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,160
not moving and by using this we are

282
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,480
likely to be able to we are likely to be

283
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,800
able to give movement back. That's one

284
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,880
hope. Also there are several other

285
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,839
diseases you know uh in in adults for

286
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,480
example in dementia or Alzheimer's

287
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,800
there's a likelihood that by stimulating

288
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,160
various parts of the brain we'll be able

289
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,000
to enhance the memory and we may not be

290
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,680
able to improve their condition but we

291
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
may be able to slow down the

292
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,600
deterioration.

293
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,320
Now when it comes to uh regular people

294
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,079
who don't have a medical problem, what

295
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,279
is the the future for us? So the future

296
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,600
for us is going to be uh in the ability.

297
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,279
So each one of us first have you know

298
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
each one of us is different. Each one of

299
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,880
us has different skills like you were in

300
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,399
a class. Maybe somebody stood first.

301
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Okay. But that person may not have been

302
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,160
good in sports or somebody stood 10.

303
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,639
Maybe he was a good cricketer but he

304
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,959
couldn't paint and somebody stood maybe

305
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,959
20th who was a great painter or a

306
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,240
musician but could not be could not play

307
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,560
games or study. So each one of us is

308
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,680
different. So today the the concept of

309
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,279
what is normal is being removed and

310
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,000
people are being looked at either as

311
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,920
neurotypical or neurodeiverse. This

312
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,079
especially with relation to conditions

313
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,880
like autism and intellectual disability.

314
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,680
We are saying don't look at anybody as

315
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,600
being less than. Somebody is typical

316
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,720
like us and somebody is different or

317
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,480
exceptional like the others. So uh the

318
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,959
enhancement you know one of the things

319
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,519
that we may work on is memory. All

320
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,240
right. Uh we might be able to uh I'm not

321
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,320
saying I'm for it. Okay. But it may be

322
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,560
likely that we may be implanting chips

323
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:36,560
that may enhance our attention, focus

324
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,120
and our ability to memorize. Now, uh

325
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,959
that may not be needed today. See, times

326
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,320
have changed. When we were students, we

327
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,000
didn't have the internet, we didn't have

328
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,639
computers, we had nothing. So, we had to

329
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,800
memorize. Today, the need for me for

330
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,959
memory is not there as much. All right?

331
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,360
However, it is likely that by doing

332
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,440
this, you know, the the ability to be

333
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,720
able to take on and handle large volumes

334
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,480
of data uh may be improved. Okay, that's

335
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
that's one of the first things that that

336
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,680
people may be interested in. And I

337
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,160
believe that what is needed is a

338
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,399
combination of all of this and that the

339
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,959
traditional systems of education now,

340
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,880
the traditional systems of evaluating

341
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,680
are all going to go in the dust bin

342
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,519
soon. Okay? because you don't need the

343
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,240
many things that you were taught earlier

344
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,560
you may not need now. However, there is

345
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,440
a there's a lot of information that

346
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,600
needs to be processed to you know for

347
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,040
future disruptive technologies you know

348
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,040
for for being able to uh be able to see

349
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,519
the world differently and both will need

350
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,839
it. Those who are apparently doing well

351
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,360
in school okay and those who are

352
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,440
apparently not doing well because those

353
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,079
who are not doing well actually have a

354
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,760
different level of brilliance. Okay. And

355
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,279
that is a brilliance that changes the

356
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,279
world. The people who've changed the

357
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,519
world are not the people who stood first

358
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,040
in class. They were the people who

359
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,399
didn't do so well in class, but they

360
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,040
brought about technology that changed

361
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,839
the world. And so suddenly you're going

362
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,680
to find that uh this digital interface

363
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,399
is going to bridge the gap between the

364
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,600
two between seeing the world in its

365
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,240
wider larger context and you know seeing

366
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,320
the world in a focused context. That is

367
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,120
where the bridging will happen.

368
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,199
backbenches are more likely to do well.

369
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
They actually changed the world. You

370
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
know, I can give you a whole list of

371
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,480
some of the greatest inventions and none

372
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,480
of those people were people who were

373
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,720
No. Yeah. All of Yeah. I think I think

374
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,079
you know as much as I respect someone

375
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,839
who does well in school I think that for

376
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,240
many of them not all of them but for

377
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,279
many of them it's almost like it's a

378
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,959
lifelong uh weight that they have to

379
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,800
carry on their shoulders because they're

380
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,560
so used to doing everything perfectly

381
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,839
that it kind of at least in my

382
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,920
experience I've noticed it takes away

383
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
from their risk appetite later on in

384
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,959
life and eventually if you really want

385
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
to break out from the pack it's about

386
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,120
taking risks it's about gambling just a

387
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
little bit calculated gambles abs and

388
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,360
and there's a neuroscience to it and

389
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,800
again you know from uh so we you know we

390
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,199
like I said I treat a lot of kids with

391
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,040
autism and we do their brain scans so we

392
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,360
finding the medial temporal area these

393
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,839
are the areas responsible for memory

394
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,320
okay uh for emotions and stuff like that

395
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,399
so when we do the scans we find that in

396
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,560
kids with autism their cerebellum their

397
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,880
small brain and the medial temporal

398
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,040
areas are hyper metabolic are not

399
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,560
working as well you can see it it's a

400
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,519
color scan so you can see that it's not

401
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,199
working however what we have found is

402
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,000
that other parts of the brain are

403
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,560
working more than normal. Okay, they you

404
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,680
know they they have an ability to see

405
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,199
things that we cannot see. Okay, so

406
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
there are two parts. There is the what

407
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,759
is called the parietal occipital area.

408
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,079
The oxipital is the visual area and

409
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,720
there is the frontal area the area that

410
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,800
does the executive thinking. So these

411
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,120
people can see things you know like

412
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,920
Einstein Einstein you know is known it

413
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,480
is known that he had autism okay but he

414
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,959
he saw the way he saw light the way he

415
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,280
you know created E is equal to MC square

416
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,600
he saw things that no scientist had seen

417
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,959
before so that's what I'm saying we need

418
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,120
both and I believe that you know the

419
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,319
technology like Neuralink is going to

420
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,679
bridge that gap what if we had both I

421
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,959
mean that's my

422
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,880
Gotcha. Wow. Okay. Uh so on the other

423
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,919
end of the spectrum is the strength of

424
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,960
the backbenchos who can see society for

425
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,520
what it is not or for what it truly is.

426
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,679
That's why they're the ones who become

427
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
who more likely to become entrepreneurs.

428
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,799
Absolutely. Because what is

429
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,640
entrepreneurship? It's 0ero to one. It's

430
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,120
creating something that doesn't exist.

431
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,039
Yes. Got it. So this is the neuroscience

432
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,799
of why backbentures are more suited to

433
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,240
entrepreneurship. Absolutely. versus

434
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,880
benches who are suited for a flourishing

435
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,039
corporate career. Something like that.

436
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
One set follows the rules well, one set

437
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,360
breaks the rules. Well, the world needs

438
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,400
both. All of us lie somewhere on the

439
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,039
spectrum. Yes. Neural link is likely to

440
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,720
give everyone the strengths of both

441
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,640
sides. That's perfectly said. You put it

442
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,440
in a nutshell beautifully. Yeah. So,

443
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,240
every rich person in the 2030s is going

444
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,320
to be a superhum.

445
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,640
Yes. Maybe that's the practical truth.

446
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,880
Whoever can afford early neural link

447
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,919
will very interesting the person who

448
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,160
created Neurolink Elon Musk himself had

449
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,320
autism he had something called asperes

450
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
that's a high functioning autism and you

451
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,320
see what this man has created you know

452
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,400
when in my in the 80s when I learned

453
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,960
driving if somebody told me one day cars

454
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,760
would drive without petrol it was like

455
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,919
science fiction one man did it one man

456
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,520
did it okay he's talking of sending

457
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
missions to Mars he created neural link

458
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,919
so he himself is a classic example

459
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
of somebody who may not have been a, you

460
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,120
know, topper in his class, but see what

461
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
he's accomplished. He's a living

462
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,120
example.

463
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,760
Okay, there's an obvious kind of scary

464
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
question which is also related to cyber

465
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,280
security because we've had some cyber

466
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,559
security experts on the show and because

467
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,080
we're talking about computer brain

468
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,919
interfaces here, effectively your

469
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,679
biology will be linked to a computer

470
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,080
system. So if that computer system gets

471
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,080
hacked, does that mean that your biology

472
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,039
can also get hacked? What's your opinion

473
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,200
as a brain surgeon? All right. So, the

474
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,039
way I see uh you know neurolink and this

475
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,559
interface between the brain and the

476
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,559
computer, it's going to be

477
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,520
more things that will be done to our

478
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,000
brain rather than things being taken out

479
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,120
from our brain. So things like our

480
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,960
memory okay our

481
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,360
emotions at this point it is very

482
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,080
difficult for any form of technology to

483
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,200
extract it for the simple reason that

484
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,280
it's not located in one region okay

485
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
although they are areas focused on

486
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,240
memory but our things are spread out

487
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,360
over a a rather you know wide area and a

488
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,360
lot of these things are in the

489
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,320
subconscious a lot of the these things

490
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,160
are are abstract they are divided

491
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,039
Because the brain functions to different

492
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,160
layers. There are layers and layers of

493
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:09,440
functioning to be able to extract this

494
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,600
information. I can't see science doing

495
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,640
it right now. So right now the interface

496
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,720
is what the technology will give to the

497
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,360
brain rather than what it'll take out

498
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,840
from the brain right now. The logic of

499
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,520
this based on what you're saying is that

500
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,520
memories and personality are stored all

501
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,280
over the physical structure of the

502
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
brain. So first we're going to have to

503
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,600
find a technology that's able to scan

504
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,039
the entire brain which is a very complex

505
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,960
structure. We've not actually been able

506
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,559
to map out the whole neurological

507
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,640
pattern of any human being I believe

508
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,799
until like individual you can make out

509
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
so you can do scans you know you can do

510
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,400
there's something called functional MRI

511
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,480
scans there are something called PET CD

512
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,200
scans where you can make out which parts

513
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,600
of the brain are working when and how.

514
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
All right. But to be able to extract

515
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,400
what information is there, you know, I

516
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,320
can't see and I'm not saying it won't

517
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
happen. I mean, anything is possible

518
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,200
where that information will be

519
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,360
extractable. Gotcha. But you're saying

520
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,960
that from the computer you will be able

521
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,559
to influence the brain. Lots of things.

522
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,640
You'll be able to completely you know

523
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,400
influence the brain in many many ways.

524
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
Now there is a danger because then you

525
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,720
can have you don't know how you know

526
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,200
depending on who does it where it is

527
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,440
done you know how you're going to

528
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,520
influence at what age are you going to

529
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,880
influence you know doing it to adults is

530
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,440
one thing doing it to children is

531
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,559
another you know and then you you might

532
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,640
want to influence a entire group or

533
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,400
class of people for a particular point

534
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,320
of view. So there are potential dangers

535
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,919
in all kinds of technology. For example,

536
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,600
uh a brain okay has

537
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:48,320
got a covering brain that's called the

538
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,960
cerebral cortex which we call the cold

539
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,840
or the human brain and there is a deeper

540
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,600
brain which we call the hot brain which

541
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,120
is a more reptilian and what is called a

542
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,280
paleomian brain you know so there is a

543
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,679
hot brain inside and there is a cold

544
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,400
brain on top. So the way the nervous

545
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,559
system has evolved. So you know life

546
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,640
started on earth with as single cells

547
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,240
you know like amoeba single cells and

548
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
then those cells multiplied and then you

549
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,440
had organism in the earlier stage. Then

550
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
when it became multiple cells now these

551
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,080
cells had to be controlled. So the

552
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,200
nervous system was created. Initially it

553
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,559
was a net a neural net and it was on the

554
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,760
outside. And then as animals evolved

555
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,919
when you know when you come to the

556
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
earthworm you'll see that the ner I

557
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,960
don't know whether in school you

558
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,360
dissected the earthworm in our time we

559
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,440
had to dissect there's a spinal cord in

560
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,760
the center okay so the earthworm has

561
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,240
just one spinal cord and there's a ring

562
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,919
on top all right and now this whole

563
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,480
nervous system gradually kept on

564
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,000
evolving to become the brain now in all

565
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,640
of us all of us the lowest part of our

566
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
brain is a reptilian brain is exactly

567
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,200
like that of a lizard

568
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,360
Exactly. All right. Above that is

569
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,440
something called a paleomian brain which

570
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,159
is exactly like that of a dog or a horse

571
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,640
or a lion and above that is a human

572
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,840
brain. So we we have three layers of

573
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,600
brains. All right. when anybody whether

574
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,760
whether it's in politics or whether it's

575
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,720
in religion or whether it's nationality

576
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,000
okay in any

577
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,760
way what Hitler did or what you know any

578
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,720
leaders of the past have done

579
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:32,640
is you can actually directly reach out

580
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,600
to the lower brains in people okay

581
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,400
because the lower brain the so the

582
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,080
reptilian brain is about the moment you

583
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,559
know it does whatever it's it's only

584
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,720
about food, you know, hunger, taste,

585
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,640
living, you know, stuff like that. The

586
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,240
higher brain, the paleo has some degree

587
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
of awareness, some degree of emotion,

588
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,960
like a dog, you know, has some degree of

589
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,799
emotions and

590
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,960
stuff. Now, that has not changed in us.

591
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,400
So, deep inside us, we still have animal

592
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,280
brains. Okay? The higher brain controls

593
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,720
this.

594
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:09,200
Now it is possible by the way you

595
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,400
communicate for people to reach out to

596
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,799
others animal brains and that is what

597
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,240
leads to what is called a herd

598
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,799
mentality. That is what leads to people

599
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,720
getting together and creating problems

600
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,480
or situations or fighting amongst each

601
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,520
other on different grounds. Mob

602
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,600
mentality. The mob mentality. The mob

603
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,600
mentality is all about the reptilian the

604
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,720
mamalian brain getting hacked and that

605
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,679
cuts off the the higher brain right so

606
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,440
it's happening by words already okay

607
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,279
it's happening by language already in

608
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,000
fact they say language is human our

609
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,159
greatest asset it's also actually the

610
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,520
biggest villain because people use words

611
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,279
and language to sway entire mobs you

612
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,039
know so it's already happening okay now

613
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,279
imagine if you could do it with a

614
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,960
digital interface is how powerful that

615
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,520
would be. Okay. So, effectively the

616
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,760
reptilian brain is still a part of your

617
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,960
own human brain today. Yeah. Absolutely.

618
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,039
And through psychological conditioning

619
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,080
of different kinds that society can

620
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,159
inflict on your own human existence, you

621
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,480
can influence a human beings is

622
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,240
reptilian brain. Absolutely. And I think

623
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,320
a very practical place that we see this

624
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,919
happening is in the world of politics.

625
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,640
Yes. which is why political speeches

626
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,039
have to be extremely simple and direct.

627
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Yes. Uh you when Trump got elected for

628
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:33,760
the first time, uh communication skill

629
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,880
coaches attributed the words he chose to

630
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,799
use in his rallies as a key factor in

631
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,960
him winning votes because he said some

632
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,159
deeply offensive things and he used

633
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,240
extremely simple words. Effectively,

634
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,240
Donald Trump has hacked the reptilian

635
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,559
brains. Absolutely.

636
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,720
Um, I'm going to twist this whole

637
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,080
conversation now. Yeah. How many brain

638
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,919
surgeries have you performed?

639
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,840
Thousands. Okay. I've lost track. I

640
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,679
remember when we spoke on our first ever

641
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,360
podcast, you said that sometimes when

642
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,320
you're doing a brain surgery, you almost

643
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,640
feel like you're cutting through

644
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,679
someone's life's memories. Mhm. Because

645
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,200
sometimes when they come out of the

646
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,279
brain surgery, some memories may be

647
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
missing. No, they are missing. They are

648
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,760
missing and they don't know. They don't

649
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,200
know that it's missing. which testifies

650
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:23,760
to the fact that memories are stored all

651
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,760
over your brain. Right?

652
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,640
Um my question to you sir

653
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,960
is physically speaking where is the

654
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,679
subconscious mind and the second

655
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,520
adjacent question is is the subconscious

656
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,440
mind even a physical entity or is it a

657
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,039
theme from the world of spiritualism and

658
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,000
psychology?

659
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,600
Okay, that that's a brilliant

660
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,720
question. So what you have to understand

661
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,520
is the brain like every other part of a

662
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,000
body or like every part of nature has a

663
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,960
dual face. There's there's a god called

664
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,279
Janus who's got two heads. One head

665
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,360
looks forward, one head looks backwards.

666
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,679
That's why the month January is named

667
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,600
after Janus because in January you look

668
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,400
back at the year that went and you look

669
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,799
ahead at the year that happened. Now the

670
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,200
human brain does exactly that. There are

671
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,000
two parts of the human brain. One part

672
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,240
where it looks after itself. It is self

673
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,360
focus,

674
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,840
introspective. It is about self-s

675
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,760
survival. And there's another part that

676
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,240
integrates this with the environment,

677
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,640
with society, with family and friends.

678
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,799
So there is a part that looks in and

679
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,400
there's a part that looks out. Okay. Now

680
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,960
this happens everywhere. Each cell of

681
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,440
our body, each cell is actually looking

682
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,400
to survive in its own self. But it's

683
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,760
also looking how it will interface with

684
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,720
other cells and so every part of the our

685
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,520
body is like that but the brain in

686
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,240
particular. Now uh how how is this in

687
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,880
terms of the hardware and the software.

688
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,120
All right. So u humans have a brain that

689
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,440
is able

690
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,679
to look at the consequences of its

691
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,159
action. So when like you do something

692
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,919
you know what will be the outcome there

693
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:17,200
is what is good bad right wrong choices

694
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,240
consequences this is all what the

695
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,080
cerebral cortex or the higher brain does

696
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,720
and then like we discussed there is a

697
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,880
lower brain that deals only with food

698
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,760
hunger

699
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,600
thirst anger emotion right so there are

700
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,320
two parts the lower brain is

701
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,200
inwardlooking it is about

702
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,279
selfpreservation It's about it's it's

703
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,960
ego and more. It's pure. If you're

704
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,159
hungry, it wants food. It doesn't care

705
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
where you get the food from. If you're

706
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,880
thirsty, it wants water. So, whatever it

707
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,640
wants, it wants it and it wants it now.

708
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
All right? So, this is the inwardlooking

709
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,399
brain and there's the outward-looking

710
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,799
brain. Now if you see evolution and

711
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,679
there's a lot that have been uh written

712
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,840
on this what has happened is normally

713
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,640
when things

714
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,320
evolve whatever is

715
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,640
lower you know is controlled by whatever

716
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,840
is higher normally there's a control you

717
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,799
know for example the spinal cord is

718
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,320
under control of the lower brain if the

719
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,600
if there's an instruction given the

720
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,080
spinal cord doesn't have a choice

721
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,760
whether to trans you know if you say I

722
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,440
have to walk the spine spinal cord can't

723
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,000
say no I will not let you it'll pass

724
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,559
that signal it doesn't have a control

725
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
whereas in the brain the midbrain I'm

726
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,960
talking about the mamlian or reptilian

727
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,320
brain this

728
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,399
actually you know it may not block but

729
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,200
it there's a conflict between the two

730
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,919
all right between what

731
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,640
between logic reason and emotion you

732
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,600
know there's a constant conflict I mean

733
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,240
uh the suffering of all of mankind is

734
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,039
purely because of this the imbalance

735
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,440
between the M right suffering happens

736
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,880
when reality doesn't meet expectations.

737
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,360
Yeah, that's philosophy. So basically uh

738
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,720
reality is created by the logical mind

739
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,640
but expectations are created by the

740
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,120
emotional. Absolutely. Perfect. Okay.

741
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,279
Perfectly said. Your own reptilian brain

742
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,919
wants the world to be ideal, wants

743
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,399
everything that you wish to happen. Then

744
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,480
your higher brain processes the reality

745
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,640
of the world around you. And when those

746
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,480
two outcomes don't match, that's what

747
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,480
creates frustration for you. Yeah. Okay.

748
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,960
So that creates anger and that that very

749
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,399
often leads to almost everything

750
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,919
including you know whether it's

751
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,480
addictions or whether it is you know uh

752
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,240
behavior that is not completely correct

753
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,720
as far as society's norms go. So all of

754
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,960
this is a conflict between two brains.

755
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,640
Both of them are our brains. Okay. Uh

756
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,600
but there's a conflict between these two

757
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,679
brains. And of course the best way out

758
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,279
is something that you practice yourself

759
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,840
and that is meditation okay because

760
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,240
meditation is the only tool okay that

761
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,200
brings about harmony between the lower

762
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,279
and the higher brain it's the only tool

763
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,840
available now I am hoping that the

764
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,840
digital technology you know things like

765
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,159
neural link may may be able to do what

766
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,640
meditation does so this harmony between

767
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,960
those two brains means What biologically

768
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,200
speak let's take an addiction all right

769
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,600
I may know that alcohol is not good for

770
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,360
me or I may know that you know some

771
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,840
other you know taking other drugs is not

772
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,360
good for me but the craving for it is so

773
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,880
much your higher brain is telling you

774
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,600
it's not good okay it completely

775
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,720
overrules that right so this is all

776
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,679
basically electrical transmission and

777
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,440
neurochemicals you know that that that

778
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,039
are playing with each other right so

779
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,720
what does meditation do when you're

780
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,080
meditating what are you doing all right

781
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,760
when you're medit meditating

782
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,960
uh there is a silencing of the mind all

783
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,880
right and the brain waves so just to let

784
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,120
you know we have brain waves in us all

785
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,960
right

786
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,799
so there are different levels of brain

787
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,039
brain waves so when you're concentrating

788
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,919
on something there's actually something

789
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,279
called gamma waves okay that is when say

790
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,039
you're reading a book or you're trying

791
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,919
to study something so your gamma waves

792
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:12,080
are are there like even right now no

793
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,600
this this is different so right now we

794
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,360
are in the beta wave fame. So when

795
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,840
you're talking to somebody, see when

796
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,559
you're

797
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,760
concentrating, when you're reading a

798
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,360
book, let's say you're doing research on

799
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,760
a topic, right? That time it is gamma

800
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,679
waves. When you're talking to somebody,

801
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,679
it is beta waves. When you're giving a

802
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,080
speech or a lecture, right? Now our beta

803
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,200
waves are completely active. Okay? You

804
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,799
understand the difference between

805
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,120
concentration and and uh interaction.

806
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,919
Now let us say we took a break after

807
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,399
this and you know we just sat went out

808
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,320
for coffee. Now our alpha waves will go

809
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,519
into rhythm. So alpha waves is the

810
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,880
little more more you know little more

811
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,960
relaxed where you aren't uh you're not

812
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,000
sleeping but it is you're relaxed

813
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,600
alpha. Let's say after this you want to

814
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,440
take a nap then then you go into what is

815
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,240
called the theta wave. You know when you

816
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,679
theta wave is a wave which is you know

817
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,279
the the way you're feeling just before

818
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,039
you sleep. Okay, that's theta which by

819
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,039
the way is also the wave when you're

820
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,120
driving long distances on a highway you

821
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,440
know actually your theta waves get

822
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,159
activated that is why they're accidents

823
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,919
because you're sort of pre-sleep you

824
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,919
know if you're driving on the atal setu

825
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,600
you know after for some time you start

826
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,840
feeling actually because your theta

827
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,159
waves are activated and the last when

828
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,000
you go into sleep it is delta waves deep

829
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,880
sleep deep sleep it's delta waves deep

830
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,559
sleep now when you're meditating it's

831
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,799
your alpha and theta waves that are

832
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,399
active any form of meditation and

833
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,960
there's lot of there hundreds of papers

834
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,559
to show that so your alpha wave is the

835
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,799
wave when you are relaxing but alert see

836
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,919
the beauty of meditation it doesn't put

837
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,720
you to sleep it calms you but your mind

838
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,799
is still alert that is alpha okay and

839
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,360
the theta waves is the calming it's

840
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:04,320
silencing out you know the distractions

841
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:08,960
so the beauty of meditation is is these

842
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,720
waves okay Now again I believe that you

843
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,440
know interfacing the brain with

844
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,560
computers might be able to bring us into

845
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,639
a state.

846
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,200
you know I I know how many hours you

847
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,760
spend meditating you know I mean um uh

848
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,919
you you have a a phenomenal spiritual

849
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,560
side to you but that's not humanly

850
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,240
possible I mean for everybody to do I

851
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,919
mean you know in today's world with with

852
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,079
this you know how many people can spend

853
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,159
an hour meditating in the morning right

854
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,599
so sometimes we have to use technology

855
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,639
so this is you know I'll give you

856
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,240
another example all our diseases and our

857
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,839
problem whether it's cardiac neuro

858
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,280
everything else is primarily because of

859
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,280
lack of oxygen Okay. In our body hypoxia

860
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,919
eskemia ideally when you do pranayam

861
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,240
when you do yoga in what are you doing

862
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,639
in yoga you're deep breathing oxygen.

863
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,040
Okay. And if you do it long enough the

864
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,320
oxygen is going under pressure. Now that

865
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,400
is helping you heal and prevent disease.

866
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,720
But can everybody do pranayam for half

867
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,560
an hour 1 hour? No. So what do we do? We

868
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,440
take medical technology. We have in a

869
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,640
hospital hyperbaric oxygen chambers. You

870
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,000
must have you must be aware of

871
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,520
hyperbaric oxygen. A lot of people are

872
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
using it for anti-aging. What does

873
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,079
hyperbaric oxygen do? It pushes oxygen

874
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,839
under pressure. So in 1 hour, you know,

875
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,240
so it's easier for people to go into a

876
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,480
chamber and breathe oxygen than to do 1

877
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,400
hour of pranayam. One hour of pranayam

878
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,839
is difficult. Okay. I've tried I can't

879
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,359
do more than 15 minutes. Okay. What if

880
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,440
you do the pranayam inside the oxygen

881
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,520
chamber? I think that would be like some

882
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,839
a different level only. So have you

883
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,079
understood? Yeah. What are natural

884
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,720
systems? What our ancient traditions are

885
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,400
saying? What that pranayam is good for

886
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,119
health? People can't do it. So now we

887
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,359
using technology to do exactly what

888
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,520
pranayam is

889
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,040
doing. Ideally meditation is a tool

890
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,280
everybody should be doing. But if you

891
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,200
can't do it, what if technology did that

892
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
for you? What if you could create alpha

893
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,320
and theta waves in the brain? Got can

894
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,480
you speak a little bit more about these

895
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,960
waves? Yeah. Yeah. uh when you say that

896
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,839
the brain is vibrating in alpha or gamma

897
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,359
I am assuming that there have been

898
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,240
scientific studies where they measured

899
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,560
the outputs of the brain lots lots of

900
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,800
them hundreds of papers then categorize

901
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,640
those outputs into alpha beta gamma

902
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,240
theta and delta right uh now for the end

903
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,560
user who's listening to this podcast

904
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,520
from a practical perspective

905
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,119
uh what's your advice as a doctor alpha

906
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,160
and theta is is a relax is when you when

907
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,920
want to relax, wind down, you know, but

908
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,640
you can't go through life living in

909
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,400
alpha and theta, if you have to study,

910
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,839
okay, if you have to do a job, if you

911
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,000
have to work on a project, if somebody

912
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,680
has to do coding, when somebody's doing

913
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
coding, an IT professional, he has to be

914
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,880
in a total gamma, you know, he has to be

915
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,880
focusing on what he's doing. If he's if

916
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,960
he's trying to do a programming or if

917
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,160
let's say as a surgeon, okay, if I'm

918
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
operating on the brain, I can't be in

919
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,960
alpha and theta. I have to be in gamma.

920
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,320
That is concentrated. when I'm talking

921
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,800
let's say I'm taking a lecture for

922
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,680
students I can't be in alpha and theta I

923
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,960
have to be in beta beta okay because

924
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,520
have you understood so we need all of

925
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,200
these what happens is today's today's

926
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,599
life everybody is either concentrating

927
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,320
on doing something or in this mode and

928
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,640
so we don't we don't take the breaks for

929
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,040
alpha we don't take the the so you need

930
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,920
to have a balance of both okay that's

931
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,200
okay so

932
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,040
gamma okay so your brain concentration

933
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,480
so your brain is vibrating in the gamma

934
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,000
state when you're focused constant

935
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,800
focused focused on job. I would also

936
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,640
assume highly productive individuals are

937
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,440
able to stay in that gamma state much

938
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,000
longer. Yes. Correct. Yeah. So, so that

939
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,160
is attention. So, your front benches,

940
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,119
okay, your front benches, they are the

941
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,480
more gamma gamma because they

942
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,079
concentrate, you know. Gotcha. Is there

943
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,599
any way to improve your brain's ability

944
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:59,440
to stay in the gamma state for long? Um,

945
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,520
starting first uh sleep. Okay. because

946
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,480
they found that unless you have had 8

947
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,920
hours of full sleep, you know, your uh

948
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,520
attention concentration areas are

949
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,760
lesser. Second,

950
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,079
uh exercise again they found that if you

951
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,800
exercise regularly

952
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,320
um when you're giving attention to

953
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,000
things, you can do it better. Then diet

954
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
of course makes a big difference for

955
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,320
your ability for your brain to stay in

956
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,520
its gamma state. gamma also although

957
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,760
it's not good but things like u caffeine

958
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,480
coffee and tea will help you you know

959
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,280
focus longer alcohol will will put you

960
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,079
in a in your alpha and theta state so so

961
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,040
these things help you know um caffeine

962
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,160
actually focus helps you to uh focus

963
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,040
more on on the things that you have to

964
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,920
do

965
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,599
so then um again meditation is something

966
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
that's again very useful you know I'm

967
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,960
going keep coming to meditation because

968
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,800
there is nothing better than meditation

969
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,000
for actually all of these things you

970
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,800
know and um like they say that when you

971
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,720
are completely focused on a job when

972
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,040
you're completely into it you sort of

973
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,200
get into that uh you can it can become

974
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,880
for you a meditative state as well you

975
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,200
know when you're when you're you're not

976
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,680
doing it as a job when you're completely

977
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,359
en when it's it's just a part of you

978
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
when you and your work become one you

979
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,880
know it's not something you are doing I

980
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,640
I like to put it like that. Your head,

981
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,200
your heart, and your hands are all in

982
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,280
sync. The three H's. Wow. Okay. What a

983
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,119
fascinating conversation.

984
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,040
Okay. I have to go back to the

985
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,960
subconscious mind. How do you explain

986
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,720
the subconscious mind to a 5-year-old?

987
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,560
What is it in the first place? Because

988
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,079
I've actually had 10 different people

989
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,359
give me 10 different explanations on the

990
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,920
show, but I would like to hear the brain

991
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,640
surgeon talking about the subconscious

992
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,560
mind. All

993
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,800
right.

994
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:55,359
So again there are layers in the

995
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,839
brain. What is the conscious mind? Okay

996
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,079
the conscious

997
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:03,599
mind does the following activities. The

998
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,079
first the conscious mind has memory.

999
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,640
Second the conscious mind has

1000
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,040
intelligence the ability to you know do

1001
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,359
things. Third the conscious mind

1002
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,280
controls body movements. All right.

1003
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,240
Okay. If I had to give a simple example,

1004
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,880
if the conscious mind is a is a is on

1005
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,640
the stage, a play that is happening or a

1006
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,320
music concert, whatever is happening at

1007
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,320
the back of the stage is the

1008
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,520
subconscious mind. So there is a lot

1009
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,599
happening in the background that is

1010
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,480
letting you do all these things which

1011
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,040
that your conscious mind is doing. All

1012
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,960
right?

1013
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,200
Now in the subconscious mind, what all

1014
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,680
is there? So there is a huge lot of

1015
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,119
data. Okay. Now this data is of

1016
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,680
everything that has happened in the

1017
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,599
past. Okay. So whatever has happened in

1018
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,520
childhood you know everything that has

1019
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,960
happened in

1020
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,480
particular relationship with the parents

1021
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,960
they found that you know our

1022
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,200
relationship with our parents is one of

1023
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,760
the fundamental programming of our

1024
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,240
subconscious brain. Okay. And uh then

1025
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,440
all the events, the hurts, the pains,

1026
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,680
the traumas, the joys and the sorrows,

1027
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,599
they are all in the subconscious mind.

1028
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,800
They at the back. You don't see them

1029
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,359
every day, but they are there. And they

1030
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,520
are influencing what is happening to

1031
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,359
your to your conscious mind. So your

1032
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,599
conscious mind right now whatever you're

1033
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,400
thinking you know our conscious mind is

1034
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,680
active but at the back end there is a

1035
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,960
huge lot of data which is which is now

1036
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,200
controlling what is happening in the

1037
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,960
front end. All right. Now, this is the

1038
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,319
psychology based explanation, right?

1039
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,200
This is the psychology. Now, there's the

1040
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,280
neuros the neuroscience-based

1041
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,240
explanation. So, now when do you see

1042
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,359
when do you get to see your

1043
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,960
subconscious? Uh it's like it's

1044
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,359
difficult to see your subconscious. But

1045
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,359
the time when you really get a sense of

1046
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,839
it is in dreams. Okay? Because in your

1047
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,319
dreams a lot of your subconscious starts

1048
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,000
playing up. Now, with regard to dreams,

1049
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,160
there are two views. There was the old

1050
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,720
Freuden view which actually looks at it

1051
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,119
as just repressed emotions and you know

1052
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,760
it's a more psychological view but today

1053
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,480
there is a more neuroscience view a

1054
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,680
neuroscience perspective to what is

1055
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,560
happening in our dreams. So basically in

1056
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,800
in our daytime I mean in our awake time

1057
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,240
sorry not daytime you know the brain is

1058
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,079
working there's so much happening there

1059
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,000
is there is emotions there is

1060
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,160
interaction there is changes there is

1061
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,480
there is a lot of stuff happening now

1062
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,480
uh in the night when you sleep

1063
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,359
housekeeping needs to be done because

1064
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,680
you know whatever's happened in the day

1065
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,640
uh the subconscious mind actually takes

1066
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,240
all that and stacks it stores it there

1067
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,440
are different parts of the brain And you

1068
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,960
know there is there's something called

1069
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,520
the hippocampus which uh you know it's

1070
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,800
like a seahorse shape which stacks

1071
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,319
memory you know literally shells the

1072
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,880
memory. There's the amydala that's

1073
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:08,160
concerned with raw emotions and fear and

1074
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,079
everything else. U there is so there's

1075
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,760
the hypothalamus that controls the

1076
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,760
pituitary gland that is you know

1077
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,960
concerned with a lot of our emotional

1078
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,040
stuff. This whole thing is called the

1079
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:22,880
lyic system.

1080
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:25,200
So what is happening is in the night all

1081
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,880
that is getting sorted. Okay. Through

1082
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,640
the day your limbic system is getting

1083
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,839
overloaded just through your experiences

1084
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,240
of the day. Yeah. Yeah. Now in the night

1085
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,960
a lot of this has to be either got rid

1086
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,520
of or it has to be stored because in the

1087
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,000
night the brain has deleted that. Okay.

1088
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,400
And um so what happens in the night

1089
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,560
again uh sleep has got two parts. There

1090
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,640
is uh I I did a podcast with you on

1091
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,800
sleep. There is the nonm part and there

1092
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,280
is them part. So

1093
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,520
uh both have dreams but it's them sleep

1094
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,079
the dreams and them sleep you know which

1095
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,040
are which is what we remember you know

1096
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,280
which again the key part of the

1097
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,680
subconscious is actually the emotional

1098
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,520
content. So if you see your dreams

1099
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,119
you'll notice they always emotionally

1100
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,400
charged. There is always some emotion

1101
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,400
tag to it. You know, also our dreams are

1102
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,640
more visual, less sound. You know,

1103
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,640
you'll actually see images. You'll you

1104
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,119
know, it's it's things in motion and but

1105
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,440
there's always an emotion, right? And of

1106
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,440
course, now dreams is a separate topic

1107
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,280
all by itself what it means. Okay. Can I

1108
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,280
have a go at it until this point just to

1109
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,880
be sure that I'm with you? Yeah. Uh so

1110
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,200
effectively, you go through experiences

1111
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,800
throughout your life, but also every

1112
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,280
single day. Now all that is cumulatively

1113
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,319
stored in what we theoretically call the

1114
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,040
subconscious mind. The subconscious mind

1115
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,920
originally is a theory from the world of

1116
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,520
psychology. Yes, it's basically what

1117
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,119
goes into forming your own human

1118
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,640
personality and character and it's

1119
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,480
heavily dependent on your relationship

1120
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,760
with your parents, all your life's

1121
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,240
experiences, etc. So you'll hear a lot

1122
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,920
of modernday psychologists and life

1123
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,000
coaches saying, "Hey, program your

1124
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,960
subconscious mind." I think what they're

1125
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,680
effectively trying to do is feed in

1126
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,440
positive memory, feed in positive data,

1127
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,599
feed in positive content so that um in

1128
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,800
that scrambled egg of memories that

1129
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,440
you're making, you put in something

1130
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,040
tasty, something tastier because

1131
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,040
eventually whatever goes on in your

1132
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,880
subconscious mind will determine the

1133
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,280
actions of your conscious mind.

1134
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,760
Absolutely. Very well said. the ability

1135
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,760
to work hard or go for that big business

1136
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,240
that you wanted to open or take that

1137
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,920
risk in life or ask out that girl. Those

1138
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,680
are decisions of your conscious mind

1139
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,200
which are affected heavily by all your

1140
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,839
memories, your parental relationship,

1141
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,960
the content you're watching, etc., etc.

1142
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,599
But in terms of the biology, as of now,

1143
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,920
we know that yes, the lyic system

1144
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,079
heavily contributes to affecting your

1145
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,800
subconscious mind daily through its

1146
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,880
emotions. through its emotions

1147
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,800
and every single day your lyic system is

1148
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,720
getting highly stimulated. When you

1149
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,680
sleep well at night, your lyic system

1150
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,920
processes all this and showcases it to

1151
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,720
your conscious brain as emotionally

1152
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,040
charged dreams. Absolutely. Effectively

1153
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,319
coming back to the subconscious mind, I

1154
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,160
don't think we fully understood the

1155
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,119
physical nature of the subconscious mind

1156
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,400
yet. No. So the subconscious mind is not

1157
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,440
in a spot like see our speech area. I

1158
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,359
can say there's something called the

1159
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,680
broka speech area. It's in the left side

1160
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:35,960
of the brain. So you can say speech area

1161
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,880
one part right uh the you know our our

1162
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,800
say visual area is the occipital lobe.

1163
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,560
You can say oxipital lobe there. All

1164
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,599
right. The subconscious mind derives it

1165
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,760
data or stores it data in all of this.

1166
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,760
Okay. So you can't isolate you can't

1167
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,240
take a spot and say this is the

1168
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,960
subconscious mind. I mean in other words

1169
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,800
there is no anatomical location for the

1170
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,640
subconscious mind. There is an

1171
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,800
anatomical location for other things

1172
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,280
like our executive decision making our

1173
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,520
intelligence is in the frontal lobe. Our

1174
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,599
sensations are in the parietital lobe.

1175
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,760
Uh below that is the the phalamus which

1176
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,960
is also a sensory relay station. So all

1177
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,880
sensations go through through that. Uh

1178
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,359
so basically all our sensations go

1179
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,920
through a sensory relay station called

1180
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,400
the the phalamus which then sends it to

1181
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,640
the brain. All except smell. That's why

1182
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,480
smell is a very powerful smell. Smell is

1183
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,760
the only sensation that bypasses the

1184
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,520
thealamus and goes straight to the

1185
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,359
brain. So smell is a very very powerful

1186
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,040
sensation that is completely ignored in

1187
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,560
neuroscience but it's very powerful.

1188
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,560
That's why perfumes play a love and

1189
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:44,560
romance. Uh yes play a big role. Uh the

1190
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,240
practical question for you sir is how

1191
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,880
does one program the subconscious mind

1192
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,319
according to you know so the

1193
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,160
subconscious mind gets programmed by

1194
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,200
what is what has happened in the

1195
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,440
conscious mind. So you can't get into

1196
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,520
the subconscious mind and program it.

1197
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,160
You can see that the inputs to the

1198
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,319
subconscious mind through your conscious

1199
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,000
mind are appropriate which you just

1200
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:11,119
said. So if you're going to have happy

1201
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,640
experiences, if you're going to look at

1202
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,760
you know everything from the positive

1203
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,280
side of life all right then over a

1204
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,920
period of time those things will go into

1205
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,200
your subconscious. So the subconscious

1206
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:28,079
gets it gets its feed from the conscious

1207
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,760
but it gets stored there for a long time

1208
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,200
without you even knowing. So right now

1209
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,640
we are only aware of what's happening in

1210
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,960
your conscious mind. You're not aware

1211
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,400
because the subconscious mind has got

1212
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,559
data stored from since you were a kid.

1213
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,599
You know my response to the same

1214
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,839
question is that this is the actual

1215
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,280
biology behind hey you're an average of

1216
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,520
the five people you hang out with the

1217
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,920
most. Absolutely. Or hey your parents'

1218
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,760
personality reflects in your own nature

1219
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,800
or hey you are an outcome of the content

1220
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,400
you consume. Yes. This is completely all

1221
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,960
these aspects of life program your

1222
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,800
subconscious mind into operating your

1223
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,359
conscious mind and taking your life to

1224
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,960
where it's meant to go. Okay. So

1225
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,640
obviously if you watch a lot of

1226
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,480
motivational content, if you watch a lot

1227
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,480
of content around growth, that's who

1228
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,040
you'll

1229
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:19,599
become. And if you watch content that's

1230
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,880
simply based on entertainment, perhaps

1231
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,440
it has its place in life. But if it's

1232
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,200
empty entertainment all the time, it

1233
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,800
probably leads to some kind of emptiness

1234
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,319
in terms of your conscious mind's

1235
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,839
actions perhaps.

1236
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,440
No, it's very true. I'll just give you

1237
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,920
example. So when we were in school, we

1238
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,200
had no environmental sciences. Like when

1239
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,680
we studied, I think when you were in

1240
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,559
school, you had EBS, right? So there is

1241
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,559
a big difference between my approach to

1242
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,640
the environment and my daughter's. Okay.

1243
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,599
She is so conscious about everything

1244
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,040
environmental and we are not conscious

1245
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,280
at all because in school we never

1246
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,520
studied it. So in our subconscious there

1247
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,400
is no environment consciousness. All

1248
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,000
right. Whereas in your generation it is

1249
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,760
it's because you were taught that at

1250
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,440
school. All right. Another another

1251
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,359
surface level example of this exact

1252
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,960
thing. We had Suma Garwal ma'am who's

1253
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,200
one of the country's top nutritionists.

1254
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,160
She said that uh the country that deals

1255
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,599
with the least number of obesity issues

1256
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,119
is Japan and the corollary is that

1257
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,559
Japanese students are put through a

1258
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,720
nutrition course in their first and

1259
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,480
secondary.

1260
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,720
All school includes nutrition as a core

1261
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,319
concept. So that's all the subconscious

1262
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,400
programming.

1263
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:36,079
Okay. So the answer to your question is

1264
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,160
you can't reach the subconscious

1265
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,400
directly. You have to get to it through

1266
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,400
your conscious. I think this is perhaps

1267
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,559
the most important parenting lesson out

1268
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,240
there as well that you can literally

1269
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,680
program your kid into being a Taipei

1270
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,079
personality. Absolutely. Okay, heading

1271
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,880
into the final section of the episode,

1272
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:57,760
the climax, which is the internet's

1273
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,920
all-time hottest topic,

1274
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,640
emotions,

1275
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:09,119
especially during a period of human kind

1276
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:11,520
where emotional instability is the norm.

1277
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,359
While people say that yes, mental health

1278
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,319
was an issue even in the '90s, we just

1279
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,480
didn't call it out. I do think that the

1280
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:21,440
nature of urban society in the modern

1281
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,800
day and from a neuroscience perspective,

1282
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:28,000
the way uh dopamine systems are a little

1283
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,559
messed up in the modern day lead to

1284
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,559
mental health issues and emotional

1285
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:37,040
instability. Mhm. Now starting from

1286
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,319
these kind of basics, can we take the

1287
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,720
conversation right up till what the

1288
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,119
future of

1289
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:48,280
emotions is for mankind once computer

1290
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,800
brain interfaces become a thing.

1291
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,240
Um in the last section we spoke about

1292
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,760
the subconscious mind. So I think the

1293
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,319
audience has loosely understood the

1294
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,720
subconscious mind. My question to you

1295
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,720
first and foremost sir is what are

1296
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,720
emotions?

1297
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,640
So

1298
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,960
emotions is a subset of the functioning

1299
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,160
of the brain. So just like there is

1300
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,440
memory which is stored there are there

1301
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:18,400
is cognition or intellectual functioning

1302
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,200
or executive actions there is also

1303
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,000
emotions. The thing about emotions is

1304
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,480
that there is a feeling attached to it.

1305
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,079
Normally you know I mean people in

1306
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,000
general talk of emotions as being

1307
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,960
connected to the heart but the heart

1308
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,359
really has no emotions. All the emotions

1309
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,680
are are in the lyic system. However they

1310
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,760
are connected to what is happening in

1311
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,839
the higher brain.

1312
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,079
Now love is of different types and

1313
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,920
according to me there is only one real

1314
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:55,119
love on the planet and that

1315
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,000
is that of a mother for her child and

1316
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,440
the reason for that is that it is

1317
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,720
unconditional. Okay, not father to

1318
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,640
child. It is you know mother to child is

1319
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,440
a very different fathers love their kids

1320
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,079
as much but a mother having kept the

1321
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,920
child in the womb for 9 months has a

1322
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,520
very different subconscious acceptance

1323
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,839
of the child. The difference between a

1324
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,240
father's love and a mother's love is a

1325
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:22,480
mother's love is

1326
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,440
unconditional. Father's love is as much

1327
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,359
but there are

1328
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:29,200
expectations. You know mothers tend to

1329
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,119
have less they you know and and I see

1330
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,280
this all the time because I deal with

1331
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:36,240
children with autism. These are children

1332
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,920
who cannot speak. These are children who

1333
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,079
cannot read and write, who cannot go to

1334
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,520
school, who have hyperactive behavior.

1335
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,079
They have head banging. They have all

1336
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:48,319
kinds of things. And I've seen the

1337
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:51,280
unconditionality of that love is a

1338
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:53,319
different level. Right? So the

1339
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,520
definition of love is its

1340
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:57,440
unconditionality. Everything else is

1341
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,839
conditional. All right? There is a give

1342
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,200
and there is a take. So you know it may

1343
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:04,440
not be said but it is implied in every

1344
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,640
other

1345
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,920
relationship. Now when it comes to

1346
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,920
emotions I'll start there. There are

1347
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,520
different levels of emotions again. So I

1348
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,559
I will deal with the most fundamental

1349
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,559
one that is that between a man and a

1350
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,680
woman or between a boy and a girl or

1351
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,760
emotional love or romantic love or a

1352
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,280
relationship. I was just classifying it.

1353
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:29,280
So this is one. The second is financial.

1354
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,319
Okay, people have money don't have

1355
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,559
money. The third is success. People have

1356
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,440
success, people don't have success. So

1357
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,520
there are different situations which are

1358
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,960
emotionally connected. So romantic

1359
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:47,000
relationships are money is work is and

1360
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,720
all of this leads to sadness or

1361
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,000
happiness. Now the thing is in the brain

1362
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:56,240
itself there is an area that's that is

1363
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,079
referred to as the pleasure area and

1364
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,920
there's another area which is called the

1365
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,880
pain area but it's actually not a pain

1366
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,200
area it's an unpleasure area and these

1367
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,800
can be stimulated even animals have it.

1368
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,160
So a famous Russian scientist Pavlov he

1369
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,040
actually stimulated you can put an

1370
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,200
electrode into a rat's pleasure area and

1371
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,760
the rat will you know continue wanting

1372
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,920
that to the extent of not taking food

1373
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,760
you know and for the pain here he will

1374
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,960
do the exact opposite. So we actually

1375
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,240
have areas in the brain that get

1376
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,400
triggered by various things. So there's

1377
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,319
a electrical trigger. There are also

1378
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,040
chemical triggers. There is dopamine,

1379
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,720
there is serotinine, there is

1380
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,720
acetylcholine, there is non-epinephrine,

1381
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,319
there histamine. There are various uh

1382
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,280
neurochemicals in the brain that are

1383
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:43,280
also responsible for this.

1384
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,040
Now why are people unhappy? Okay,

1385
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,760
fundamentally what is it that makes

1386
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,359
people unhappy? And so there, you know,

1387
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,400
I could divide them into just a couple

1388
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,520
of reasons. And in fact addiction has to

1389
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,760
do with this because when you take

1390
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,520
addicting when you take things that

1391
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,280
cause

1392
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:02,240
addiction those chemicals and agents go

1393
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,720
and stick to those areas of the brain.

1394
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,480
Now the brain cannot get stimulated by

1395
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,799
anything else. The pleasure area only

1396
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,599
gets stimulated by the things you are

1397
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,520
addicted to.

1398
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,760
So that explains addiction because you

1399
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,319
know when the pleasure areas are now

1400
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,000
only only one thing is taken control

1401
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,160
over them now nothing else gives you

1402
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,760
pleasure and that that is the cause for

1403
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,480
addiction. So in other words in the

1404
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,480
brain they are these two areas. So

1405
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:31,599
happiness is actually neurochemistry

1406
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,680
okay and uh I mean it's uh yeah so

1407
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,599
neurobiology and neurochemistry both

1408
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,520
combine like how would you explain

1409
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:41,839
happiness to something that's never felt

1410
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:44,799
emotions? Okay. No. So when this area is

1411
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:47,440
uh is triggered and it has dopamine is a

1412
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,200
very important part of that you just

1413
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,280
have a feel you know there is this feel

1414
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,319
there's this feel good you know there

1415
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,400
you know there are times when things

1416
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,079
happen you just feel good it may happen

1417
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,920
that you've done a great podcast so you

1418
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,119
just feel good after that and there may

1419
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,200
be times you've done a podcast and

1420
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,359
you're not feeling so good you know so

1421
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,920
there is a part of the brain that gets

1422
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:08,079
triggered now different things uh

1423
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,720
different events different circumstances

1424
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,440
different people actually trigger your

1425
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,400
pleasure areas and conversely the

1426
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,400
opposite. Right? So for the brain, by

1427
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,400
the way, they are the same. The brain

1428
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,000
does not make a distinction between the

1429
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,880
pleasure and the pain areas. For them,

1430
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,160
it's just two parts. Okay? We are the

1431
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,799
ones that either feel good or don't feel

1432
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,319
good. All right? So that that is the

1433
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,559
distinction.

1434
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,799
But the fundamental you know if when you

1435
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,760
analyze it from a neurobiological point

1436
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:46,119
of view why is it that people are

1437
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:49,119
unhappy. Okay. So one of the reasons is

1438
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:51,680
that our brain because of what is

1439
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,680
happening in the subconscious mind

1440
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,720
doesn't remain in the present moment.

1441
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,720
Okay. It is either you know because of

1442
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,880
what has happened in the past. Either

1443
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,359
there is a constant triggering of things

1444
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,079
from the past that make you unhappy and

1445
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,599
trigger the unpleasure areas. Okay. Or

1446
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,680
there are fears about what will happen

1447
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,520
in the future which are also connected

1448
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:16,400
to what has happened in the past you

1449
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:19,280
know and uh so lower animals actually uh

1450
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,359
who don't have have a complicated brain

1451
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,359
like ours are in the moment. They just

1452
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,799
live in the moment. Okay. There is no

1453
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,440
past for them. there's no future for

1454
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:30,160
them. So one of the problems of

1455
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,400
humankind is that our brain doesn't let

1456
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,480
us be still in the moment. You know it's

1457
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,799
always living in the past or the present

1458
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,280
again because of the subconscious not

1459
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:41,839
the conscious past and the future. Yeah.

1460
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,680
Again it's the subconscious which is now

1461
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,240
you know not letting your conscious mind

1462
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,319
be in this

1463
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:51,920
moment. That is reason one. Uh the

1464
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:54,480
reason two is a constant gap between

1465
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,240
what you have and what you want. So

1466
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,760
humankind there is a constant you know

1467
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,000
you you want something and you don't

1468
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,880
have it and so you're unhappy. Now this

1469
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,040
this could be material possessions, it

1470
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,000
could be things that you do, it could be

1471
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,839
emotional pursuits, it could be

1472
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,319
whatever. And then I often ask myself if

1473
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:17,440
it was if it was that simple then when

1474
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:19,440
you get it you should be happy, right? I

1475
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,040
mean so and then I realized that what

1476
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,960
happens is that the goalpost keeps

1477
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,079
shifting. M so a person who doesn't have

1478
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,240
a car might be happy with a simple small

1479
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,839
car you know the problem is when he gets

1480
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,319
the small car he's now looking at the

1481
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:34,079
midsize car okay and when he gets the

1482
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:36,559
midsize car he's looking for a high-end

1483
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,240
car and when he looking when he has the

1484
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,760
high-end car he's looking for something

1485
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:45,200
even better and I remember Osho you know

1486
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,720
Rajni when he he was spiritual guru but

1487
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,960
when he died I believe he had some 80

1488
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,280
plus Rolls-Royce cars because his dream

1489
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,280
was to have one Rolls-Royce car for

1490
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,760
every day of the year and then I

1491
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,319
realized that well if a guru was not

1492
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,839
happy with 80 rulas

1493
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:03,599
uh then obviously you know a materi

1494
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:05,839
material possessions this trying to

1495
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:08,160
bridge this gap doesn't work the other

1496
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:10,559
thing is spirituality and meditation

1497
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,920
which says accept what you have that's

1498
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,079
the other side whatever you have you

1499
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,079
accept it well that's easier said than

1500
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,559
done in today's world because today's

1501
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,760
world is a materialistic world I I have

1502
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,359
a bit of a philosophical interjection

1503
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:28,160
So there's a story about someone who

1504
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:30,720
went up to the Buddha and said, "Buddha,

1505
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,599
I want happiness." So the Buddha

1506
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,599
responds by saying, "Remove the eye and

1507
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,440
you've removed ego. Remove the want and

1508
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,839
you've removed desire. What you're left

1509
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,680
with is happiness." And this is

1510
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,720
effectively the philosophy behind the

1511
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,160
neuroscience you just explained. Mhm.

1512
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,839
Yeah. And uh but I have a simple

1513
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,520
solution for that, you I mean a simple

1514
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,280
solution in the so there is the

1515
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,040
spiritual side there's the emotional

1516
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,040
side and there is the material side

1517
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,720
right so I did something interesting

1518
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,559
what I did was when I realized that

1519
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,680
there is no end that you no matter what

1520
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,160
you have you are still going to be

1521
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,079
unhappy uh I did something interesting

1522
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,119
many years ago

1523
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,400
um couple of decades I

1524
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:10,960
actually you know people look at life

1525
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,640
ahead what I did is I went to the end of

1526
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:16,960
my life you know I said I I reached a

1527
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,280
point where I said now the time when I

1528
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,240
part from my body and then I look

1529
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,920
backwards at my life and I said okay at

1530
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:28,880
that point when it is time to leave this

1531
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:33,119
body what all should I have been done

1532
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,960
and had that at that point I can leave

1533
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,359
stating that you know feeling that I

1534
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,960
lived a complete life and I actually sat

1535
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:41,599
down I took a piece of paper and write

1536
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,599
down you know it's amazing that list is

1537
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,720
almost three you know one by one those

1538
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,920
things are just happening you know I I I

1539
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,920
put it down on a paper. I've never

1540
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,160
looked at that paper again. All right.

1541
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:55,920
So, I decided that now I'm not going to

1542
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,520
be craving for anything more. Yeah. I'm

1543
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,000
just going to I've already decided this

1544
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,200
is what I want. And it's a one time

1545
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,839
thing. You know, you do it one time and

1546
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:08,960
you let it go. Uh it gives surprisingly

1547
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:10,720
it it gives you a very tranquil kind of

1548
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,880
no wanting anything more in your life

1549
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,200
feeling. Yeah. Let's speak about

1550
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,400
tranquility a little bit. Yeah. Coming

1551
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,400
back to what you said uh about happiness

1552
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,079
and sadness and the different parts of

1553
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,359
your brain that are stimulated by either

1554
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:28,319
of the two. Yeah.

1555
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:30,640
Does there exist neuroscience related to

1556
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,440
manipulating those two regions? Because

1557
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,280
I would also assume that too much

1558
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,839
happiness is also not good. So the

1559
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,760
pleasure and the pain areas they are

1560
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:42,240
separate. They about feel good. All

1561
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,480
right. Now the tranquility you're

1562
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:47,079
talking about is all about balance.

1563
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,720
Okay. So in our body we so the brain has

1564
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:52,160
neurotransmitters for example there's

1565
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:54,880
acetylcholine and there's norin nephrine

1566
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,400
you know one that stimulates you that is

1567
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,960
responsible for the fight and flight

1568
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,440
reflex one that calms you down. All

1569
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,119
right for every chemical in the body

1570
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,920
there is one which does the exact

1571
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,720
opposite. And tranquility is all about

1572
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:11,359
balance. The universe is all about

1573
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,760
balance. You know nature if you see is

1574
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,680
about balance. You know the earth moves

1575
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,599
around the sun and the moon moves around

1576
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,520
the earth in beautiful harmonious

1577
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:23,039
balance. The tides are in a state of

1578
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:25,599
balance. In our body our our chemistry

1579
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,440
our hormones our our muscles for every

1580
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:31,000
if your biceps does one thing there's a

1581
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:34,160
tricep that does the exact opposite. So

1582
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:37,760
tranquility is not about more or less it

1583
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:40,880
is about balance. Okay. of having the

1584
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,720
right amount of everything. So you're

1585
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,200
right, just stimulating the pleasure

1586
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:48,160
area also can lead to a complete

1587
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,760
different state of mind. Okay. It can

1588
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,480
you know you can actually become manic

1589
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,319
with with uh a whole lot of that that

1590
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,240
feeling. It's it leads to a hedonistic

1591
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,520
lifestyle. Exactly. So it's just

1592
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,000
balance. Everything needs to be

1593
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,839
balanced. And once you get that life is

1594
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,400
got to be a state of balance. The word

1595
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:06,640
that I use for you equity is a very nice

1596
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,119
word which is all about balancing out

1597
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:13,039
everything. You know once you do that

1598
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:15,680
and you respond to situations in life

1599
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,720
the way they are and not the way you

1600
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:21,359
expect them to be. All right? You accept

1601
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,920
people the way they are and not the way

1602
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:26,319
you want them or not want them to be.

1603
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,480
You take circumstances in life the way

1604
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:31,520
they've happened not the way you would

1605
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,880
want it to happen. This kind of equity

1606
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:37,599
or tranquility or balance which is cons

1607
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,079
which is directly connected to the

1608
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,160
neurotransmitters in the brain directly

1609
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,039
connected to our neurochemistry. This

1610
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,799
happens. Okay. A hedonistic lifestyle is

1611
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:51,359
one where the human body is constantly

1612
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:54,880
chasing one or more kinds of pleasures.

1613
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:57,480
For example, addiction to intoxicants

1614
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,160
addiction.

1615
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,000
um constantly buying new expensive

1616
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,440
things like being a shopahholic.

1617
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,799
Effectively, what you're doing is that

1618
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,760
you're stimulating your own dopamine

1619
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,960
systems. You're looking for quick

1620
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,839
dopamine. Effectively, another form of

1621
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,280
hedonism is just doom scrolling. You

1622
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,039
know, constantly going through short

1623
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,520
content. It's constantly secretreting

1624
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,680
dopamine in your head. But the long-term

1625
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,039
output of having a hedonistic lifestyle

1626
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,440
is that you're wrecking your dopamine

1627
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,920
systems. Right. In in short, can you

1628
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,920
explain how one is spoiling their

1629
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:32,160
dopamine systems by being honestic?

1630
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,680
Yeah. So again, uh because there is lack

1631
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:37,680
of balance now. All right.

1632
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:40,880
Uh you are there there are many things

1633
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:43,920
in your life. Okay. which would actually

1634
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:46,240
give you tranquility balance like

1635
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,640
concentration on your own health like

1636
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:51,599
concentration on relationships like

1637
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:53,839
concentrating on uh a harmonious work

1638
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,920
life balance that will go completely out

1639
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:58,240
of twist when the you know when there's

1640
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,240
an imbalance you're doing too much of

1641
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,440
see it's like this I'll explain to you

1642
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,119
like in there's a disease called

1643
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,720
Parkinson's disease okay now there are

1644
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,359
two chemicals there acetylcholine and

1645
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,920
dopamine now what happens in the disease

1646
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:12,079
is the dopamine levels fall but the

1647
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,960
dopamine levels falling don't create a

1648
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:18,559
problem it's when they fall the normal

1649
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,319
level of choline causes symptoms okay

1650
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,160
did you understand yes so something

1651
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,240
falls one more thing that falling causes

1652
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,160
the problems it's not that falling is

1653
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,079
the normal level of what was balancing

1654
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,839
out this is what people call hormonal

1655
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,720
balance exactly yeah so anything in

1656
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:38,480
excess anything will cause an imbalance

1657
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,960
in the neurochemistry of of a of a of

1658
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,680
our brain. It'll cause imbalance in

1659
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,160
electrical circuitry of the brain. It'll

1660
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:49,359
cause an imbalance between the conscious

1661
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:52,079
and the subconscious mind. And then uh

1662
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:54,000
you are in a state where you are just

1663
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,839
not feeling good. You may have

1664
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,920
everything in the world and still you're

1665
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,920
not feeling good about life. Gotcha. So

1666
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,200
effectively what I'm gaining as the

1667
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,799
bottom line output in order to chase

1668
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:09,440
tranquility and not just constant

1669
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:11,839
happiness is that you need to make life

1670
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,240
a little bit difficult for yourself in

1671
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:15,440
some

1672
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,880
aspects. Perhaps it's another way of

1673
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,880
saying challenge is a must throughout

1674
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,680
the course of life. Throughout the

1675
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,760
course of life now and if external

1676
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,520
challenges don't exist you create the

1677
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,039
challenges for yourself.

1678
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,119
Very well said. Could be as simple as

1679
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,520
sticking to your exercise routine,

1680
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,200
sleeping on time, meditating every day,

1681
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,000
something that seems difficult, actually

1682
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:41,119
adopting that into your own life. Is

1683
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,520
that a neuroscience-based hack to chase

1684
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,880
tranquility? Absolutely. Okay. Now, can

1685
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,480
you explain the neuroscience of what

1686
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:50,079
happens when you invite

1687
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,760
these good for you challenges into your

1688
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,920
life?

1689
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,599
So the moment you invite challenges

1690
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,839
you're again the balance between

1691
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,119
acetyloline and nonoprine you actually

1692
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:03,520
the moment you invite a challenge you're

1693
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:05,599
putting you know if everything is going

1694
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,680
good for you now there is no challenge

1695
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,640
in your life so your non-epinephrine

1696
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,480
levels aren't high moment you bring a

1697
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:14,720
challenge you're stimulating this okay

1698
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,000
norepinephrine norepinephrine all right

1699
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:20,960
now in our in our nervous system there

1700
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,600
is also a a part of a nerve nervous

1701
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,440
system that some people refer to as the

1702
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,279
subconscious but is actually referred to

1703
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:30,960
as the autonomic nervous system. So

1704
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,799
there is a nervous system which we have

1705
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,199
control over. There's a autonomic

1706
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,799
nervous system which runs the body like

1707
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,640
which controls your heart rate which

1708
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,839
controls your digestive movements which

1709
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,000
a lot of things are happening in your

1710
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:43,600
body which you directly can't control.

1711
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,120
Yogics can do it you know because they

1712
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,319
have control over the autonomic nervous

1713
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,040
system but we can't control our

1714
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:52,000
autonomic nervous system. Now autonomic

1715
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,960
nervous system consists of two parts.

1716
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,880
There is something called the

1717
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,400
sympathetic nervous system and there is

1718
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,480
something called the parasympathetic

1719
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,480
nervous system. Now the sympathetic

1720
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,520
nervous system has been given by nature

1721
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,920
to us to do what is called the fight and

1722
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,159
flight reflex. So when the lion is

1723
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,600
chasing a deer the deer has to run for

1724
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:11,040
life. So at that time what needs to

1725
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,359
happen? Your blood pressure needs to go

1726
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,679
up. Your heart rate has to go up. Your

1727
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,440
pupils have to be

1728
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:20,480
dilated. Uh you need more energy. So you

1729
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:22,719
need more sugar. Okay. And uh at that

1730
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,560
time you can't pass stools. So your you

1731
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,600
know your your bowel movements are shut

1732
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:29,839
down. This is controlled by the

1733
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,239
sympathetic nervous system. What it does

1734
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:34,759
it it extracts everything from the body

1735
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:36,880
to be able to save your life at that

1736
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:38,560
time. There is another system the

1737
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,880
parasympathetic nervous system which

1738
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,560
does the exact opposite. It lowers the

1739
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,799
blood pressure. It calms you down. It

1740
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,759
lowers your heart rate. It it converts

1741
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:50,679
glucon back you know. uh reduces those

1742
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:53,279
levels, has your bowel movements going

1743
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:56,000
well. The parasympathetic nervous system

1744
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,000
is the restorative system. It restores

1745
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,080
the body's harmony. It repairs the

1746
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,080
tissues. Now, what happens is we have

1747
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,239
both of these. Nature gave us the

1748
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,800
sympathetic nervous system to be used

1749
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,400
once in a while only. But we land up

1750
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,640
using it all the time when that's why

1751
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,199
you see all modern diseases hypertension

1752
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:16,640
sympathetic diabetes you know

1753
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:18,480
constipation muscle spondalo all these

1754
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,159
conditions are basically because we are

1755
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,920
using the sympathetic nervous system

1756
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:25,040
which was meant to be used once in a

1757
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,719
while every day. So all the modern

1758
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,199
illnesses that we have are because of

1759
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:30,480
overstimulation of the sympathetic

1760
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,080
nervous system being stressed all the

1761
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,760
time. Being stressed all the time. Now

1762
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,199
the parasympathetic has the exact

1763
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,960
opposite. And you know what you have to

1764
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:39,360
do to stimulate it? Nothing. Just chill,

1765
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,560
relax. All right. But we don't do that.

1766
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,320
In fact, we had done we had done a

1767
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,320
research project at the scan hospital

1768
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,560
medical college in the early '90s where

1769
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,880
we took our own students as subjects

1770
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,120
staff members and we did uh they were

1771
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,120
made to undergo just simple yoga every

1772
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,760
day you know in front over there. So

1773
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,280
there was no question of

1774
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,840
compliance and after testing we found it

1775
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,159
is completely parasympathetic. That

1776
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,000
means

1777
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:09,520
yoga actually stimulates the relaxation

1778
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,440
system internally. Right? Now, if you're

1779
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,679
too relaxed and doing nothing, you have

1780
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,080
over stimulation of the parasympathetic.

1781
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,679
If you're too stressed, you have over

1782
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,520
stimulation of the sympathetic nervous

1783
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,440
system. Again, coming back to what I

1784
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,360
said, everything is about balance. So,

1785
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,640
you need to have both. But for those who

1786
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:29,199
are very stressed out working constantly

1787
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,600
you know u only thinking about their

1788
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:34,480
work and the job and not not having a

1789
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:36,159
life work balance they have to stimulate

1790
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,560
the parasympathetic and those who have

1791
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:41,760
everything you said need need by

1792
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:43,840
creating challenges by you know

1793
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,440
stretching themselves out a little bit

1794
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,760
stimulate their sympathetic nervous

1795
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,760
system so both work in balance we need

1796
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,400
both these systems to work in balance to

1797
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,760
be healthy yoga does that intr ically

1798
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,920
that's why yoga is so useful. Okay.

1799
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,280
You've effectively given out the biology

1800
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,800
and mathematics of how one can achieve

1801
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,679
peace in their human journey.

1802
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,520
Absolutely. So to

1803
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:09,760
summarize, basically your brain has a

1804
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,080
different part of itself dedicated to

1805
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,800
pleasure and a different part dedicated

1806
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,679
to pain over the course of life. They're

1807
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,360
both going to be stimulated. Yes. Now

1808
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,800
human understanding especially when

1809
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,239
you're graduating from school or college

1810
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,199
is hey let's try chasing pleasure that's

1811
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:29,679
how one gets into a hedonistic lifestyle

1812
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,760
because over the course of life you

1813
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:34,400
realize that if I drink this liquid I'll

1814
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,080
probably get drunk if I smoke this herb

1815
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,560
I'll probably get high and you're

1816
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,080
constantly stimulating that many people

1817
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,080
get stuck in that loop and that's what

1818
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,000
we call addictions

1819
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:47,520
of course can also be placed in the same

1820
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,800
bracket but life has to be a combination

1821
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:53,040
of both pleasure and pain. Now,

1822
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,719
hypothetically speaking, if you're only

1823
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,440
chasing pleasure through a hedonistic

1824
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:00,080
lifestyle, eventually you won't be able

1825
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,600
to feel real peace because you're

1826
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,360
constantly in the chase for external

1827
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,880
happiness.

1828
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:08,640
But the actual goal of human life is

1829
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:10,640
tranquility cuz life is going to come at

1830
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,400
you and you need to be able to respond

1831
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,719
correctly which will happen out of a

1832
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,400
tranquil state of mind. And in order to

1833
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,000
create a tranquil state of mind, there

1834
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,199
are two requirements. The first

1835
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,960
requirement is that you have to

1836
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:27,280
challenge yourself just a little bit to

1837
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,960
increase the norepinephrine levels in

1838
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,840
your bloodstream once in a while or

1839
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,480
every day. And secondly, to kind of

1840
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,199
perhaps stimulate that pain part of your

1841
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:39,920
brain as well to keep your brain in

1842
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:42,000
balance. And the second key point is

1843
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,800
ensuring that while your sympathetic

1844
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,280
nervous system is active in the modern

1845
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,040
day because of daily stressors, you

1846
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,000
activate your parasympathetic nervous

1847
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:54,159
system as well through processes like

1848
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,040
yoga, stretching, flexibility based

1849
01:13:54,159 --> 01:14:00,400
movements, regular vacations or simply

1850
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,320
sleeping really well. Yes, absolutely.

1851
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,199
Good point to end the podcast because

1852
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:07,920
it's a pretty heavy piece. Yeah. I just

1853
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:11,360
like to share a little spiritual aspect

1854
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:15,120
to this. Sure. I once heard u a saint

1855
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:18,080
talk about uh what is it like to live a

1856
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:20,400
good life. Okay. He asked and um he said

1857
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,320
if you have these six things your life

1858
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,760
becomes worth living. I'll just you know

1859
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,440
share them with you. Sure. The first

1860
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:29,920
thing he said was shanti. Okay. Peace

1861
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:33,040
because he said without peace that you

1862
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,800
can never live a good life. And where

1863
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,440
how does peace come about? Peace comes

1864
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,199
about by acceptance. It doesn't come

1865
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,120
about by agreement. You may not agree

1866
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:43,920
with somebody but can you just accept

1867
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,679
them? It starts with acceptance of you

1868
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,760
the way you are. Very often we don't

1869
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:50,400
accept ourselves the way we are. So

1870
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:54,320
first was Shanti and the base of Shanti

1871
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:56,320
is acceptance. Then he said shy. So it

1872
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,080
starts with your body. Okay. If your

1873
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,320
body is strong, you will be able to

1874
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,560
combat an infection or a disease. If

1875
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,640
your body is weak, the disease will win.

1876
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,480
Second, your mind. If your mind is not

1877
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,640
strong, people will suppress you. People

1878
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:12,400
will make you do their own things. The

1879
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,719
third thing he said was anund or bliss.

1880
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,840
So what are the difference between anund

1881
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:20,159
and happiness? So happiness is based on

1882
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,440
something outside of you. You get

1883
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,719
something good, something happens to

1884
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,040
you, you're successful, you do

1885
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,440
something. Anand is an internal state.

1886
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,440
All right? It is generated from within.

1887
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,199
It's not dependent on anything from the

1888
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,719
outside.

1889
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:37,239
So the third was Anand. So Shanti,

1890
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:40,560
Shaki, Anand. Fourth thing he said was

1891
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:41,880
gan. So gan is knowledge. What is the

1892
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,040
difference between knowledge and

1893
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:48,080
information? Information is a fact. And

1894
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,040
there is so much of it you know all over

1895
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:53,199
now on the

1896
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:56,080
internet. Gan is that knowledge which

1897
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:58,880
you can put to good use. For example,

1898
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,320
you know the podcast that you do that is

1899
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,480
actually knowledge that you're sharing

1900
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:05,360
with people. So he says very important

1901
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:08,080
to separate knowledge from information,

1902
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,440
right? The fifth thing he said was sunda

1903
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:14,239
or beauty. He said we we are naturally

1904
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:16,080
happy around beautiful places. Like look

1905
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:19,440
at his studio. It's beautiful. You just

1906
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:22,480
enter here and you know your sort of

1907
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,840
alpha waves triggered you know and there

1908
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,480
are some places where you go and you

1909
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,760
don't feel the same.

1910
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:30,159
So it's very interesting he said that

1911
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,000
you know the earth the planet if you

1912
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:34,320
remove human beings from it there is not

1913
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,440
a single ugly spot the planet is very

1914
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,040
beautiful we have messed it up okay so

1915
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,640
and if you think of some of your most

1916
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,480
beautiful times it'll be on a beach or a

1917
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,560
mountain or nature nature is naturally

1918
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,719
beautiful so starting with beauty of

1919
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,520
yourself to your home to your office to

1920
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,679
your surroundings so beauty is a natural

1921
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:55,760
state and the sixth last thing he said

1922
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:57,280
was p or love and it It is there that he

1923
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,120
mentioned what I was sharing with you

1924
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,719
earlier that the true love is that

1925
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,960
between a mother and a child because it

1926
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,600
is unconditional right there's no

1927
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,520
expectation the rest of the kinds of

1928
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,199
love are outcomes of the subconscious

1929
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,000
mind subconscious mind exactly and human

1930
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:13,920
conditioning and societal condition so

1931
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,440
and but the most beautiful part is he

1932
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:20,800
said all these six things Shanti shi

1933
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:22,960
anand gan sundara these are all actually

1934
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,239
internally generated you know they're

1935
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,040
internal states

1936
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,840
And when you live like that, okay, when

1937
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,440
you when you are like

1938
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,360
that, the world adjusts around you, you

1939
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,640
know, no matter what is happening, you

1940
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:39,719
you you you remain in that state. So I

1941
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:41,600
just found and I actually found a

1942
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:44,080
neurobiological base to all of these

1943
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,520
things. You know, all of these are brain

1944
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,000
are connected to the brain, you know,

1945
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,640
all of them. It's all about balancing.

1946
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,360
Acceptance is a state of balance. you

1947
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,880
know uh when you're talking of Shanti it

1948
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,520
is about letting the higher brain have

1949
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,199
control over the lower brain you know I

1950
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,719
mean stuff like that so there is a

1951
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:02,719
neuroscience base but this was from a

1952
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:05,199
spiritual guru I just found it very

1953
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:09,080
interesting that if you just be in that

1954
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:13,440
state what I found the universe around

1955
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:16,880
you sort of uh align aligns itself and

1956
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:20,640
the world responds to how you are

1957
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:24,719
internally okay doctor thank another

1958
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:27,199
epic episode uh for our neuroscience

1959
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:28,800
library. So, just want to say thank you

Absolutely love covering biology. if

1971
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,159
it's as entertaining as our

1972
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:54,080
conversations with Dr. Aloc. Tell us

1973

01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,000
Lots of neuroscience content coming your

1977
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,520
way. Lots of practical content coming

1978
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,199
your way. Even beyond just TRS, what I

1979
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,440
mean by that is something that will

1980
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:17,120
unfold over the next few weeks. So stay

1981
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:19,520
tuned. Lots of novelty is coming your

1982
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:22,000
way. Thank you for listening in Tanvir

1983
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:25,560
and the team looks forward to welcoming

1984
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,560
you again.
