Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,120
and I am Varun Johri.  Hail

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,040
India.  You must have heard about IC 814 Kandahar hijacking.  It was the

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,720
longest running

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,400
hijacking.  But have you

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,240
heard about the IC421 hijacking?  This

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,199
hijacking of IC421 happened in 1984.  This was

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,920

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,680
said to be the longest hijacking in Indian aviation history before Kandahar.  How with the

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,480
help of ISI, seven Khastani separatist

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,960
boys aged between 20 to 22 years were killed.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,800
One of them was 18 years old.  How

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
he did this with the help of a pistol which was

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,480
given to him by ISI.  With his help

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,520
this plane was hijacked.  How

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,399
these boys had full intention of taking it to the US.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,960
After that it is taken to Dubai.

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,559
When this plane took off from Lahore,

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,199

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,840
how suddenly under mysterious circumstances a revolver was found with one of the hijackers and how was the

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,000

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,040

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,159
14-hour negotiation with these seven hijackers in Dubai when the

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
UAE and Indian authorities fooled these seven

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,159
hijackers and

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
finally they were brought to India and

28
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,759
arrested, all the

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,680
passengers were safely evacuated from here and this was

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,880
such a hijacking in which there were many different things and

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,000
a situation had arrived when the

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,479
time had come to land the plane in the sea.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
How was it avoided?  What happened at that time?

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,079
Apart from this, our today's Minister of

present in this plane.  He was targeted

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
by these hijackers.  So

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,360

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,319
today's episode.  So, it starts

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,879
from 1984 till the month of August.  This was the time

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,480
when Operation Blue Star had ended just about 2 months ago.

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,599
Operation Blue Star: You must be

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
aware that military action was taken in the Golden Temple

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,319
and because of this, there was

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,120
a lot of tension in the whole country and in Punjab as well.   The

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,959
atmosphere was warm.  There was a lot of anger within the Sikh community.  There was

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,760

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,080
a lot of anger towards the government.  So, these were all the things.

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,480
But the day of 24th August arrives.

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,040
This incident is said to have happened on August 24, 1984, at around 4:30 in the morning.

71
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,680

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,519
An Indian Airlines flight

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,360
IC421, a Boeing aircraft, took off from Delhi's Palam Airport.  Boeing 37

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,680
737

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,840
This plane was ready to take off.

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
This plane had to go from Delhi to Srinagar.   The

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,920
route of the flight was as it was supposed to be.

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,159
First I would reach Chandigarh from Delhi.  It had to go

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,879
from Chandigarh to Jammu and from Jammu finally to its destination Srinagar.

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,440

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,680
When the passengers boarded the plane in Delhi, there were

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,239
around 122 passengers.   There

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,360
were six crew members.  The captain of the train was

84
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,360
VK Mehta, the main pilot who was commanding.  He had

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,200
associates with him.

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,840
His co-pilot was BAL Ghai.  So he

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,239
was a very experienced pilot of this plane.

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,239
Breakfast begins.  The plane takes off.

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,720
moves towards Chandigarh.  We

90
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,040
had breakfast etc. at our first destination.

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,760
All the things happened.  The plane reaches Chandigarh.  It

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,720
lands.

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,599
After reaching Chandigarh, out of the 122 passengers in the plane,

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,720
67 passengers left

95
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,840
and 31 new passengers boarded.  These

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,920
31 new passengers boarded from Chandigarh.

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,040
Actually there were seven such boys among them.  There were seven such

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,760
boys who were members of the foundation of AISSF

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,799
i.e. All India Sikh Student Federation

100
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,680
and all seven of them

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,079
were hijackers, basically they had come to hijack this plane, so

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,799

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,520
67 people disembarked, 31 new people boarded, these

104
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,240
seven people were also included in it, the names of all the seven were Kamaljit

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,320
Singh, Sadhu Maan Singh, Surinder Singh, Amarinder Singh,

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,280
Amarinder Singh and Devendra Singh,

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,680
both of them were 18 years old, 18 years old, all of them were

108
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,400

109
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,199
boys below 20 years of age.  Apart from this, Tejinder Singh is 21 years old

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,600
, Avtar Singh is 21 years old.  So there were all teenagers

111
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,199
and people like that.  The person who was leading them was

112
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,759
Kam Kamaljit Singh Sadhu.   It is

113
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,080
said about Kamaljit Singh that he was a

114
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,720
clean-shaven man.  He

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,560
came from Mirrorwala village of Firozpur.  Earlier, a shooting incident had also taken place in Chandigarh.

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160

117
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
His name was mentioned there as well.  There was involvement there too.

118
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,280
Apart from this, Man Singh and Surendra Singh,

119
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,240
both were from Sona village in Ropar

120
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,880
but both of them did not

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
wear turban or pagdi.  The remaining four

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,400
hijackers were all

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,479
from Chandigarh.  So that is why all of them met in Chandigarh

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,680
and after that they boarded this plane.

125
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,639
Firstly, this plane took off from Chandigarh.

126
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,120

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,560
This plane was passing over Pathankot.  Do

128
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,039
you all know what the next destination was?

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,600
Jammu.  As the plane was passing over Pathankot

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,840
, suddenly at this moment one of these

131
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,960
seven boys, a hijacker,

132
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,840
stands up.  He saw that

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,240
Anita Singh, the senior air hostess of the flight in front, was

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,320
going towards the cockpit.  He

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,960
follows her and pushes her into the cockpit as she

136
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,440
opens the door.

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,400
As soon as Anita Singh

138
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,440
opposed him, he

139
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,880
even tried to hit her and suddenly while doing all this, the

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
other six hijackers announced

141
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,319
that the plane had been hijacked and the slogans of

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,400
Khalistan Zindabad, Bhinra Wali

143
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,000
Zindabad started echoing in the entire flight.

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,199
Suddenly an atmosphere of fear prevailed

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,280
inside the entire cabin.  Everyone in the flight, including the pilot and the

146
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,680
captain, had understood that the flight had been hijacked.

147
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,319
Well, what they did in the meantime was that the

148
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,360
hijackers took up their positions but at

149
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,360
the same time, they allowed

150
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,039
only one of the two pilots, out of the two captains, to remain in the cockpit.

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,039
Captain Mehta, who was B K Mehta,

152
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,360
only he was allowed to stay here.  Apart from this,

153
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,240
they made the women

154
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,479
sit on the front seats.  The Sikh passengers

155
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,440
from Punjab were also made to sit on the front seats.

156
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,400
Everyone else was pushed back.  So

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,160
all these things were continuously going on

158
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
with the hijackers.  But meanwhile it was seen that there was no weapon in the flight.

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,039
Till that time he did

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,280
not have any weapon, especially a real weapon.

161
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,520
But what was he showing in front of you? You will be

162
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,800
surprised to know that he had

163
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,720
wrapped a newspaper on a cough syrup bottle.

164
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,360
He took out the shoe laces

165
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,680
from inside the cough syrup bottle and was

166
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,560
showing it as if it was a petrol bomb.

167
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,720
Meaning, in reality he did not have a single weapon by the

168
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,479
time he left Chandigarh.

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,319
Still, he had made some fake weapons of this type.  The

170
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
second was another fake

171
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,880
weapon in which these

172
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,960
hijackers used a leather case for the camera,

173
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,919

174
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,800
you might have seen that it is a leather case in which the camera is kept.

175
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,759
What they did to it was that they

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,599
put a digital watch in front of it and by fixing that digital watch they were making

177
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,160
it look as if

178
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,639
it was a time bomb.   By

179
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,120
applying a digital wash to the camera case.

180
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
Well, after seeing this thing,

181
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,599
Anita Singh who was the senior

182
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,120
rosters of the flight, was told all these things during training.

183
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,199
is shown.  What kind of

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,759
things happen.  So she had understood that

185
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,879
they were showing a fake, a kind of time bomb

186
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,639
here.  But the point was such that an

187
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,879
atmosphere of terror, an atmosphere of fear

188
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,360
started to build up in the entire flight.  These hijackers also showed some

189
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,919
poisonous pins which are used to adjust the turban

190
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,919

191
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,919
and said that these are poisonous pins.  If

192
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,319
we inject this into you, you could lose your life.  I

193
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,400
started doing these kind of things here.

194
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,879
But overall all these

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,800
things were fake.  But an atmosphere of fear had

196
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,280
developed among the passengers.  Now this plane IC421 was

197
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
in the possession of these hijackers.  The hijackers'

198
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,360
first demand is revealed.

199
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,800
He told the pilot to take the plane to Lahore,

200
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,159
Pakistan.  We have to go to Lahore from here.

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,959
Before this he had told the pilot that when

202
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,519
we move forward,

203
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,680
you have to make two rounds over the Golden Temple above Amritsar.

204
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
That means, in a way, that was their method.   It had become

205
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,480
clear to everyone that recently,

206
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,720
two months ago, Operation Blue Booster happened and

207
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
through it, six sentiments were hurt.

208
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
So this is their way of

209
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,200
taking revenge.  To express one's anger towards the government.

210
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
So this was understood by the

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,440
pilot as well as the other passengers.

212
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,760
So these hijackers told the pilot to make the

213
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,040

214
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,680
plane circle twice over the Golden Temple of Amritsar and

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,160
then take it straight to Lahore.  All these

216
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,080
things happened.  The plane moves towards Lahore.

217
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,240
As soon as the hijacked plane, which was IC421,

218
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,480
enters Pakistani airspace, it

219
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
enters.  Suddenly the

220
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,120
Lahore Air Traffic Control blocked its runway.

221
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,040
Permission for landing was

222
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,880
refused.  Now you see, the double

223
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,959
standards of Pakistan are once again

224
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,320
coming to the fore in many cases.  But

225
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,200
this time also the hijacking has been done by your ISI.

226
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Still, in a way,

227
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
because such a big hijacking has

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,360
happened of such a big Indian aircraft,

229
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
when this case will be presented before the world, it

230
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
should be seen in such a way that Pakistan had not done anything.

231
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,000
We even refused to let it land on our runway.

232
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
We have

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
no involvement in this.  But this

234
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
was a kind of Pakistani drama.  Pakistan

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,040
initially refused to give landing permission.

236
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,800
Blocked the runway.  The fuel that was there was

237
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
continuously depleting.  Because there was a

238
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,760
regional flight, basically I had to go from Delhi to

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,959
Srinagar.  But after Lahore, the

240
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,760
fuel in Lahore is continuously decreasing.  It is

241
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,720
said that this flight kept circling the Lahore air traffic airport for about 80 minutes.

242
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,600

243
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,120

244
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,760
Lahore did

245
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,720
not maintain any kind of coordination with the

246
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,720
air pilot of the Indian plane and

247
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,279
said that we will not allow you to come here, we will

248
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,240
not allow you to land.  Well finally

249
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,839
it is reported that around 9:30 am the

250
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,839
controllers gave the signal from Lahore ATC

251
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,839
that you have permission to land here.   That

252
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,000
is, there was a drama that Pakistan wanted to enact

253
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,600
and finally it was shown that when your

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,920
fuel was running out, we

255
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,560
allowed you to land.  Well after this, upon

256
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,360
landing in Lahore, the

257
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,839
turning point of the entire hijacking incident came to light.   The

258
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,920
authority of India was PM Indira Gandhi.

259
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
They all knew that one of our planes had been

260
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,959
hijacked.  The news of this had been received

261
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,519
below.  Indira Gandhi personally spoke to the then

262
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,399
President of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq.  I

263
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,240
requested him that

264
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
our plane has just reached Lahore.

265
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
Just don't let it proceed beyond Lahore.  Please

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,519
stop it here somehow.

267
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,839
But it was seen that this

268
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,880
demand, this request was not heard.

269
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,440
Well at that time, our Indian

270
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,160
diplomat K D Sharma, posted in the

271
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,079
High Commission in Islamabad, directly reached Lahore to

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,240
handle this crisis.

273
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,279
But it came to light that the time taken by him to reach

274
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Lahore was not much time actually.

275
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:40,000
But despite that, Pakistan was

276
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,680
going to fly this plane from here to Lahore.

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,279
It was about to take off from here.

278
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,200
When KD Sharma reached there, he himself

279
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,760
told that when I reached Lahore the plane was

280
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,800
already taking off.  I didn't want the

281
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,279
plane to leave the airfield.  Leave Lahore Air

282
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,440
Field.  The Pakistani commandos

283
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,560
could have stun the plane by

284
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,519
entering here.  These Christian terrorists, these

285
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,600
separatists, all of them

286
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,639
could have been removed from here.  Well, all these things could

287
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,480
n’t happen.  When the plane was parked in Lahore, the

288
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,800
hijackers started

289
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,800
discussions with the Pakistani officers.

290
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
It was

291
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,399
also noticed by the other passengers that there were many Pakistani

292
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,399
officers coming in and

293
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,959
going out, who were hi-jackers and were

294
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,279
considering the environment as home for them.

295
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,880
He had a conversation with the officers.  These

296
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,639
people also saw many maps there in

297
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,399
Lahore in Pakistan.

298
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240

299
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
He was also discussing with these Pakistani officers about what to choose as the next destination and what to decide.

300
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
Overall, it was understood

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,880
that the whole plotting of this hazing was done by

302
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,360
Pakistan.  Well,

303
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,560
five passengers were also left in Lahore.  There were

304
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,120
five passengers, three of whom were said to be

305
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,360
women.  There was a very small child.

306
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,519
He was taken down.  But there was a twist here

307
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,680
as well.  When this plane took off from Lahore.  I have

308
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,399
taken off to move ahead.

309
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,560
Now it was being taken to Karachi.

310
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,079
After taking off from Lahore, suddenly it was seen

311
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:09,440
that one of the hijackers was seen carrying a

312
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:13,360
7.65 mm Wether pistol, i.e. a

313
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,839
German pistol.

314
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,760
He placed this pistol in front of Captain Mehta

315
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,600
and said that he would have to do as he said

316
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,360
otherwise all the people would be killed one by one.

317
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,959
Now he started threatening with all these things

318
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,279
and this time a real

319
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,920
pistol, a real weapon, was

320
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,160
seen in his hand.  This is what is said about this weapon

321
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,079
and solid evidence has come to light.  It

322
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,320
is also written in many novels.

323
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
At that time there were also two British passengers

324
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
in the plane, Dominic Bar Barclay and

325
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,920
his wife.  Both of them also later

326
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,800
claimed that they had seen a

327
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,720
hijacker come out of the plane.  An officer was

328
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,480
standing outside there who had

329
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,040
kept something inside a white colored paper.  He gave it

330
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,360
to this hijacker.  The hijacker came inside and took

331
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,240
out a pistol from the same paper and

332
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,519
kept it in his pocket and later he

333
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,680
pointed it at the head of pilot Mehta.  This

334
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,279
thing became clear from here.  When the investigation took place

335
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,120
later, it was found out that this

336
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,040
pistol was basically a West German

337
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,519
pistol.  It was given to the Pakistan Government.

338
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,279
ISI used it in this hijacking

339
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,000
and it was later published in books also.

340
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,279
Well, when this weapon was later

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,440
handed over to India by UAE,

342
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,680
then in the 4-15 page judgment in the special court in Ajmer,

343
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,360
it was also

344
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,800
made a strong proof against Pakistan.

345
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,959
Well,

346
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,839
after this plane took off from Lahore, it

347
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,519
reached Karachi because refueling had to be done.

348
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,920
Arrived here for refuelling.  Here

349
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,240
too, there were two passengers, two

350
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,519
women holding British passports.  There were women, they were left alone.

351
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,680
stripped down.  But the hijackers were now

352
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,480
confused.  He was still not clear

353
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,720
whether he had reached Pakistan.  I

354
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,519
took the revolver that I had to take from ISI.  Now

355
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,079
what should we do next?  Where should I go?  He was constantly

356
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,040
thinking that he had to go to the US and London.  We will

357
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,519
take the flight to London or to America.

358
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,000
But when they were explained

359
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,880
by the pilot VK Mehta that this is a regional

360
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,279
flight, it does not have the capacity nor that much

361
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,600
fuel, no matter how many refuelings you do, we

362
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,800
cannot take it to the US on such a long

363
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,199
journey, so they understood somewhere, but

364
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,920
after this they said take it to Bahrain,

365
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,560
now fly this flight from Karachi, take off

366
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,480
and we will go directly to Bahrain, the Bahrain

367
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,040
option was tried but the

368
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,639
authorities there did not give permission for landing at all,

369
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,120
after this when landing permission was

370
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,920
not given in Bahrain, the hijackers

371
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,480
told pilot VK Mehta that now the next

372
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,040
destination would be Dubai.  Should land in Dubai.  The

373
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,680

374
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,320
situation inside the plane became more tense while reaching Dubai.

375
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
People were feeling the pressure.  Now there

376
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,759
was a pistol as well.  He also had a real

377
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,199
weapon.  Although even earlier people

378
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,199
felt that these other things were

379
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,320
also weapons.  Later it was found out that

380
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,800
all this was fake.  But the pistol was real.  So the

381
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
plane is being made to take off from one place to another again and again.

382
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,160
Refueling is happening continuously.

383
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,519
Anything can happen.  The hijackers are also feeling frustrated

384
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,040

385
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
because the time has already passed.

386
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,800
Well, all these things were going on continuously.

387
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,120
But the decision to reach Dubai

388
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,440
also faced many problems.

389
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,240
UAE authorities

390
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,800
refused to give landing permission to the plane.  When Dubai

391
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,880
ATC was contacted.  Landing permission was

392
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,440
refused.  Even the runway

393
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,000
lights were switched off in Dubai.   It was

394
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,480
around night time and the airport looked pitch dark at this time. The

395
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,560

396
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,880
pilots from Dubai tell that the runway

397
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,880
lights were switched off.  All radio

398
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,759
transmissions were switched off by Dubai and

399
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,680
its UAE authorities.

400
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
Nothing was visible.  It was pitch dark and everything was

401
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,639
visible and the little fuel that was there was

402
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,199
running at dangerously low levels.  That means there was

403
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,160
only a few minutes of fuel

404
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,360
left.  Captain Mehta then

405
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,199
told the Dubai officers that

406
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,360
he had repeated the request.

407
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,520
He said that you believe in Allah.

408
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,000
In the name of Allah.  Please

409
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,160
listen to our request.  Please give us a chance.

410
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,679
Let us land here.  Otherwise

411
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,439
so many people would have lost their lives.  But

412
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,039
for a long time it was observed that no response

413
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,679
came.  Meanwhile, the atmosphere inside the plane started

414
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,039
becoming more tense because the

415
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,880
senior air hostess Rita Singh, who

416
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,039
was a member of the cabin crew, basically

417
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,280
announced to the passengers that

418
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,960
if the landing does not happen in Dubai, then the

419
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,000
pilots will have to attempt a

420
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,400
ditch landing in the sea which is nearby

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,720
and for this the

422
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
captain also gave the call "pre brace for impact" which is

423
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,880
given at this time,

424
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,440
in such landings, inside the plane, the captain

425
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,360
also gave the pre

426
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,760
brace for impact call to the passengers, so the cabin crew Rita

427
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,919
Singh said that if we are not

428
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,080
able to land here, then we will have to land in the water

429
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:07,200
but such a miracle happened, such a

430
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,520
miracle happened that suddenly the lights of the runway of Dubai turn

431
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,160
on.  A

432
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,000
message comes from Dubai officers saying okay, you

433
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,120
can land here.  After this, the pilot

434
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,520
B K Mehta, while shouting and dancing with joy,

435
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,679
said God bless you,

436
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,360
God bless your country.  You

437
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,039
helped us a lot and this is a big thing

438
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,360
because friends, it is said that

439
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,440
only 5 minutes of fuel was left.  A water

440
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,080
landing would have been necessary.  Well here

441
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,080
finally this plane

442
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,120
lands in Dubai and by now it had been about

443
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,559
22 hours since it was hijacked.  Friends,

444

467
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,880
this episode.  The plane landed in Dubai

468
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,600

469
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,000
at around 4:50 according to Dubai local time.  And meanwhile it is also

470
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,480
said that

471
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,880
Anita Singh, the senior airstice person in the flight, also

472
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,520
knew this and the captain also knew that when this

473
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,760
plane took off from Lahore.  Only after this,

474
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,840
an aircraft of our Indian Air Force, which

475
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,799
was an aircraft relief aircraft of Indian

476
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Airlines, went after this hijack pen.  There was

477
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,320
relief equipment in the aircraft

478
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,400
, there were people, there were doctors, there was a

479
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,240
medical team.  Commandos were also there.

480
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320

481
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,640
From here onwards, the entire hijack team was behind this plane to take over it.

482
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
Whether it was going to Bahrain or

483
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,880
else it was going to Dubai.  So,

484
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,960
when this hijacked plane landed in Dubai,

485
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,200
our aircraft, which was a relief

486
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
aircraft, also landed behind it.   By

487
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,520
this time the hijackers had completely

488
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,440
understood that they did not have many options left.  The

489
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,360
time for negotiations has arrived.

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
Negotiations will have to be done.  But it was seen

491
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,960
in Dubai that Kamaljeet Singh Sadhu, who was a

492
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
hijacker, was the main hijacker and with him there was

493
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
another hijacker whose name was said to be

494
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,679
Monty.  Nick was calling him Monty.

495
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,600
Both of them were still continuously

496
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,280
demanding to go from Dubai to US or London.

497
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,640
But later it was explained to them that

498
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,200
you cannot go from the US, from the UAE,

499
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,960
from Dubai, you cannot go out here.

500
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,360
Some more High Jackers were mentioned

501
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,159
in later statements by the air hostesses, including

502
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,960
that there was an High Jacker named Kiss.  He

503
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,280
looked 15 years old but was actually 22 years old.

504
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,320
He gave a postcard to an air hostess

505
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,400
Urvashi to send it to his home.   I

506
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,240
wrote it on it.  But later, God

507
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,640
knows what came into his mind that he

508
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,440
tore the postcard himself and

509
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,679
ate the paper.  So these kinds of things also

510
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,480
happened.  There was a hijacker named Amarinder Singh.

511
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,400
He threatened the pilots that if any

512
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,080
trouble occurs, I will kill you all.   The

513
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,720
work of intimidation was being done by Amarinder Singh.

514
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, now the phase of negotiations has begun.

515
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,440
Currently the Defense Minister of UAE who is also the

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,039
Prime Minister of UAE today.

517
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,840
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.  So Sheikh

518
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,760
Mohammed bin bin Rashid Al Maktoum is said to have been out at that time.

519
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,360
He

520
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,280
was not in Dubai.  He suddenly reaches Dubai.

521
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,960
He took the negotiations in his own hands and said that

522
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,919
negotiations would be done with these people.  Ok

523
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,559
?  Came forward and it was a very good thing.

524
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,120
India's ambassador to Dubai at that time, Ishrat

525
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,280
Aziz, was also there.  Former Foreign

526
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,960
Secretary Domesh Bhandari also reached there.

527
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,080
Well, apart from this, Indian Minister of

528
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,080
State for External Affairs A Rahim was

529
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:01,120
in Qatar at that time.  They were going to Qatar and had to

530
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,960
stop over in Dubai and suddenly at this

531
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,880
time this hijacked plane landed in Dubai.

532
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
So they also reach the airport directly.

533
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
Now the phase of negotiation has

534
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,480
started which is critical because

535
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
you all know the situation of negotiation.   The

536
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,240
hijackers were continuously threatening that

537
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
if our demands were not met then we would die.   The

538
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,559
demand is that we have to go to the US.

539
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,320
If we are taken there, we

540
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,799
want political asylum and all these things.  If they do

541
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,720
not agree then we will

542
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,679
kill people one by one.  Well at this time,

543
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,440
another very important person who was

544
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,200
present inside this plane, in this hijacked

545
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,440
plane from the very beginning, was K.

546
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,880
Subramaniam.  K. Subrahmanyam, the father of

547
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,679
our present Minister of Defence Affairs S.

548
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,360
Jaishankar Sahib, was at that time the

549
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,320

550
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,280
Director of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA).  So,

551
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,200
a very notable personality was on that plane

552
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,679
and somehow the

553
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,000
hijackers came to know about this.  So

554
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,720
it was seen that Suddenly K Subramanyam was

555
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,640
diabetic.  It had been a long journey for them.  It had been

556
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,720
more than a day since the hijacking.

557
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,640
So he

558
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,440
needed a lot of insulin shots.  There was an instant need.   There

559
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,360
was urgency.  So it was seen that when this was

560
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,000
further informed by the hijackers to the

561
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,240
UAE ATC, Dubai ATC.  So

562
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,080
finally two ambulances suddenly arrive outside the

563
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,840
hijacked plane.  They are

564
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,679
given insulin.  But later,

565
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,480
taking them as a target, these hijackers

566
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,400
targeted basically India that we will

567
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,159
start killing people one by one and

568
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,039
do all these things.  If our demands are not

569
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,200
met.  So anyway while the plane was parked here

570
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,640
Subramaniam was given insulin shots.

571
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,120
After this he became normal.

572
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,200
Brought back to the plane.  After a while, the food

573
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,240
and water finally arrived inside the plane.

574
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,559
Meanwhile, the hijackers were continuously making the

575
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,240
passengers raise slogans of Khaistan Zindabad and Bindra

576
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,919
Wale Zindabad.  They were

577
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,000
also making the passengers raise slogans, and the

578
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,320

579
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,799
hijackers, one after the other, sometimes

580
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,960
started threatening them.  Meanwhile, another thing was seen that

581
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,200
a hijacker was swept away so much in the flow of water.

582
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,280
A funny, ridiculous,

583
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,080
comedy scene was created there where he

584
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,520
said 'Down with Pakistan'.  Suddenly

585
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
as soon as he said 'Pakistan Murdabad', the

586
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,159
hijackers around him got angry seeing him.

587
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,080
So then he said Pakistan Zindabad

588
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,400
and all such things were

589
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,799
said there.  Well, ultimately all these IJKers

590
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,640
understood that the negotiations would have to be done with the

591
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,720
UAE authorities and

592
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,440
with the Indian officers.  You will

593
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,400
have to agree with his words also.  But this

594
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,520
initial negotiation went on for about 14 hours and first two

595
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,919
hijackers came out.  Used to come to ATC and

596
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,320
talk.  There, UAE officers were

597
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,720

598
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,279

599
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,320
interacting with the UAE officers including the Defence Minister of that time, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.  Used to talk to A Rahim of India.

600
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,320
So all these things happened.   After

601
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,039
some time other hijackers would come again.  He would

602
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,000
come again.  But these negotiations

603
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,480
lasted for about 14 hours.  At 5:30 in the evening,

604
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,559
suddenly a proper final

605
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,880
ultimatum was given

606
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,159
to the hijackers and then

607
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,480
at 6:50 it was reported that the hijackers were

608
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,320
promised asylum in the US.

609
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,080
Basically, we were told that

610
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,679
we should be taken to the US as they had been demanding for a long time.

611
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,120
Asylum should be given in the US, political

612
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,200
asylum should be given.  After this, the

613
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,400
demands of the passengers were accepted

614
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,480
because apart from this they could not do anything else

615
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,240
here.  Passengers

616
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,400
then saw buses belonging to the Dubai National Airlines

617
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,720
Transport authorities

618
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,120
parked near the fire

619
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,679
and within 10 minutes, at around 7:00 pm, the

620
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,840

621
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,640

622
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,039
UAE authorities moved in to finally evacuate the 75 passengers and six crew members from the plane.

623
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,559
Everyone was then taken to the air-conditioned transit lunch.

624
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,559
There they were given rest and

625
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,679
refreshment.  The hijackers were

626
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,200
taken away in a bait van.  UAE

627
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,600
basically gave only two options to these hijackers during the

628
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,520
negotiations by the Indian and

629
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,640
UAE authorities.  He had said that

630
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,799
either you should face the trial under the law that exists in UAE.

631
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,919
Here you will always have the

632
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,200
threat of death penalty.   The

633
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,360
second thing is that you go back to India.

634
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,279
Go back to India.  Face trial there.

635
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,279
In this you must be seeing that the

636
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,120
promise of giving political asylum to go to the US was made

637
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,360
earlier.  They were basically

638
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,520
fooled by UAE.

639
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,000
Because the US envoy of that time had

640
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,159
clearly refused that you can say this

641
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,200
but if you send them and if

642
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,880
this drama of yours continues further that

643
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,159
you will get political

644
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,159
asylum for the hijackers in the US, then if you do

645
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,000
this, we will not give them asylum

646
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,159
but as soon as they set foot on US soil,

647
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,480
they will be arrested, so

648
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
anyway this thing was also told to the hijackers

649
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
that the US has already refused, has

650
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,520
rejected your request for political asylum,

651
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,760
so the hijackers finally

652
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,919
chose the option of going to India and after this

653
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,640
they were brought to India, the UAE authorities

654
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,000

655
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,720
also gave the German pistol to the CBI, these hijackers were

656
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,880
handed over to them, the rescued passengers and

657
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,360
finally the crew members were brought to India,

658
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,480
from UAE to Delhi, the hijackers reached Chandigarh on 2 September 1984,

659
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,159
they were taken to Chandigarh, from

660
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,159
there they were brought to Delhi,

661
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,640

662
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,279
they were kept in the joint custody of CBI and IB, anti-terrorism charges were imposed on them

663
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,240

664
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,720
Under section four and five of the Hijacking Act 198 (1982), section 120B of IPC,

665
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,520
criminal conspiracy, now it is the Indian

666
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,840
Judicial Code (BNS) IPC,

667
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,520
apart from this, charge of 506 criminal intimidation was imposed,

668
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,760

669
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,919
under PC Gupta, the magistrate in Chandigarh,

670
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,840
he gave his custody for 19 days to the

671
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,080
police, he was kept on police remand,

672
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,799
after 19 days, the investigation in Delhi

673
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,400
continued, after this it was seen

674
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,679
that the hearing in the special court of Ajmer, which was

675
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:43,120
conducted under Justice R K Jain, 87

676
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,440
witnesses, around 500 documents were before them,

677
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,400
they were examined,

678
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,760

679
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,679
a very big statement of K Subramaniam sahab, father of S Jaishankar, K Subramaniam, means

680
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,799
all his statements were such that he was a

681
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,919
witness here.  In the final judgment of 415 pages, the

682
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,840

683
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,840
pistol which was recovered from Lahore was also mentioned and

684
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,720
it was made a major point and finally all the

685
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,480
seven hijackers were

686
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,159
sentenced to life imprisonment.

687
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,640
Sentenced to life imprisonment.  But one big

688
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,080
thing that was seen was that in 1999, when the

689
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,799
Kandar hijacking of IC814 took place, at that

690
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,080
time all these hijackers were released.

691
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,440
That means the Khaastanis who were separatists were

692
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,240
also left there along with the rest of Masood Azar,

693
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,640
Umar Shad Sheikh and all others.

694
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,840
So these seven were also released here

695
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,559
and in the meantime it was told that

696
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,640
either this was some internal

697
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,200
dealing of ISI which happened in the negotiations

698
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,919
that took place in Kandahar or apart from this, at that

699
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,559
time many such prisoners were released from Indian jails and

700
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,880
under that

701
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,159
all of them were released.  So, this was one such

702
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,039
hijacking of IC421 aircraft of Indian

703
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,960
Airlines in which a very

704
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,000
big role of Pakistan came to light and in fact the

705
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,640
role of ISI, let me tell you that between 1981 and 1984,

706
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,360
a lot of hijackings took place which were

707
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,919
carried out by Christian separatists.  The

708
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,559
role of ISI came to light in all these.  And in fact,

709
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,120
between 1971 and 1999, Indian Airlines was the

710
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,200
only good

711
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,600
airline in India that was operating aircraft.   It

712
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,679
