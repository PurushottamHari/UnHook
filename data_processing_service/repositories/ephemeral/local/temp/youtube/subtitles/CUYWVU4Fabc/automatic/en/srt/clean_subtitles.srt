This was the time when Operation Blue Star had ended just about 2 months ago. Operation Blue Star: You must be aware that military action was taken in the Golden Temple and because of this, there was a lot of tension in the whole country and in Punjab as well.   The atmosphere was warm.  There was a lot of anger within the Sikh community.  There was a lot of anger towards the government.  So, these were all the things. But the day of 24th August arrives. This incident is said to have happened on August 24, 1984, at around 4:30 in the morning. An Indian Airlines flight IC421, a Boeing aircraft, took off from Delhi's Palam Airport.  Boeing 37 This plane was ready to take off. This plane had to go from Delhi to Srinagar.   The route of the flight was as it was supposed to be. First I would reach Chandigarh from Delhi.  It had to go from Chandigarh to Jammu and from Jammu finally to its destination Srinagar. When the passengers boarded the plane in Delhi, there were around 122 passengers.   There were six crew members.  The captain of the train was VK Mehta, the main pilot who was commanding.  He had associates with him. His co-pilot was BAL Ghai.  So he was a very experienced pilot of this plane. Breakfast begins.  The plane takes off. moves towards Chandigarh.  We had breakfast etc. at our first destination. All the things happened.  The plane reaches Chandigarh.  It lands. After reaching Chandigarh, out of the 122 passengers in the plane, 67 passengers left and 31 new passengers boarded.  These 31 new passengers boarded from Chandigarh. Actually there were seven such boys among them.  There were seven such boys who were members of the foundation of AISSF i.e. All India Sikh Student Federation and all seven of them were hijackers, basically they had come to hijack this plane, so 67 people disembarked, 31 new people boarded, these seven people were also included in it, the names of all the seven were Kamaljit Singh, Sadhu Maan Singh, Surinder Singh, Amarinder Singh, Amarinder Singh and Devendra Singh, both of them were 18 years old, 18 years old, all of them were boys below 20 years of age.  Apart from this, Tejinder Singh is 21 years old , Avtar Singh is 21 years old.  So there were all teenagers and people like that.  The person who was leading them was Kam Kamaljit Singh Sadhu.   It is said about Kamaljit Singh that he was a clean-shaven man.  He came from Mirrorwala village of Firozpur.  Earlier, a shooting incident had also taken place in Chandigarh. His name was mentioned there as well.  There was involvement there too. Apart from this, Man Singh and Surendra Singh, both were from Sona village in Ropar but both of them did not wear turban or pagdi.  The remaining four hijackers were all from Chandigarh.  So that is why all of them met in Chandigarh and after that they boarded this plane. Firstly, this plane took off from Chandigarh. This plane was passing over Pathankot.  Do you all know what the next destination was? Jammu.  As the plane was passing over Pathankot , suddenly at this moment one of these seven boys, a hijacker, stands up.  He saw that Anita Singh, the senior air hostess of the flight in front, was going towards the cockpit.  He follows her and pushes her into the cockpit as she opens the door. As soon as Anita Singh opposed him, he even tried to hit her and suddenly while doing all this, the other six hijackers announced that the plane had been hijacked and the slogans of Khalistan Zindabad, Bhinra Wali Zindabad started echoing in the entire flight. Suddenly an atmosphere of fear prevailed inside the entire cabin.  Everyone in the flight, including the pilot and the captain, had understood that the flight had been hijacked. Well, what they did in the meantime was that the hijackers took up their positions but at the same time, they allowed only one of the two pilots, out of the two captains, to remain in the cockpit. Captain Mehta, who was B K Mehta, only he was allowed to stay here.  Apart from this, they made the women sit on the front seats.  The Sikh passengers from Punjab were also made to sit on the front seats. Everyone else was pushed back.  So all these things were continuously going on with the hijackers.  But meanwhile it was seen that there was no weapon in the flight. Till that time he did not have any weapon, especially a real weapon. But what was he showing in front of you? You will be surprised to know that he had wrapped a newspaper on a cough syrup bottle. He took out the shoe laces from inside the cough syrup bottle and was showing it as if it was a petrol bomb. Meaning, in reality he did not have a single weapon by the time he left Chandigarh. Still, he had made some fake weapons of this type.  The second was another fake weapon in which these hijackers used a leather case for the camera, you might have seen that it is a leather case in which the camera is kept. What they did to it was that they put a digital watch in front of it and by fixing that digital watch they were making it look as if it was a time bomb.   By applying a digital wash to the camera case. Well, after seeing this thing, Anita Singh who was the senior rosters of the flight, was told all these things during training. is shown.  What kind of things happen.  So she had understood that they were showing a fake, a kind of time bomb here.  But the point was such that an atmosphere of terror, an atmosphere of fear started to build up in the entire flight.  These hijackers also showed some poisonous pins which are used to adjust the turban and said that these are poisonous pins.  If we inject this into you, you could lose your life.  I started doing these kind of things here. But overall all these things were fake.  But an atmosphere of fear had developed among the passengers.  Now this plane IC421 was in the possession of these hijackers.  The hijackers' first demand is revealed. He told the pilot to take the plane to Lahore, Pakistan.  We have to go to Lahore from here. Before this he had told the pilot that when we move forward, you have to make two rounds over the Golden Temple above Amritsar. That means, in a way, that was their method.   It had become clear to everyone that recently, two months ago, Operation Blue Booster happened and through it, six sentiments were hurt. So this is their way of taking revenge.  To express one's anger towards the government. So this was understood by the pilot as well as the other passengers. So these hijackers told the pilot to make the plane circle twice over the Golden Temple of Amritsar and then take it straight to Lahore.  All these things happened.  The plane moves towards Lahore. As soon as the hijacked plane, which was IC421, enters Pakistani airspace, it enters.  Suddenly the Lahore Air Traffic Control blocked its runway. Permission for landing was refused.  Now you see, the double standards of Pakistan are once again coming to the fore in many cases.  But this time also the hijacking has been done by your ISI. Still, in a way, because such a big hijacking has happened of such a big Indian aircraft, when this case will be presented before the world, it should be seen in such a way that Pakistan had not done anything. We even refused to let it land on our runway. We have no involvement in this.  But this was a kind of Pakistani drama.  Pakistan initially refused to give landing permission. Blocked the runway.  The fuel that was there was continuously depleting.  Because there was a regional flight, basically I had to go from Delhi to Srinagar.  But after Lahore, the fuel in Lahore is continuously decreasing.  It is said that this flight kept circling the Lahore air traffic airport for about 80 minutes. Lahore did not maintain any kind of coordination with the air pilot of the Indian plane and said that we will not allow you to come here, we will not allow you to land.  Well finally it is reported that around 9:30 am the controllers gave the signal from Lahore ATC that you have permission to land here.   That is, there was a drama that Pakistan wanted to enact and finally it was shown that when your fuel was running out, we allowed you to land.  Well after this, upon landing in Lahore, the turning point of the entire hijacking incident came to light.   The authority of India was PM Indira Gandhi. They all knew that one of our planes had been hijacked.  The news of this had been received below.  Indira Gandhi personally spoke to the then President of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq.  I requested him that our plane has just reached Lahore. Just don't let it proceed beyond Lahore.  Please stop it here somehow. But it was seen that this demand, this request was not heard. Well at that time, our Indian diplomat K D Sharma, posted in the High Commission in Islamabad, directly reached Lahore to handle this crisis. But it came to light that the time taken by him to reach Lahore was not much time actually. But despite that, Pakistan was going to fly this plane from here to Lahore. It was about to take off from here. When KD Sharma reached there, he himself told that when I reached Lahore the plane was already taking off.  I didn't want the plane to leave the airfield.  Leave Lahore Air Field.  The Pakistani commandos could have stun the plane by entering here.  These Christian terrorists, these separatists, all of them could have been removed from here.  Well, all these things could n’t happen.  When the plane was parked in Lahore, the hijackers started discussions with the Pakistani officers. It was also noticed by the other passengers that there were many Pakistani officers coming in and going out, who were hi-jackers and were considering the environment as home for them. He had a conversation with the officers.  These people also saw many maps there in Lahore in Pakistan. He was also discussing with these Pakistani officers about what to choose as the next destination and what to decide. Overall, it was understood that the whole plotting of this hazing was done by Pakistan.  Well, five passengers were also left in Lahore.  There were five passengers, three of whom were said to be women.  There was a very small child. He was taken down.  But there was a twist here as well.  When this plane took off from Lahore.  I have taken off to move ahead. Now it was being taken to Karachi. After taking off from Lahore, suddenly it was seen that one of the hijackers was seen carrying a 7.65 mm Wether pistol, i.e. a German pistol. He placed this pistol in front of Captain Mehta and said that he would have to do as he said otherwise all the people would be killed one by one. Now he started threatening with all these things and this time a real pistol, a real weapon, was seen in his hand.  This is what is said about this weapon and solid evidence has come to light.  It is also written in many novels. At that time there were also two British passengers in the plane, Dominic Bar Barclay and his wife.  Both of them also later claimed that they had seen a hijacker come out of the plane.  An officer was standing outside there who had kept something inside a white colored paper.  He gave it to this hijacker.  The hijacker came inside and took out a pistol from the same paper and kept it in his pocket and later he pointed it at the head of pilot Mehta.  This thing became clear from here.  When the investigation took place later, it was found out that this pistol was basically a West German pistol.  It was given to the Pakistan Government. ISI used it in this hijacking and it was later published in books also. Well, when this weapon was later handed over to India by UAE, then in the 4-15 page judgment in the special court in Ajmer, it was also made a strong proof against Pakistan. Well, after this plane took off from Lahore, it reached Karachi because refueling had to be done. Arrived here for refuelling.  Here too, there were two passengers, two women holding British passports.  There were women, they were left alone. stripped down.  But the hijackers were now confused.  He was still not clear whether he had reached Pakistan.  I took the revolver that I had to take from ISI.  Now what should we do next?  Where should I go?  He was constantly thinking that he had to go to the US and London.  We will take the flight to London or to America. But when they were explained by the pilot VK Mehta that this is a regional flight, it does not have the capacity nor that much fuel, no matter how many refuelings you do, we cannot take it to the US on such a long journey, so they understood somewhere, but after this they said take it to Bahrain, now fly this flight from Karachi, take off and we will go directly to Bahrain, the Bahrain option was tried but the authorities there did not give permission for landing at all, after this when landing permission was not given in Bahrain, the hijackers told pilot VK Mehta that now the next destination would be Dubai.  Should land in Dubai.  The situation inside the plane became more tense while reaching Dubai. People were feeling the pressure.  Now there was a pistol as well.  He also had a real weapon.  Although even earlier people felt that these other things were also weapons.  Later it was found out that all this was fake.  But the pistol was real.  So the plane is being made to take off from one place to another again and again. Refueling is happening continuously. Anything can happen.  The hijackers are also feeling frustrated because the time has already passed. Well, all these things were going on continuously. But the decision to reach Dubai also faced many problems. UAE authorities refused to give landing permission to the plane.  When Dubai ATC was contacted.  Landing permission was refused.  Even the runway lights were switched off in Dubai.   It was around night time and the airport looked pitch dark at this time. The pilots from Dubai tell that the runway lights were switched off.  All radio transmissions were switched off by Dubai and its UAE authorities. Nothing was visible.  It was pitch dark and everything was visible and the little fuel that was there was running at dangerously low levels.  That means there was only a few minutes of fuel left.  Captain Mehta then told the Dubai officers that he had repeated the request. He said that you believe in Allah. In the name of Allah.  Please listen to our request.  Please give us a chance. Let us land here.  Otherwise so many people would have lost their lives.  But for a long time it was observed that no response came.  Meanwhile, the atmosphere inside the plane started becoming more tense because the senior air hostess Rita Singh, who was a member of the cabin crew, basically announced to the passengers that if the landing does not happen in Dubai, then the pilots will have to attempt a ditch landing in the sea which is nearby and for this the captain also gave the call "pre brace for impact" which is given at this time, in such landings, inside the plane, the captain also gave the pre brace for impact call to the passengers, so the cabin crew Rita Singh said that if we are not able to land here, then we will have to land in the water but such a miracle happened, such a miracle happened that suddenly the lights of the runway of Dubai turn on.  A message comes from Dubai officers saying okay, you can land here.  After this, the pilot B K Mehta, while shouting and dancing with joy, said God bless you, God bless your country.  You helped us a lot and this is a big thing because friends, it is said that only 5 minutes of fuel was left.  A water landing would have been necessary.  Well here finally this plane lands in Dubai and by now it had been about 22 hours since it was hijacked.

The plane landed in Dubai at around 4:50 according to Dubai local time.  And meanwhile it is also said that Anita Singh, the senior airstice person in the flight, also knew this and the captain also knew that when this plane took off from Lahore.  Only after this, an aircraft of our Indian Air Force, which was an aircraft relief aircraft of Indian Airlines, went after this hijack pen.  There was relief equipment in the aircraft , there were people, there were doctors, there was a medical team.  Commandos were also there. From here onwards, the entire hijack team was behind this plane to take over it. Whether it was going to Bahrain or else it was going to Dubai.  So, when this hijacked plane landed in Dubai, our aircraft, which was a relief aircraft, also landed behind it.   By this time the hijackers had completely understood that they did not have many options left.  The time for negotiations has arrived. Negotiations will have to be done.  But it was seen in Dubai that Kamaljeet Singh Sadhu, who was a hijacker, was the main hijacker and with him there was another hijacker whose name was said to be Monty.  Nick was calling him Monty. Both of them were still continuously demanding to go from Dubai to US or London. But later it was explained to them that you cannot go from the US, from the UAE, from Dubai, you cannot go out here. Some more High Jackers were mentioned in later statements by the air hostesses, including that there was an High Jacker named Kiss.  He looked 15 years old but was actually 22 years old. He gave a postcard to an air hostess Urvashi to send it to his home.   I wrote it on it.  But later, God knows what came into his mind that he tore the postcard himself and ate the paper.  So these kinds of things also happened.  There was a hijacker named Amarinder Singh. He threatened the pilots that if any trouble occurs, I will kill you all.   The work of intimidation was being done by Amarinder Singh. Well, now the phase of negotiations has begun. Currently the Defense Minister of UAE who is also the Prime Minister of UAE today. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.  So Sheikh Mohammed bin bin Rashid Al Maktoum is said to have been out at that time. He was not in Dubai.  He suddenly reaches Dubai. He took the negotiations in his own hands and said that negotiations would be done with these people.  Ok ?  Came forward and it was a very good thing. India's ambassador to Dubai at that time, Ishrat Aziz, was also there.  Former Foreign Secretary Domesh Bhandari also reached there. Well, apart from this, Indian Minister of State for External Affairs A Rahim was in Qatar at that time.  They were going to Qatar and had to stop over in Dubai and suddenly at this time this hijacked plane landed in Dubai. So they also reach the airport directly. Now the phase of negotiation has started which is critical because you all know the situation of negotiation.   The hijackers were continuously threatening that if our demands were not met then we would die.   The demand is that we have to go to the US. If we are taken there, we want political asylum and all these things.  If they do not agree then we will kill people one by one.  Well at this time, another very important person who was present inside this plane, in this hijacked plane from the very beginning, was K. Subramaniam.  K. Subrahmanyam, the father of our present Minister of Defence Affairs S. Jaishankar Sahib, was at that time the Director of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA).  So, a very notable personality was on that plane and somehow the hijackers came to know about this.  So it was seen that Suddenly K Subramanyam was diabetic.  It had been a long journey for them.  It had been more than a day since the hijacking. So he needed a lot of insulin shots.  There was an instant need.   There was urgency.  So it was seen that when this was further informed by the hijackers to the UAE ATC, Dubai ATC.  So finally two ambulances suddenly arrive outside the hijacked plane.  They are given insulin.  But later, taking them as a target, these hijackers targeted basically India that we will start killing people one by one and do all these things.  If our demands are not met.  So anyway while the plane was parked here Subramaniam was given insulin shots. After this he became normal. Brought back to the plane.  After a while, the food and water finally arrived inside the plane. Meanwhile, the hijackers were continuously making the passengers raise slogans of Khaistan Zindabad and Bindra Wale Zindabad.  They were also making the passengers raise slogans, and the hijackers, one after the other, sometimes started threatening them.  Meanwhile, another thing was seen that a hijacker was swept away so much in the flow of water. A funny, ridiculous, comedy scene was created there where he said 'Down with Pakistan'.  Suddenly as soon as he said 'Pakistan Murdabad', the hijackers around him got angry seeing him. So then he said Pakistan Zindabad and all such things were said there.  Well, ultimately all these IJKers understood that the negotiations would have to be done with the UAE authorities and with the Indian officers.  You will have to agree with his words also.  But this initial negotiation went on for about 14 hours and first two hijackers came out.  Used to come to ATC and talk.  There, UAE officers were interacting with the UAE officers including the Defence Minister of that time, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.  Used to talk to A Rahim of India. So all these things happened.   After some time other hijackers would come again.  He would come again.  But these negotiations lasted for about 14 hours.  At 5:30 in the evening, suddenly a proper final ultimatum was given to the hijackers and then at 6:50 it was reported that the hijackers were promised asylum in the US. Basically, we were told that we should be taken to the US as they had been demanding for a long time. Asylum should be given in the US, political asylum should be given.  After this, the demands of the passengers were accepted because apart from this they could not do anything else here.  Passengers then saw buses belonging to the Dubai National Airlines Transport authorities parked near the fire and within 10 minutes, at around 7:00 pm, the UAE authorities moved in to finally evacuate the 75 passengers and six crew members from the plane. Everyone was then taken to the air-conditioned transit lunch. There they were given rest and refreshment.  The hijackers were taken away in a bait van.  UAE basically gave only two options to these hijackers during the negotiations by the Indian and UAE authorities.  He had said that either you should face the trial under the law that exists in UAE. Here you will always have the threat of death penalty.   The second thing is that you go back to India. Go back to India.  Face trial there. In this you must be seeing that the promise of giving political asylum to go to the US was made earlier.  They were basically fooled by UAE. Because the US envoy of that time had clearly refused that you can say this but if you send them and if this drama of yours continues further that you will get political asylum for the hijackers in the US, then if you do this, we will not give them asylum but as soon as they set foot on US soil, they will be arrested, so anyway this thing was also told to the hijackers that the US has already refused, has rejected your request for political asylum, so the hijackers finally chose the option of going to India and after this they were brought to India, the UAE authorities also gave the German pistol to the CBI, these hijackers were handed over to them, the rescued passengers and finally the crew members were brought to India, from UAE to Delhi, the hijackers reached Chandigarh on 2 September 1984, they were taken to Chandigarh, from there they were brought to Delhi, they were kept in the joint custody of CBI and IB, anti-terrorism charges were imposed on them Under section four and five of the Hijacking Act 198 (1982), section 120B of IPC, criminal conspiracy, now it is the Indian Judicial Code (BNS) IPC, apart from this, charge of 506 criminal intimidation was imposed, under PC Gupta, the magistrate in Chandigarh, he gave his custody for 19 days to the police, he was kept on police remand, after 19 days, the investigation in Delhi continued, after this it was seen that the hearing in the special court of Ajmer, which was conducted under Justice R K Jain, 87 witnesses, around 500 documents were before them, they were examined, a very big statement of K Subramaniam sahab, father of S Jaishankar, K Subramaniam, means all his statements were such that he was a witness here.  In the final judgment of 415 pages, the pistol which was recovered from Lahore was also mentioned and it was made a major point and finally all the seven hijackers were sentenced to life imprisonment. Sentenced to life imprisonment.  But one big thing that was seen was that in 1999, when the Kandar hijacking of IC814 took place, at that time all these hijackers were released. That means the Khaastanis who were separatists were also left there along with the rest of Masood Azar, Umar Shad Sheikh and all others. So these seven were also released here and in the meantime it was told that either this was some internal dealing of ISI which happened in the negotiations that took place in Kandahar or apart from this, at that time many such prisoners were released from Indian jails and under that all of them were released.  So, this was one such hijacking of IC421 aircraft of Indian Airlines in which a very big role of Pakistan came to light and in fact the role of ISI, let me tell you that between 1981 and 1984, a lot of hijackings took place which were carried out by Christian separatists.  The role of ISI came to light in all these.  And in fact, between 1971 and 1999, Indian Airlines was the only good airline in India that was operating aircraft.   It was a domestic airline.  It is said that around 16 hijacking incidents have taken place. From 71 to 1999.  There were 16 hijacking incidents and ISI was found suspected in all of them. So friends, this was today's episode.
