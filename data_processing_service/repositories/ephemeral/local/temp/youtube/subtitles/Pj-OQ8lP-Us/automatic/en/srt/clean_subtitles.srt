I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  I have taken so many lectures, countless lectures on Israel and Iran. But friends, what impact will it have on India? We have talked about this before.  But this time things are different.  This time Israel has not attacked Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis etc.  He launched a direct attack on Iran and its repercussions will be huge. So we will know one by one and I will keep explaining all the things to you.  Everything from history to the present and what is going to happen next. So the three actors are Israel, Iran and the world.  The world is on one side.  On one side is Israel and on the other side is Iran. Iran is the world between Israel.  And now the distance between the worlds that the wall had created has ended.  He has broken it completely. Israel has said that uproot whatever needs to be uprooted.  Do whatever you want to do.  Told America to uproot him and run away.  I will kill you. And Iran said, kill us, we will also kill them. We will kill twice as much as you kill. 200 aircraft, 200 200 aircraft have been sent by Israel.  Now it is not known whether they have gone from Israel or the remaining air bases that have been built have gone from Iraq and Jordan. Those made by America.  Apart from that, Musad is also active.  We will attack from air, from sea and from ground.  But you will say, Sir, it does not seem like a border.  So how will the ground forces operate?  How can you enter Iran?  M This is what it means to carry out a coup. M This is oil extraction.  And this is three Aim.  A coup in Iran, second control of oil, control of energy and most importantly, ending the nuclear program.  For Israel, it is a matter of survival.  Do you understand? For Israel, it is a matter of survival. Israel knows that if anyone around us acquires nuclear power, we will not survive.  Because historically, for the last 2.5-3 thousand years, there has been enmity between Israel, that is the Jews, and everyone else, so we are not going to escape.  This is absolutely certain. Talking about Iran, the people of West Asia are amazing.  Iran Syria are very nice people.  I have great respect for India. Such wonderful hospitality, the people of Iran are very nice.  Iran has very good relations with India. And so with Israel. India has the best even from Israel.  Israel always stands in good stead of India.  But India does not do that.  India acts diplomatically.  Even now India has supported both the countries. So anyway, India does not have any choice because India is non-aligned. India is the only country in the whole world which is not with anyone and which has many advantages as well as disadvantages. Both things are there.  Because when the time comes, no one will stand with us.  So at this point, both countries are at war.  In fact, this started from the day before yesterday.  On the other hand, Israel attacked Iran.  Iran immediately attacked.  Israel attacked Iran with 200 aircraft.  Their Natanj site, Fardok, which is their nuclear site, was destroyed.  Now look now, because it is nuclear, 60% to 70% they have reached nuclear enrichment.  90% of nuclear enrichment is done by centrifuge churning.  Just like you extract butter, similarly by churning uranium, uranium is extracted in its purest form so that it can be used for nuclear energy and in nuclear bombs.   Are you understanding?  And the beginning of all this was, look at the state of hormones, we will talk about all this now. All this started from February.  Just in February this year, America said that enough is enough with Iran.  Sorry for the fight. Come, let's sit at the table.  So at that time Israel said that no no Israel means in a way the leader or Don Trump has got into a fight. Donald Trump needs money, brother.  So Netan Yahoo said, brother, this will not work.  Hey, what are you doing? If you negotiate with Iran then we are finished. So Donald Trump said, it doesn't matter, no one went to work.  Everyone will share and eat.  The conversation continued.  At that time, Iran also indicated that by March, we are ready to talk to you.  The talks took place in Doha.  The talks took place in Qatar.  Negotiations continued for two months.  The sixth round of talks was scheduled to take place on 16 June. Steve Witkoff was scheduled to meet.  What the discussions were going to be was that you should stop your nuclear enrichment because the IAEA had said that Iran is not following the NPT and will make a nuclear bomb very soon.  It was even said that it can make 15 nuclear bombs in the next 15 days.  Iran has got so much power now and if their nuclear program is not stopped then the game is over.  So there is a threat to Israel's survival.  What happened earlier in Iraq ?  It was revealed in Iraq that Iraq was making a nuclear bomb. When Saddam Hussein was in power, when this became known, Israel had attacked at that time too. America doesn't get its hands dirty.  He gets it done from Israel.  And Israel does this. Why does he do this?  Because Israel knows this.  Israel's interest is that nuclear bomb means we are gone. Because then everybody will climb on top of us. Like Pakistan always gives nuclear threats to India. Well these people will threaten us and then we will lose the dominance that we have built with so much difficulty.  America's interest and its bases are established there, and it is obvious that America can also get threatened with the nuclear bomb because the regime in West Asia is anti-America.  It is anti-Israel.  Israel has technology, so because of that Israel can do anything.  He thinks that as long as we are technically superior. We can do anything that he is already doing. He will bomb Syria.  He will bomb Iraq.  You can uproot whatever you want to uproot.  You're off, I have a gun. You have a sword.  Fight it.  You keep wielding the sword, we will kill you with the gun. That is the situation at present.  But the day Iran also gets guns, which has already happened.  It is almost here, there will be a problem that day.  So Mossad is active and Mossad is continuously telling Israel that Sir, the nuclear bomb has been made, now see.  But you should take Chanakya Niti because finally we are going to end the Coupon Code Policy 70. Acharya Chanakya has already told all this.  Total 10: There are around 600 verses of this.  I have told you everything.  History and everything is covered.   There are 10 chapters. Link given in description comment box.  The course costs just â‚¹300. So Niti 70 coupon code will be used.  And yesterday, today and tomorrow we've got a sale going on.  Then finally tomorrow we will turn off the coupon code.  Now you see this.  This is your Iran.  Leave this. I will make a nice map for you.  I think it must have been installed. Wait 1 minute.  If anyone says yes that's great. Ok?  Come on, look at this map.  Isn't it? You should understand one thing in this map that you are seeing. What do you want to understand?  First you see why Iran is so important?  Look, Reza Dynasty, before that Pallavi, all the dynasties that have come.  Ok? She has been pro-America in Iran.  Ok ?  I covered the entire history of what happened in the last 200 years. I will not go into that right now.  That is a different lecture. I will give you its link in the description. So she has been pro America. Earlier it was under British control.  Britain used to control this dynasty for oil and there have always been protests here against outside powers.  But because it has been delivered to the people by the governments in collaboration with the British.  The first oil well in the world was dug in Iran. So energy was going to be the future. It became clear during World War One that in the future, only oil and gas would be sufficient. Now, after 1945, a lot of oil wells and everything else were found here. Now after this we see that British and American companies started coming here and took control of these oil wells. Well, the people here stood up saying that this is our external force.  They are exploiting us and we are not getting anything.  It was supported by Ayatollah Khomeini, who was expelled from Iran. Riza Pallavi said get out of here.  He used to give speeches from outside and his tapes were smuggled here. People understood that America was making huge gains from us.  Now see what has happened in West Asia till now, everything means Iran is supplying oil to the whole world. American companies are British companies. But then there was a revolution in 1979. And as soon as there was a revolution in Iran in 1979, a coup took place.  A theocracy came into being here.  This became a religious state. Ok?  And not yet the US Embassy. I tell myself a movie. Argo is a Ben Affleck movie.  You should watch this movie. Ok?  I have read his book as well. Now you will not read this book because of this movie.  I know.  So that's why I told you about Argoy's movie.  It 's a 2 hour movie.  Your breath will stop.  In 1979 there was a major hostage crisis.  The embassy was attacked here.  Iran had attacked the American Embassy. So how the people here ran away to save their lives, what kind of drama was enacted in the film, all that has been shown in this movie and it is based on the real story.  Ok?  So in 1979, the situation had become such that even the embassy was not left alone.  There was so much anti- American anger towards Britain for the last 100-150 years and from then till now the situation is such that there is no talk between America and Iran. Now see, America wants oil here. Israel also needs oil.  And oil wells are continuously being found here in Iran. And what Iran has done now, from 1980 to 1990, Iran came to know that first of all, create an IRGC, create a Revolutionary Guard, okay? After that create Houthis and Hezbollah, surround Israel and America. This State of Hormos, you are seeing, is okay. And where has this Gulf of Aden gone? These two places, this Gulf of Aden and this State of Hormos, are two very big points, oil is found here and 20% of the world's oil comes from here. Ok?  Here in Iran, this entire area belongs to Iran.  Ok?  This entire area that you are seeing belongs to Iran. Well Iran has created an access of resistance. It all goes from here.  This whole thing goes all the way up to Israel. To Europe.  In fact, Iraq is the closest to all the countries.  Next to it is Syria.  He has built corridors till there. Corridors have been maintained.  So even though Iran does not have a direct border with Israel, you have to understand that it has taken Iran along with itself and from there through Iraq, through Sudhar it reaches up to Israel. Similarly, America also has bases here. America has established bases everywhere here in Iraq.  Is it okay? America calls it Access of Evil and Israel calls it Access of Resistance, Iran calls it Access of Resistance.  Ok?  So this could be a direct fight.  There is no doubt about this. But what has happened in the last two years that who has become very weak? Iran.  How?  Iran indirectly supports Hamas. Israel has nearly destroyed Hamas.  Hezbollah was weakened considerably.  The Houthis have been weakened considerably.  Iran does not want war but Israel has left it with no choice.  Brother, I killed the Army Chief. Mohammed Bakari was killed. Hussain Salami was killed here.  You can understand that your elite forces and your present forces were all killed.  Brother, Bakari was very important. Mohammed Bakhri.  He used to take part in all the diplomatic missions. He was the president of their reserve and active army. He was the chief, he was killed, 78 people were killed.  They killed many big scientists.  So Iran said that now we will not leave.  And that is why Iran launched the missiles.  But I have just explained the complete geopolitics of this to you. But what is its effect going to be now?  This will have the biggest impact on India.  How?  Let us know each one by one. So, the first impact on India will be that, brother, the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman are maritime passages.  The whole world will be affected the same way.  And here in this entire region of global energy supply instability, Iran and Israel have placed their stooges here. Everywhere in this Gulf region, the Gulf region is sandwiched between Israel and Iran and if there is a crisis in it, then more than half of the world's energy supply will be lost. Brent oil has just gone up 10%.  So the oil prices will increase very fast and in India the oil may cost up to â‚¹ 140-150 per liter. India's oil will be extracted.  So this energy supply situation will become very bad for India. So all prices are there and once the all prices oil prices go up then inflation will increase.  Everything is related to oil.  The entire supply chain of India is facing a big problem regarding the supply chain.  Brother, look, India has a great opportunity at this time to control the supply chain.  Now, India is facing the Russia-Ukraine war because of which Europe is not able to invest in India and we are trying to control the supply chain in West Asia as well. After that, around 1 crore people from India work in the Gulf region. Work in Israel.  War means these people are also going to be in direct danger.  A huge danger is about to happen.  Do you understand?  So if this State of Hormos and the Gulf of Aden get blocked that could happen. Now you see how many millions per day, this is the figure of 2016.  Everywhere you look the State of Hormos has become a Turkish state. Now the maximum number of 19 goes from the State of Hormos and here a lot more also goes from Bal al Mandep and the Swiss Canal. And here you have 16 million from the State of Malacca, 16 million from the Cape of Goods, and a good amount from the Gulf of Aden. So in a way you can simply assume that the oil supply will be done and you see this entire region, Iran here, Israel here, this entire region, this energy region will be in danger and if it comes in danger then a huge energy crisis will arise in the entire world which is already going on due to the Russia-Ukraine war.  Is it okay? Now here Julius Baer explains that geopolitics is back. This is the biggest strike carried out by the Israeli military against Iran. Meaning you can assume that since the revolution in Iran a direct strike has not been carried out on such a big level because they directly attacked Teran.  This is Israel's biggest strike on Iran since 1979.  So let us assume that this war has started.  Now will this be a regional conflict?  It may or may not be so.  It is possible that within three-four days a missile may be fired from there or a missile may be fired from here and the matter may calm down. But this does not seem to be happening because Iran knows that as long as Israel exists, we will never be able to create our own nuclear program. So let's settle the matter once and for all. Whatever happens will be seen.  Well, there are many problems inside Iran too. Israel and America want a coup in Iran.  There is a huge problem of inflation in Iran.  There have been many human rights violations in Iran recently.  Bahsana Aamini's protest has not cooled down yet. So there are a lot of problems inside Iran too.  It is obvious that the world and America's CIA OSAD would want to take advantage of this.  Is it okay?  So broader escalation may happen in the region and oil sector will face the most problems.  Is it okay?  So now in the coming times, things will become clear in the next one week. Now, it is obvious that India's energy vulnerability, as I said, will be in trouble because 2/3rd of our imports, which is 66%, and half of the LAG (liquefied natural gas) comes from here, from the State of Hormost, and Iran will block it.  This is the entire region of Iran.  Hoteez is sitting here. Hezbollah is sitting there.  Is it okay ?  So, one can easily block it.  So if there is disruption here then India will have to turn to alternative sources.   Will have to go towards the roots.  Now because of that there will be higher costs and there will be logistical challenges. Because of which prices may increase here also.  Then after that, because of the supply chain destruction, as we said, India will have to move towards diversified energy sources and we have oil reserves. We have kept strategic reserves in case of emergency.  Whenever any such problem arises in any country, it has oil reserves which we can keep in reserve just like the foreign exchange reserves so that if any problem arises, we may have to empty it to control inflation.  But for how long is it a matter of how long?  So that is why India said that you should deescalate this immediately.  Ok? After that, there is the inflation risk as I said because oil prices are directly related to inflation.  Then friends one more very big thing can happen that what is there here, I do n't know about this friend, for today it is okay, no problem, I will tell you like this.  One problem is that it is being said here that the oil prices can go up to Rs 210 per barrel.  If the conflict escalates, it could cause problems in India's current account deficit. Our deficit may increase and then there will be operational costs and shipping costs. All that, then many of the Indian companies are operating here. Many people do not know that Indians dominate Africa. All the big companies are run by India and their money is India. Even though we are only 1.5 crore in America in the whole world, we still have the money from there.  The money there and the intellectual power of India are amazing.  It is unfortunate that we are not able to stop brain drain in our own country. India which was the centre of knowledge is now going away. But there is no doubt that no matter where you go in West Asia, if Indians control it, they too will be directly at risk, they too will be at risk, after that, friends, our IMEC, Middle East Economic Corridor, which we are building as a counter to CPEC, we had thought last September that it will be in danger, it will be in a huge danger, so three or four things have happened right here, firstly so many people live there, our company and then our IMEC, which is very important. He has already been in danger ever since this war between Israel and Hamas started. But now let us assume that we should forget it.  Then Israel will strike and Israel 's strike will not happen after seeing it.  He will kill him wherever he finds him.  And we are building Chabahar Port.  Chabahar port is already operational, friends.  So, at Chabahar and after that, the Dilaram railway line that we are building is also going to have a huge impact.  We had thought that if we make a complete route from Afghanistan through Iran, that would become a huge, huge problem.  Is it okay?  This is the thing and after that if the industry is dependent on raw material then the cost may increase because of that.  There can be a huge increase.  So the broader implication is huge and can create huge problems for India and the entire world. Then a huge diplomatic problem will arise for India. Look, how long will you do this?  You will have to take someone's support at some point or the other. Now Israel has supported you all the time. Iran did not support the Pahalgam attack. Ok?  Is.  I believe that Iranian people are very nice.  These are very good.   I have great respect for India.  The entire West Asia.  You go to Jordan. People there are crazy about Shahrukh Khan and Bollywood.   Is it okay?  It is our own Bollywood industry. Hollywood ruined it all. England's domination of Europe.  But our Bollywood industry is still standing. It directly competes with Hollywood which is the entire Indian film industry.  So people are crazy.  But the big thing is that Iran has not supported us diplomatically.  are you understand?  Not supported yet. Iran did not give direct support even in the Pahalgam attack.  Israel did it for us.  Israel openly supported it. France openly supported.  So Israel has always stood with you.  But India again the same because India, I just told you the factors that yes deescalation should happen. Now the problem that will arise for India is whom to support. We have a historical relationship with Iran. From oil to human to human contact has been there since a long time. From the Mesopotamian civilization till now, our relations with Israel have been very good. India has started supporting openly.  Then diplomatic problems will arise again and the whole world will be divided into two groups because Russia and China are openly supporting Iran and on the other side there is America and India will have to make a choice in this too. So the whole world is scared right now, friends.  A huge energy crisis could loom.  But you will overcome all crises. You should avail the course of Chanakya Niti.  Description link is in the comment box.  Whatever happens next will be seen, friend.  Ok.  Maybe the matter will calm down. Like it always happens and it is possible that the matter may escalate.  But this is a direct war.  You should assume this.  Although both the countries have not announced it yet and in today's times no one announces that we are at war.  This becomes more dangerous. Be happy, keep reading.  Siddh signing off from here.
