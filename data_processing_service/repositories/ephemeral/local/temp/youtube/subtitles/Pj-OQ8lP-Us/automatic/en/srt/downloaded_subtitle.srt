1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,160
I hope you all are doing very well.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,080
My name is Siddhant Agnihotri.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Welcome to Study Gloss.  I have

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,519
taken so many lectures,

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,720
countless lectures on Israel and Iran.

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,320
But friends, what impact will it have on India?

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,600
We have talked about this before.  But

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,880
this time things are different.  This time Israel has

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,720

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,439
not attacked Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis etc.  He launched a direct attack

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,760
on Iran and its repercussions will be huge.

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,760
So we will know one by one and

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,399
I will keep explaining all the things to you.  Everything from history to the

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,680
present and what is going to happen next.

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:44,800
So the three actors are Israel, Iran and the

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,840
world.  The world is on one side.  On

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,160
one side is Israel and on the other side is Iran.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,000
Iran is the world between Israel.  And now the

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,360
distance between the worlds that the wall had

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,199
created has ended.  He has broken it completely.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,640
Israel has said that uproot whatever needs to be uprooted.  Do

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,280
whatever you want to do.  Told America to uproot him and run

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,199
away.  I will kill you.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,200
And Iran said, kill us, we will also kill them.

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,960
We will kill twice as much as you kill.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,799
200 aircraft, 200 200 aircraft have been

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,799
sent by Israel.  Now it is not known whether they have gone from

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,200
Israel or the remaining air bases that have been

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,640
built have gone from Iraq and Jordan.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,400
Those made by America.  Apart from that, Musad

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,320
is also active.  We will attack from air, from sea

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,640
and from ground.  But you will

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,799
say, Sir, it does not seem like a border.  So

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,360
how will the ground forces operate?  How can you

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,159
enter Iran?  M This is what it means to carry out a coup.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,439
M This is oil extraction.  And this

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,079
is three Aim.  A coup in Iran, second

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,880
control of oil, control of energy and most

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,000
importantly,

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,880
ending the nuclear program.  For Israel, it

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
is a matter of survival.  Do you understand?

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,200
For Israel, it is a matter of survival.

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,280
Israel knows that if anyone around us acquires

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,320
nuclear power,

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,439
we will not survive.  Because historically, for the

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,159
last 2.5-3 thousand years, there has been enmity between

47
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,239
Israel, that is the Jews, and everyone else, so

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,720
we are not going to escape.  This is absolutely certain.

49
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,440
Talking about Iran, the

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
people of West Asia are amazing.  Iran Syria are very nice

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,920
people.  I have great respect for India.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,480
Such wonderful hospitality, the people

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,200
of Iran are very nice.  Iran has very good relations with India.

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,360
And so with Israel.

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,440
India has the best even from Israel.  Israel always

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,920
stands in good stead of India.  But

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,000
India does not do that.  India

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
acts diplomatically.  Even now India has supported both the countries.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,319
So anyway, India does not have any choice

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,239
because India is non-aligned.

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,239
India is the only country in the whole world

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
which is not with anyone and which has

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,160
many advantages as well as disadvantages.

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,720
Both things are there.  Because when the time comes, no

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,280
one will stand with us.  So at

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,599
this point, both countries are at war.  In fact,

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,920
this started from the day before yesterday.  On the other hand, Israel

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,760
attacked Iran.  Iran immediately

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,239
attacked.  Israel

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,879
attacked Iran with 200 aircraft.  Their Natanj

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,200
site, Fardok, which is their nuclear site, was

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,000
destroyed.  Now look now, because it

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,720
is nuclear, 60% to 70% they have

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,200
reached nuclear enrichment.  90% of nuclear

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
enrichment is done by centrifuge churning.  Just like

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,000
you extract butter, similarly by churning

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,599
uranium,

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
uranium is extracted in its purest form so that

80
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,640
it can be used for nuclear energy and in nuclear

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,440
bombs.   Are

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,920
you understanding?  And the beginning of all this was,

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,080
look at the state of hormones, we will talk about all this now.

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,319
All this started

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
from February.  Just in February this year, America said

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,560
that enough is enough with Iran.  Sorry for the fight.

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,720
Come, let's sit at the table.  So at that time

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
Israel said that no no Israel means in

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,080
a way the leader or Don Trump has got into a fight.

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,080
Donald Trump needs money, brother.  So

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,480
Netan Yahoo said, brother, this will

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,319
not work.  Hey, what are you doing?

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,280
If you negotiate with Iran then we are finished.

94
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,799
So Donald Trump said, it doesn't

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,080
matter, no one went to work.  Everyone will

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,840
share and eat.  The conversation continued.  At that time,

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,879
Iran also indicated that by March, we are

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,000
ready to talk to you.  The

99
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,519
talks took place in Doha.  The talks took place in Qatar.  Negotiations continued for two months.  The

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,920
sixth round of talks was scheduled to take place on 16 June.

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,320
Steve Witkoff was scheduled to meet.  What the

102
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,560
discussions were going to be was that you should

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,800
stop your nuclear enrichment

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,680
because the IAEA had said that

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,479
Iran is not following the NPT and will

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,199
make a nuclear bomb very soon.  It was even

107
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,440
said that it can make 15 nuclear bombs

108
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
in the next 15 days.  Iran has got so much power

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
now and if their

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,639
nuclear program is not stopped then the game is

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,759
over.  So there is a threat to Israel's

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,120
survival.  What happened earlier in Iraq

113
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,320
?  It was revealed in Iraq that Iraq was

114
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,040
making a nuclear bomb.

115
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,639
When Saddam Hussein was in power, when this became known,

116
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,320
Israel had attacked at that time too.

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,240
America doesn't get its hands dirty.  He

118
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,479
gets it done from Israel.  And Israel does this.

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,160
Why does he do this?  Because Israel

120
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
knows this.  Israel's interest is

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,320
that nuclear bomb means we are gone.

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
Because then everybody will climb on top of us.

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,400
Like Pakistan always gives nuclear threats to India.

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,400
Well these people will threaten us

125
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
and then we will lose the dominance that we have

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,080
built with so much difficulty.  America's

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
interest and its bases are established there,

128
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,600
and it is obvious that

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
America can also get threatened with the nuclear bomb

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,039
because the regime in West Asia is

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,479
anti-America.  It is anti-Israel.  Israel has

132
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,080
technology, so because of that

133
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,759
Israel can do anything.  He

134
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
thinks that as long as we are technically superior.

135
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
We can do anything that he is already doing.

136
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,759
He will bomb Syria.  He

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
will bomb Iraq.  You can

138
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,720
uproot whatever you want to uproot.  You're off, I have a gun.

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,039
You have a sword.  Fight it.  You

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,680
keep wielding the sword, we will kill you with the gun.

141
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,240
That is the situation at present.  But the day Iran also

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,039
gets guns, which has already happened.  It is almost here, there will be a

143
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,240
problem that day.  So

144
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,120
Mossad is active and Mossad is continuously telling

145
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,759
Israel that Sir, the

146
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,000
nuclear bomb has been made, now see.  But you should

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,320
take Chanakya Niti because finally we are going to

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,320
end the Coupon Code Policy 70.

149
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,800
Acharya Chanakya has already told all this.  Total

150
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,960
10: There are around 600 verses of this.  I have

151
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
told you everything.  History and everything is covered.   There

152
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
are 10 chapters.

153
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
Link given in description comment box.  The course costs just ₹300.

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,919
So Niti 70 coupon code will be used.  And

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,319
yesterday, today and tomorrow we've got a sale going on.  Then finally

156
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,960
tomorrow we will turn off the coupon code.  Now you

157
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,360
see this.  This is your Iran.  Leave this.

158
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,440
I will make a nice map

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,440
for you.  I think it must have been installed.

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,800
Wait 1 minute.  If anyone says yes that's great.

161
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,919
Ok?  Come on, look at this map.  Isn't it?

162
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,440
You should understand one thing in this map that you are seeing.

163
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,319
 

164
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,160
What do you want to understand?  First you see

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,080
why Iran is so important?  Look,

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,199
Reza Dynasty, before that Pallavi, all the

167
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,960
dynasties that have come.  Ok?

168
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,840
She has been pro-America in Iran.  Ok

169
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,600
?  I covered the entire history of what happened in the last 200 years.

170
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,600
I will

171
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,199
not go into that right now.  That is a different lecture.

172
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,080
I will give you its link in the description.

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,479
So she has been pro America.

174
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,039
Earlier it was under British control.  Britain used to

175
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,160
control this dynasty

176
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,520
for oil and there have always been

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
protests here against outside powers.  But

178
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,800
because it has been delivered to the people by the governments in

179
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,880
collaboration with the British.  The

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,440
first oil well in the world was dug in Iran.

181
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,599
So energy was going to be the future.

182
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,919
It became clear during World War One that in the

183
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,280
future, only oil and gas would be sufficient.

184
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,840
Now, after 1945,

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,160
a lot of oil wells and everything else were found here.

186
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,160
Now after this we see that British

187
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
and American companies started coming here

188
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,720
and took control of these oil wells.

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,400
Well, the people here stood up saying that

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
this is our external force.  They are

191
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
exploiting us and we are not

192
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,080
getting anything.  It was supported

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,840
by Ayatollah Khomeini, who was expelled from Iran.

194
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Riza Pallavi said get out

195
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,400
of here.  He used to give speeches from outside and his

196
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,479
tapes were smuggled here.

197
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
People understood that America was making

198
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,680
huge gains from us.  Now

199
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,440
see what has happened in West Asia till now, everything means Iran is

200
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,520
supplying oil to the whole world.

201
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
American companies are British companies.

202
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,479
But then there was a revolution in 1979.

203
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,680
And as soon as there was a revolution in Iran in 1979, a

204
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,400
coup took place.  A

205
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,199
theocracy came into being here.  This became a religious state.

206
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,879
Ok?  And not yet the US Embassy.

207
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,479
I tell myself a movie.

208
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,319
Argo

209
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,639
is a Ben Affleck movie.  You should watch this movie.

210
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,039
Ok?  I have read his book as well.

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
Now you will not read this book because of this movie.  I

212
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,680
know.  So that's why I told you about Argoy's movie.  It

213
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,120
's a 2 hour movie.  Your breath will

214
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,000
stop.  In 1979 there was a major hostage

215
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,399
crisis.  The embassy was

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
attacked here.  Iran had

217
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
attacked the American Embassy.

218
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,760
So how the people here

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,000
ran away to save their lives, what kind of drama was

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,120
enacted in the film, all that has been shown in this movie

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,760
and it is based on the real story.  Ok?  So

222
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,600
in 1979, the situation had become such that even the

223
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,080
embassy was not left alone.  There was so much anti-

224
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,720
American anger towards

225
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Britain for the last 100-150 years

226
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,720
and from then till now the situation is such that there is

227
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,959
no talk between America and Iran.

228
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
Now see, America wants oil here.

229
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,560
Israel also needs oil.  And

230
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,320
oil wells are continuously being found here in Iran.

231
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,600
 

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,160
And what Iran has done now,

233
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,720
from 1980 to 1990, Iran came to know that

234
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,120
first of all, create an IRGC, create a Revolutionary Guard,

235
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,880
okay? After that create Houthis and

236
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,720
Hezbollah, surround Israel and America.

237
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,440
This State of Hormos, you are seeing, is

238
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,120
okay. And where has this Gulf of Aden gone?

239
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,839
These two places, this Gulf of Aden

240
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,640
and this State of Hormos, are two very

241
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,800
big points, oil is found here and

242
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,680
20% of the world's oil comes from here.

243
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,080
Ok?  Here in Iran, this entire area belongs to

244
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,480
Iran.  Ok?  This

245
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,080
entire area that you are seeing belongs to Iran.

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,640
Well Iran has created an access of resistance.

247
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,320
It all goes from here.  This

248
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,360
whole thing goes all the way up to Israel.

249
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,399
To Europe.  In fact,

250
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,279
Iraq is the closest to all the countries.  Next to it

251
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,160
is Syria.  He has built corridors till there.

252
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,160
Corridors have been maintained.  So even though

253
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,880
Iran does not have a direct border

254
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,120
with Israel, you have to understand that

255
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,440
it has taken Iran along with itself

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
and from there through Iraq, through Sudhar

257
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,519
it reaches up to Israel.

258
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
Similarly, America also has bases here.

259
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,480
America has

260
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,839
established bases everywhere here in Iraq.  Is it okay?

261
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,920
America calls it Access of Evil and

262
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,560
Israel calls it Access of Resistance, Iran calls it Access

263
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,399
of Resistance.  Ok?  So this

264
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,880
could be a direct fight.  There is no doubt about this.

265
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:53,440
But what has happened in the last two years that

266
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:57,680
who has become very weak?

267
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,320
Iran.  How?  Iran indirectly supports Hamas.

268
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,560
Israel has nearly

269
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
destroyed Hamas.  Hezbollah was

270
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,720
weakened considerably.  The Houthis have been

271
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,800
weakened considerably.  Iran does not

272
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,600
want war but Israel has

273
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,440
left it with no choice.  Brother, I killed the Army Chief.

274
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,959
Mohammed Bakari was killed.

275
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,480
Hussain Salami was killed here.  You

276
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:25,279
can understand that your elite forces and your present

277
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,120
forces were all killed.  Brother,

278
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,839
Bakari was very important.

279
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,760
Mohammed Bakhri.  He used to

280
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,000
take part in all the diplomatic missions.

281
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,920
He was the president of their reserve and active army.

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,120
He was the chief, he was killed, 78

283
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
people were killed.  They killed many big

284
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,720
scientists.  So Iran said

285
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,279
that now we will not leave.  And that is why Iran

286
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,120
launched the missiles.  But

287
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,320
I have just explained the complete geopolitics of this to you.

288
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,200
But

289
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,640
what is its effect going to be now?  This

290
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,079
will have the biggest impact on India.  How?  Let us know each one by one.

291
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,560
So, the first

292
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,399
impact on India will be

293
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,519
that, brother, the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman are

294
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,880
maritime passages.  The whole world will be

295
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,680
affected the same way.  And here in

296
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,000
this entire region of global energy supply instability,

297
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,600
Iran and Israel have placed their stooges here.

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,920
Everywhere in this Gulf region, the Gulf

299
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,440
region is sandwiched between Israel and Iran

300
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,680
and if there is a crisis in it, then

301
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,720
more than half of the world's energy supply will be lost.

302
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,440
Brent oil has just gone up 10%.  So the

303
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,720
oil prices will increase very fast and

304
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,680
in India the oil may cost up to ₹ 140-150 per liter.

305
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,079
India's oil will be extracted.  So this

306
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,560
energy supply situation will become very bad for India.

307
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,320
So all prices are there and

308
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
once the all prices oil prices go up then

309
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,240
inflation will increase.  Everything

310
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
is related to oil.  The entire supply chain of India is facing a

311
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
big problem regarding the supply chain.  Brother, look,

312
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,639
India has a great opportunity at this time to

313
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,639
control the supply chain.  Now, India is facing the

314
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
Russia-Ukraine war because of which

315
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
Europe is not able to invest in India

316
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,160
and we are

317
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,600
trying to control the supply chain in West Asia as well.

318
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,440
After that, around 1

319
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,920
crore people from India work in the Gulf region.

320
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,800
Work in Israel.  War

321
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,920
means these people are also going to be in direct danger.  A

322
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,160
huge danger is about to happen.  Do you

323
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,320
understand?  So if this State of Hormos

324
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,800
and the Gulf of Aden get blocked that could happen.

325
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,839
Now you see how many millions per

326
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,839
day, this is the figure of 2016.  Everywhere

327
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,480
you look the State of Hormos has become a Turkish state.

328
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,240
Now the maximum number of 19 goes from the State of Hormos and

329
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
 

330
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,839
here a lot more also goes from Bal al Mandep and the Swiss Canal.

331
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,839
And here you have

332
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
16 million from the State of Malacca,

333
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,200
16 million from the Cape of Goods, and a good amount from the Gulf of Aden.

334
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,240
So in a way you can simply assume

335
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,560
that the oil supply will be done and you see this entire region,

336
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,720

337
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,120
Iran here, Israel here, this entire region, this

338
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,440
energy region will be in danger and

339
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,360
if it comes in danger then

340
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,760
a huge energy crisis will arise in the entire world

341
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,320
which is already going on

342
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,199
due to the Russia-Ukraine war.  Is it okay?

343
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,959
Now here Julius Baer explains that

344
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,040
geopolitics is back.

345
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,839
This is the biggest strike carried out by the Israeli military against Iran.

346
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,399
Meaning you can

347
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,399
assume that since the revolution in Iran a

348
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,079
direct strike has not been carried out on such a big level

349
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,120
because they directly attacked Teran.  This

350
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,680

351
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,160
is Israel's biggest strike on Iran since 1979.  So let us assume

352
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,079
that this war has started.  Now will

353
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,360
this be a regional conflict?  It may or may

354
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,800
not be so.  It is possible that within three-four days a

355
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
missile may be fired from there or a

356
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,959
missile may be fired from here and the matter may calm down.

357
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,199
But this does not seem to be happening because Iran

358
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,720
knows that as long as Israel exists, we will

359
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
never be able to create our own nuclear program.

360
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,959
So let's settle the matter once and for all.

361
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
Whatever happens will be seen.  Well, there are many

362
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,560
problems inside Iran too.

363
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,079
Israel and America want a coup in Iran.  There is a

364
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,320

365
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,399
huge problem of inflation in Iran.  There have been many

366
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,240
human rights violations in Iran recently.  Bahsana

367
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,560
Aamini's protest has not cooled down yet.

368
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,639
So there are a lot of problems inside Iran too.  It is

369
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,040
obvious that the world

370
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,360
and America's CIA OSAD would want to take advantage of this.  Is it

371
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,079
okay?  So broader

372
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,959
escalation may happen in the region

373
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,760
and oil sector will face the most problems.  Is it

374
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,920
okay?  So now

375
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,920
in the coming times, things will become clear in the next one week.

376
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,279
Now, it is obvious that India's energy vulnerability,

377
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,519
as I

378
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,880
said, will be in trouble because

379
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,839
2/3rd of our imports, which is 66%, and

380
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,360
half of the LAG (liquefied natural gas)

381
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,279
comes from here, from the State of Hormost,

382
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,720
and Iran will block it.  This

383
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,639
is the entire region of Iran.  Hoteez is sitting here.

384
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,040
Hezbollah is sitting there.  Is it okay

385
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,440
?  So, one can easily block it.  So

386
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,360
if there is disruption here then India will

387
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
have to turn to alternative sources.   Will

388
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,040
have to go towards the roots.  Now because of that there will be

389
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,199
higher costs and there will be logistical challenges.

390
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,480
Because of which prices

391
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,079
may increase here also.  Then after that, because of the supply

392
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
chain destruction, as we said,

393
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,399
India will have to move towards diversified energy sources

394
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,240
and we have oil reserves.

395
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,399
We have

396
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,160
kept strategic reserves in case of emergency.  Whenever

397
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,160
any such problem arises in any country, it has

398
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
oil reserves which we can keep in reserve just like the

399
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,079
foreign exchange reserves so that

400
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
if any problem arises,

401
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,160
we

402
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,160
may have to empty it to control inflation.  But for how long

403
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,399
is it a matter of how long?  So that is why India said that

404
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,399
you should deescalate this immediately.  Ok?

405
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,639
After that, there is the inflation risk as I

406
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,800
said because oil prices are

407
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,800
directly related to inflation.  Then

408
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,959
friends one more very big thing can happen

409
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,959
that what is there here, I do

410
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,680
n't know about this friend, for today it is okay, no problem,

411
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,680
I will tell you like this.  One problem is

412
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,720
that it is being said here that the

413
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,880
oil prices

414
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
can go up to Rs 210 per barrel.  If the conflict escalates, it could cause

415
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880

416
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,959
problems in India's current account deficit.

417
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Our deficit may increase and

418
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,120
then there will be operational costs and shipping costs.

419
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,039
All that, then many of the Indian

420
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,400
companies are operating here.

421
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
Many people do not know that

422
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,039
Indians dominate Africa.

423
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,280
All the big companies are run by India and their money is India.

424
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,360
Even though we are only 1.5 crore in America in the whole world,

425
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,679

426
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,439
we still have the money from there.  The money there and the

427
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,199
intellectual power of India are amazing.  It is

428
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,000
unfortunate that we are

429
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,039
not able to stop brain drain in our own country.

430
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,600
India which was the centre of knowledge is now going away.

431
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,520
But there is no doubt that no matter

432
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,160
where you go in West Asia, if Indians

433
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,440
control it, they too will be directly at

434
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,000
risk, they too will be at risk, after that, friends,

435
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,679
our IMEC,

436
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,799
Middle East Economic Corridor, which we are

437
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,200
building as a counter to CPEC,

438
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,400
we had thought last September that it will be in danger, it will be in a

439
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,840
huge danger, so

440
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,520
three or four things have happened right here, firstly

441
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,160
so many people live there, our company and then

442
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,000
our IMEC, which is very important.

443
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,919
He has already been in danger ever since

444
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,120
this war between Israel and Hamas started.

445
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,679
But now let us assume that we should forget it.  Then

446
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,919
Israel will strike and Israel

447
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,559
's strike will not happen after seeing it.  He will kill

448
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,720
him wherever he finds him.  And we are

449
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,520
building Chabahar Port.  Chabahar port

450
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,280
is already operational, friends.  So, at Chabahar and

451
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
after that, the Dilaram

452
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,679
railway line that we are building is also going to have a huge

453
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,360
impact.  We had thought that if we

454
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,240

455
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,000
make a complete route from Afghanistan through Iran, that would become a huge,

456
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,760
huge problem.  Is it okay?  This is the

457
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,919
thing and after that if the industry is

458
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,520
dependent on raw material then the cost may increase because of that.  There

459
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,440

460
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,160
can be a huge increase.  So the broader

461
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,000
implication is huge and can create huge

462
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,919
problems for India and the entire world.

463
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,760
Then a

464
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,799
huge diplomatic problem will arise for India.

465
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,080
Look, how long will you do this?  You will have to

466
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,559
take someone's support at some point or the other.

467
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,799
Now Israel has supported you all the time.

468
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,880
Iran did not support the Pahalgam attack.

469
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,480
Ok?  Is.  I believe that Iranian

470
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
people are very nice.  These are very good.   I have

471
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
great respect for India.  The entire

472
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,280
West Asia.  You go to Jordan.

473
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,360
People there are crazy about Shahrukh Khan and Bollywood.   Is it

474
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,360
okay?  It is our own Bollywood industry.

475
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,039
Hollywood ruined it all.

476
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,559
England's domination of Europe.  But

477
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,480
our Bollywood industry is still standing.

478
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,080
It directly competes with Hollywood which is the

479
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,559
entire Indian film industry.  So

480
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,679
people are crazy.  But the big thing is that

481
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,320
Iran has not supported us diplomatically.  are

482
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,640
you understand?  Not supported yet.

483
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,120
Iran did

484
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,919
not give direct support even in the Pahalgam attack.  Israel

485
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,960
did it for us.  Israel openly supported it.

486
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,600
France openly supported.  So Israel has

487
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,440
always stood with you.  But India

488
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,679
again the same because India, I just

489
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,080
told you the factors that yes deescalation should happen.

490
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,240
Now the problem that will arise for India is

491
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,440
whom to support.

492
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,679
We have a historical relationship with Iran.

493
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,520
From oil to human to human contact has been there

494
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,559
since a long time.

495
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,480
From the Mesopotamian civilization till now,

496
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,799
our relations with Israel have been very good.

497
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,400
India has started supporting openly.  Then diplomatic

498
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
problems will arise again and the whole world will be

499
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,600
divided into two groups because Russia and

500
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,559
China are openly supporting Iran

501
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,120
and on the other side there is America and India will have to make a choice in this too.

502
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,200
So the whole world is scared right now,

503
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,720
friends.  A huge energy

504
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,360
crisis could loom.  But you will

505
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,360
overcome all crises.

506
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,600
You should avail the course of Chanakya Niti.  Description

507
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
link is in the comment box.  Whatever happens next will be seen,

508
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,200
friend.  Ok.  Maybe the matter will calm down.

509
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,960
Like it always happens and it is

510
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
possible that the matter may escalate.  But this

511
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,640
is a direct war.  You should assume this.  Although

512
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,159
both the countries have not announced it yet and in today's

513
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,159
times no one announces that we are at

514
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,080
war.  This becomes more dangerous.

515
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,400
Be happy, keep reading.  Siddh signing off from here.

516
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,400
