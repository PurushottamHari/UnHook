hardtalk i'm stephen sacca the eu is

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,240
thought to have lost more than 10

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,200
billion euros to fraud over the last two

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,279
decades

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
and yet it's anti-fraud and corruption

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
agencies have long

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
lacked the teeth to root out the problem

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,880
could that

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,720
be about to change well my guest is

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,080
romanian lara kovaci

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,280
the eu's first public prosecutor she has

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,160
enhanced powers to tackle transnational

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,440
crime

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:44,970
but if member states refuse to play ball

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:01:03,229
how can she succeed

17
00:00:44,970 --> 00:01:03,229
[Music]

hard talk

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,799
thank you very much for the invitation

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,000
you have had almost

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
a year since your appointment as the

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
eu's

24
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,159
first chief public prosecutor

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
you are trying to deal with a very

26
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,280
urgent problem that costs the eu

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,840
billions of euros what have you actually

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
done so far

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,880
i took my office in 1st of november and

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,040
i started to organize together

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,040
with the small team that i found here to

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
in the beginning the administrative

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,360
issues that are necessary

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,360
to start eppo is necessary to have the

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,360
european prosecutors

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,200
it's those prosecutors who will work

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
here with me in luxembourg

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
and also we need to have the european

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,360
delegated prosecutors

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,040
the european delegated prosecutor is

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,159
those prosecutors who will

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
work in their national member states

43
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,280
would you agree would you agree would

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,319
you agree with me that the problem is

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,840
indeed very

46
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,640
urgent we are talking about the role of

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,520
organized crime in siphoning off

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,040
billions of euros from the agricultural

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
funds the cohesion

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
funds right across the european union

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
some countries

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,720
are particularly bad and yet you're

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
telling me after nine months

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,920
you really haven't begun work yet you're

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,959
just working out your administration

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,599
yes it is necessary to have a bpo

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,319
but in order to to start working in the

58
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,360
cases

59
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,000
we need to build the new office

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,440
this means that we we need to have all

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
the internal regulation

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
we need to have all the prosecutors on

63
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,920
board

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,599
and it's not a decision that only one

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,560
person can take it's a

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,319
shared responsibility between the

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,879
european commission

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,519
european parliament the council and the

69
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,080
national

70
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,000
uh authorities of each member state

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
participating to the european public

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,040
prosecutor office

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,879
yeah did it worry you when you realized

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,599
that some of the team you were supposed

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,720
to lead

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,840
were going to be part-time and that your

77
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,800
total staffing appears to number some

78
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,080
40 to 50 in your central office and then

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,599
a bunch of

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,319
local prosecutors in member countries

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,599
who at least according to the commission

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,760
were going to be working part-time

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,000
well we speak here about the possibility

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,040
for prosecutors to work full-time and

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
part-time

86
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,879
my wish is to have only full-time

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,040
prosecutors this is

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,840
very important for their independence

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,440
for their efficiency for the

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,840
responsibility i cannot imagine how a

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,159
european delegate prosecutor can work

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
for

93
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,040
our story ppo and during the the

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,560
pleading in the trial he has to

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,959
uh to go and to continue his activity to

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
and to work for the national prosecutor

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
office this is the reason why

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,519
in my consultation with the member

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,400
states i insisted to have only full-time

100
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,760
prosecutors

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
right the fact that they were talking

102
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,319
about part-timers it may be it's

103
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
symptomatic

104
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,000
of a problem at the heart of the eu

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,519
which is they've never

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
really taken rooting out systematic

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,840
corruption seriously we can see that

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
over many years if we look at the scale

109
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,919
of the problem and the response from the

110
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,240
eu

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,240
and their in particular their european

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,960
anti-fraud office olaf

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,800
we see that time and again uh

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
investigations have been begun but

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
they've not

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
led to prosecutions it's a fundamental

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,360
problem isn't it

118
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
it is the european public prosecutor

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
will be the first

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,759
uh prosecutor office at the european

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,800
level what we will achieve with that

122
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,759
we will have a unitary approach related

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,320
to this phenomena and in the same time

124
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,639
we will

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,360
solve this issue related to the

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,800
discrepancies between the member states

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,880
of course in this period i evaluated

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,720
the statistics and i saw there are some

129
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,320
member states on which

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,440
we have hundreds of cases in each year

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,840
but also we have some member states

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,720
where

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,919
only two or nine investigations per per

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,160
year was uh

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,400
made by the prosecutors yeah

136
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,320
we will solve this issue to be blunt

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
about it miss kaveshi it's clear that

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,960
some member states

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,560
are absolutely not serious about using

140
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,440
the information that's been dug

141
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
up by the eu's anti-corruption

142
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,240
investigators again if one looks

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
at the current situation with this olaf

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,840
anti-fraud office at the eu

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,400
they launched 541

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,120
cases which they said should go to court

147
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,039
in fact

148
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,000
only 308 of them did 171 of those were

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,440
dismissed

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,840
and there were only 137

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
indictments in other words many member

152
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,919
states are

153
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,400
simply not interested in taking

154
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,680
seriously this problem

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,759
yes having eppo we will solve this issue

156
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,840
because we will have the same priorities

157
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,919
but it's important to

158
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,680
to make a small comment related to a

159
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,160
love and to explain

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
that until now olaf did only

161
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,440
administrative investigations

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,520
they did not make criminal investigation

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,639
only the prosecutor can do that

164
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,680
so eppo will be the only body at the

165
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,319
european level

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,440
who can make investigation we will have

167
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,600
prosecutors

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,759
we are all participating member states

169
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,639
and this is very important when we speak

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,400
about this phenomena especially related

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,440
to financial fraud

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,639
sometimes the prosecutor the law

173
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
informers

174
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,120
enforcement are not focused on this type

175
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,319
of criminality in the

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,440
same way in an equal way in all the

177
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,039
member states

178
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,759
eppo will change that so having

179
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,240
a highest number of investigation in

180
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,319
some member states or less in another

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
member states doesn't mean that we don't

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
have problems

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,039
you we we cannot speak about usual

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,440
suspects

185
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,800
when we speak about the financial fraud

186
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,880
there are problems in

187
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,039
all the member states and having tppo

188
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
at the national level in each

189
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,919
participating member states

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
we it will be very good because we can

191
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,199
increase the level of protection of the

192
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
european funds

193
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,440
and of course we will investigate better

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
all right efficiently

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,720
this kind of crimes well i think it's

196
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,639
worth reminding people when you talk

197
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,759
about the eppo you mean

198
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,759
the european public prosecutors office

199
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,280
exactly so that's what you're leading i

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,319
think it's fair to say you got the job

201
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,960
because of your

202
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,199
pretty remarkable track record in

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,000
romania during your time

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,199
leading the anti-corruption director in

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,280
your home country romania i see that you

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,360
led the campaign against a whole bunch

207
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,080
of senior politicians the

208
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,759
former prime minister mr nastasi was

209
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,479
convicted

210
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,120
of corruption offences during your term

211
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,520
14

212
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,199
former or current ministers 43

213
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,319
parliamentarians 260 local officials

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,879
all were subject to investigation during

215
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,759
your time in romania are you going to go

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,360
for the big beasts across europe now in

217
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,840
your new job

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,760
of course we will investigate financial

219
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,919
fraud we will investigate powerful

220
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,560
people but what is important to say

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,479
is what i did in romania and what i will

222
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,279
do here in eppo

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,080
i will not to be alone i will have the

224
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,160
entire team

225
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,560
with me and this is very important we

226
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,519
will be prosecutors of 22 different

227
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,320
member states

228
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,399
and we will put together our experience

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,600
our knowledge and we will investigate

230
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,680
better this uh

231
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,080
phenomena but the problem together with

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,760
them i wanted to do a good job

233
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,279
well we'll get we'll get to the 22

234
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,800
states and why it's not

235
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,040
uh more in a moment but just to focus on

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,000
romania and whether you really made a

237
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,920
difference

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,360
you you were a controversial figure you

239
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,120
certainly uh

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,800
took on some of the most powerful people

241
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
in your country but if one looks at the

242
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,880
state of romania when you left the job

243
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
and you were fired by the government

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,560
eventually

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,760
uh when you left transparency

246
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
international

247
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,080
thought that romania was actually

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,200
performing worse it ranked 70th in the

249
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,760
world in terms of

250
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
corruption index in 2019 it was going

251
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,680
backwards

252
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,160
it was the second most corrupt country

253
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,560
in

254
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,640
europe uh just uh outdone by bulgaria

255
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,399
it doesn't seem to be honest that

256
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,399
despite your best efforts you made much

257
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,360
difference

258
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,000
well when we speak about to eradicate

259
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
corruption

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,040
or to reduce the level of corruption in

261
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
one country

262
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
i think it's not the only responsibility

263
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
of prosecutors

264
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,040
to to fight with this phenomena it is

265
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,880
necessary to have

266
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,360
an entire effort also the prosecutors

267
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,839
also to prevent corruption also to to

268
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
have good laws and to offer the enough

269
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
to

270
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,480
offer enough instruments to the

271
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,200
prosecutors to investigate those crimes

272
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,640
it is important to say that also the

273
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,680
mentality

274
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,680
and the entire society can contribute to

275
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,480
to decrease the level of corruption in a

276
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
country so

277
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,519
not only arresting or investigating

278
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,079
people

279
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
we can solve the issue of corruption in

280
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,079
one member state but

281
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,000
what is important now is that we will

282
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,000
have the european public prosecutor

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,200
office of the european level

284
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,680
and we will use uh all the

285
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,240
legal instruments that we have and we

286
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
will work

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,880
better because we will have also here in

288
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,200
luxembourg

289
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,399
at the central level financial

290
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,519
investigation

291
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,079
investigators case analysts and together

292
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,200
we can

293
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,839
analyze you we can aggregate and put

294
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,680
together

295
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,279
all the dots when we speak about the

296
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,959
course the crimes

297
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,600
when we speak about corruption and

298
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,399
especially when we speak about financial

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
uh

300
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,360
criminal let me stop you a minute

301
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,640
because people across europe are going

302
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,760
to be interested in how you're going to

303
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,480
do the job

304
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,040
and it is indeed notable that you had a

305
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,680
certain reputation in romania for

306
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,000
uh let's say pushing the envelope in

307
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,480
terms of investigative practice

308
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,800
you it seems we're prepared to use the

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,760
intelligence services in a covert

310
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,000
fashion to dig dirt on some of the

311
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,279
suspects that you were going after

312
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and in the uh romanian constitutional

313
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,399
court some of your

314
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,200
methods were called into question do you

315
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,279
regret some of the methods you used

316
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
no it's not about the methods it's about

317
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,760
the working arrangement that we had

318
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
but at that moment based on the

319
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,160
legislation

320
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
we receive information from the secret

321
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
services

322
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,480
and we use those information to open the

323
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,120
cases

324
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,519
but it's important to say and to clarify

325
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
that

326
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,000
our investigations were made by the

327
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,120
prosecutors and by the police

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
officers and no one from the uh

329
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,800
officials from the service secret

330
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
service

331
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,920
did not work in our cases only the

332
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,000
prosecutors

333
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,079
to be honest with you police officers i

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,959
i'll be honest with you i i was very

335
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,040
struck by a former uh romanian prime

336
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,880
minister mr tariqanu

337
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,279
saying that under your watch the

338
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,240
anti-corruption agency

339
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,639
had not respected legal frameworks had

340
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,920
become

341
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,279
corrupt themselves and had become

342
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,839
a part of the political fight in romania

343
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,440
some critics called you

344
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,240
a part of securitate 2.0 because of your

345
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,160
cooperation with the security services

346
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
again i put it to you that if you bring

347
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,959
those methods to

348
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,720
your europe-wide prosecutor role

349
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,279
you're going to make many people very

350
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,279
unhappy

351
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,480
all our cases that we worked in romania

352
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,440
were checked and verified in the court

353
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,200
so at the european level we will work

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,320
according to the legislation

355
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
as i did it in romania all the time and

356
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,000
everything that

357
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,480
the prosecutors did in the cases were

358
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,560
checked

359
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,639
in the court by judges but with respect

360
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,760
to the constitutional the constitutional

361
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,639
court in january

362
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,560
uh 2019 concluded that you had created a

363
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,040
parallel justice system

364
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,639
existing outside the rules imposed by

365
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,639
romania's constitution

366
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
there is no any decision of

367
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,040
constitutional court saying that i

368
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,800
created a parallel state in romania

369
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
well i'm just i'm reading from one of

370
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,720
their rulings

371
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,839
of january 2019 now i know that

372
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
ultimately

373
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,399
charges against you were dropped but the

374
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,839
nonetheless it's a very serious

375
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,279
allegation that you created a parallel

376
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,600
justice system

377
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,279
the question really is do you believe

378
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,560
that in prosecuting

379
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,839
corruption and fraud that the ends

380
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,839
justify the means

381
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,519
if you read that decision based on

382
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,040
which the constitutional court revoked

383
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,680
me i should say

384
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,680
that i made a complaint to the european

385
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
court for human rights

386
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,440
and in this year in may the the

387
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
the judgment of the european court of

388
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,920
human rights said

389
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,199
that in that case my rights

390
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,880
were broken so i don't know

391
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:44,320
which kind of decision you you quoted

392
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,440
but i can say that in entire my activity

393
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,440
i respectfully i respect it all the time

394
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,279
the constitution i respected the

395
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
procedural criminal code

396
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
and all the nationals law but when it

397
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,079
comes to

398
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,560
saying i'm just asking you a simple

399
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,880
question now when it comes to rooting

400
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,680
out corruption do you believe as a

401
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,079
an aggressive prosecutor that the ends

402
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,360
do

403
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,240
justify the means now all the time in my

404
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,000
activity i respected the law and this is

405
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,480
the only principle that

406
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,160
i will have in the consideration and we

407
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,199
should have in the consideration

408
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,519
all the time to respect the law let me

409
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,399
ask you then now that you've gone from a

410
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,120
national role in romania to an eu

411
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,560
wide role rooting out corruption what

412
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
kind of cooperation do you think you're

413
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,399
going to get from a country like hungary

414
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
which already has made it plain it's

415
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,399
going to refuse to cooperate

416
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,240
and play a part in the european public

417
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,800
prosecutor offices

418
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
system they want no part of it alongside

419
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,440
some other nations including poland

420
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,199
sweden denmark island they basically

421
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,320
opted out and given that all of the

422
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,480
allegations

423
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
that we see about corruption and misuse

424
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
of eu money in hungary

425
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,920
how are you going to be able to operate

426
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,399
in hungary

427
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,800
we will operate based on the regulation

428
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,399
of the european public prosecutor office

429
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,560
and based on this regulation we can have

430
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,320
working arrangement with non-persistent

431
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,519
participating member state

432
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,360
including hungary and poland sweden

433
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,560
denmark and ireland and also with

434
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,199
third countries and we

435
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,320
started already to reach out to have

436
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,320
contacts with

437
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,560
hunger in poland we will continue with

438
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,839
the other non-participating member

439
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,199
states and we will have

440
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,360
working arrangement based on the uh

441
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,399
international cooperation instruments

442
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
that there are

443
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,880
available for prosecutors in their

444
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,560
activities let me ask you this what

445
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880
hungary and poland are countries that

446
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,160
receive huge amounts of

447
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,440
eu funds in structural and cohesion

448
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,279
funding terms why do you think as an

449
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,720
experienced prosecutor

450
00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:01,440
they might be keen to opt out of the

451
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,440
public prosecutor offices system

452
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,679
we will work with our colleagues based

453
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,160
on the legal instruments that we will

454
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,120
have

455
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,919
it is very difficult to say that we can

456
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,160
investigate

457
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
everything that it will happen in

458
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,319
hungary because they

459
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
in hungary and poland because they will

460
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,360
not

461
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,559
be part of the european public process

462
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,319
i'm asking you why

463
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,319
why miss kaveh why do you think that

464
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,480
they've opted out can you imagine

465
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,799
it is a political decision i cannot

466
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,440
comment i'm a prosecutor i can comment

467
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,799
only

468
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,840
based on my activity i cannot

469
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,799
answer why member state did not accept

470
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
to be part of

471
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,720
any dpo or not well let me ask you a

472
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,480
more specific question then i've just

473
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,559
been looking at some of the olaf

474
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,679
investigations in hungary what they

475
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
discovered and the

476
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,240
paperwork has been leaked so we know

477
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,000
it's uh it's directly from olaf

478
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,679
they discovered that there were for

479
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,160
example street lighting

480
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,799
contracts which were funded by the

481
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,200
european union which it seems

482
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,640
had been irregular in the way that

483
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,080
they'd been

484
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,400
tended for a company that was very

485
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,919
close to a close relative of the

486
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,960
hungarian prime minister

487
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,400
won these contracts uh olaf

488
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
as you've said in this interview

489
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,160
certainly wasn't capable of launching

490
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,640
criminal proceedings itself

491
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,440
in the future if that kind of thing

492
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,720
happens

493
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,080
in hungary will you be able to launch

494
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,039
criminal proceedings yes or no

495
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,679
we can launch proceedings only in those

496
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,120
cases

497
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,240
where uh together with uh let's say

498
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,640
take an example a hungarian person

499
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,480
is involved also a person from

500
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,000
participating member states

501
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,799
or if a part of activity is committing

502
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
on the territory on participating member

503
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,160
states

504
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,960
otherwise all the information that we

505
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,360
will have we have to send in hungary

506
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,039
see i'm just wondering what really has

507
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,160
changed from the very beginning of this

508
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,400
interview you've told me

509
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,559
you know this is a big new eu initiative

510
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,320
we've created a new office to really get

511
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
serious about anti-corruption and

512
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,679
anti-fraud but in the end

513
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,880
all of the cards are really still held

514
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,120
by the member states and your powers

515
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
only go so far as you get cooperation

516
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,000
from the member states and if you don't

517
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,440
get the cooperation you can't really

518
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,480
function

519
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,400
it's not exactly in this way we will

520
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,960
receive complaints directly here in

521
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,200
luxembourg at central level

522
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,960
we can have the possibility to

523
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
reallocate the investigation

524
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,080
from a member state to another member

525
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,600
state and

526
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,480
what is important is the quality and the

527
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,640
euro uh the professionalism of the

528
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,080
european delegated prosecutors

529
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,679
that will work for eppo the national

530
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,240
authorities has to

531
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
select those prosecutors and to propose

532
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,200
the european chief prosecutor to be

533
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,679
appointed

534
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,080
but it's important to say that they will

535
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,880
be independent in their activity

536
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,320
and they will make the investigations in

537
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,480
these cases

538
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,559
also it will be important because they

539
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
will not be limited by the national

540
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
borders

541
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,600
they can call for example a prosecutor

542
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,559
from romania can call

543
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,960
his colleagues from luxembourg to ask

544
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,240
for

545
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,440
information to find some documents to

546
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,120
find some proofs

547
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
and after that the colleague from

548
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,960
romania can use those proof directly

549
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,840
in the investigation without being

550
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,880
necessary to make any other formalities

551
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,320
so everything will be more efficient

552
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,679
more quick and uh in this way we will

553
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
protect better the

554
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,360
the european money the truth though if

555
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
you read

556
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,039
reports over many years from

557
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,120
transparency international from the

558
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,360
organized crime and corruption reporting

559
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,880
project and other ngos

560
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,919
is that eu monies have been siphoned off

561
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,720
and have entered the the hands of the

562
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,600
criminal

563
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,320
organized criminal elements including we

564
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
know

565
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,960
the mafia and other extremely powerful

566
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,960
organizations we also know that in

567
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
certain countries this involves

568
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,480
very powerful people close to political

569
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,360
power

570
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
so-called oligarchs as well do you

571
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,520
really believe

572
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,880
that you have both the power and the

573
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,080
political backing

574
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,400
to take these forces on

575
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,200
we will investigate of course all the

576
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,280
crimes related to the organized crime

577
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,760
and uh it's not necessary to have a

578
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,840
political backup because eppo will be

579
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,039
an independent prosecutor office the

580
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,080
prosecutor will be

581
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,559
independent so we need to do our work we

582
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,559
need to win the trust of the citizen

583
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,720
and we need to prove that the law is

584
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,320
equally for everybody and this will be

585
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,760
the role of eppo

586
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,720
to investigate also the powerful people

587
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:58,320
and to use all the the legal means that

588
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,400
we have to finalize our investigations

589
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,320
i'm tempted to ask you ms kaveh how

590
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,679
strong is your will on this matter i

591
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,440
know in romania

592
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,080
you took on powerful forces and you

593
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,520
faced personal threats you know what it

594
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,360
means to be

595
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,799
under a great deal of pressure but it

596
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,520
seems to me that pressure

597
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,480
as your job is now across europe that

598
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,880
pressure may get even more intense

599
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,440
well i'm used to work with pressure it's

600
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,280
not any problem for me and i'm sure that

601
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,520
it will not be a problem for the other

602
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,240
colleagues for eppo

603
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,640
there will be only good prosecutors here

604
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,080
very courageous very professional so

605
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,080
uh we will work together as a team and i

606
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
i'm sure that we will achieve what we

607
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,600
want so

608
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,720
it's not any problem if we will have

609
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,200
some

610
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,640
pressure are you really sure about that

611
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,280
you said in a recent interview

612
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
corruption

613
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,320
can be defeated do not abandon this

614
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
fight

615
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,440
experience across the eu would say that

616
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,960
rooting out

617
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,520
systemic corruption and which is cost

618
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,799
billions of euros to the european union

619
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,840
it's an impossible job

620
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,799
nobody's achieved it before it's not

621
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,760
impossible

622
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,559
we have to do our job and we have to

623
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,080
fight but

624
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,120
to eradicate corruption it's important

625
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,960
not to to to rely all the time only on

626
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,840
the work of prosecutors

627
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,080
it is the same with the financial

628
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,799
criminality

629
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,039
we have to work together in a team with

630
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,159
the other european institution

631
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,799
with the national authorities with the

632
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,000
entire society because in the end

633
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,039
each citizen can be a part

634
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,600
in this fight and can help the

635
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,440
the prosecutors to to fight with this

636
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,840
criminality

637
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,840
