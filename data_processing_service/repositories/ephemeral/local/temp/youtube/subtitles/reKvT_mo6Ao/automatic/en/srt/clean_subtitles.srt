welcome to hardtalk i'm stephen sacca the eu is thought to have lost more than 10 billion euros to fraud over the last two decades and yet it's anti-fraud and corruption agencies have long lacked the teeth to root out the problem could that be about to change well my guest is romanian lara kovaci the eu's first public prosecutor she has enhanced powers to tackle transnational crime but if member states refuse to play ball how can she succeed [Music] lara kovichi in luxembourg welcome to hard talk thank you very much for the invitation you have had almost a year since your appointment as the eu's first chief public prosecutor you are trying to deal with a very urgent problem that costs the eu billions of euros what have you actually done so far i took my office in 1st of november and i started to organize together with the small team that i found here to in the beginning the administrative issues that are necessary to start eppo is necessary to have the european prosecutors it's those prosecutors who will work here with me in luxembourg and also we need to have the european delegated prosecutors the european delegated prosecutor is those prosecutors who will work in their national member states would you agree would you agree would you agree with me that the problem is indeed very urgent we are talking about the role of organized crime in siphoning off billions of euros from the agricultural funds the cohesion funds right across the european union some countries are particularly bad and yet you're telling me after nine months you really haven't begun work yet you're just working out your administration yes it is necessary to have a bpo but in order to to start working in the cases we need to build the new office this means that we we need to have all the internal regulation we need to have all the prosecutors on board and it's not a decision that only one person can take it's a shared responsibility between the european commission european parliament the council and the national uh authorities of each member state participating to the european public prosecutor office yeah did it worry you when you realized that some of the team you were supposed to lead were going to be part-time and that your total staffing appears to number some 40 to 50 in your central office and then a bunch of local prosecutors in member countries who at least according to the commission were going to be working part-time well we speak here about the possibility for prosecutors to work full-time and part-time my wish is to have only full-time prosecutors this is very important for their independence for their efficiency for the responsibility i cannot imagine how a european delegate prosecutor can work for our story ppo and during the the pleading in the trial he has to uh to go and to continue his activity to and to work for the national prosecutor office this is the reason why in my consultation with the member states i insisted to have only full-time prosecutors right the fact that they were talking about part-timers it may be it's symptomatic of a problem at the heart of the eu which is they've never really taken rooting out systematic corruption seriously we can see that over many years if we look at the scale of the problem and the response from the eu and their in particular their european anti-fraud office olaf we see that time and again uh investigations have been begun but they've not led to prosecutions it's a fundamental problem isn't it it is the european public prosecutor will be the first uh prosecutor office at the european level what we will achieve with that we will have a unitary approach related to this phenomena and in the same time we will solve this issue related to the discrepancies between the member states of course in this period i evaluated the statistics and i saw there are some member states on which we have hundreds of cases in each year but also we have some member states where only two or nine investigations per per year was uh made by the prosecutors yeah we will solve this issue to be blunt about it miss kaveshi it's clear that some member states are absolutely not serious about using the information that's been dug up by the eu's anti-corruption investigators again if one looks at the current situation with this olaf anti-fraud office at the eu they launched 541 cases which they said should go to court in fact only 308 of them did 171 of those were dismissed and there were only 137 indictments in other words many member states are simply not interested in taking seriously this problem yes having eppo we will solve this issue because we will have the same priorities but it's important to to make a small comment related to a love and to explain that until now olaf did only administrative investigations they did not make criminal investigation only the prosecutor can do that so eppo will be the only body at the european level who can make investigation we will have prosecutors we are all participating member states and this is very important when we speak about this phenomena especially related to financial fraud sometimes the prosecutor the law informers enforcement are not focused on this type of criminality in the same way in an equal way in all the member states eppo will change that so having a highest number of investigation in some member states or less in another member states doesn't mean that we don't have problems you we we cannot speak about usual suspects when we speak about the financial fraud there are problems in all the member states and having tppo at the national level in each participating member states we it will be very good because we can increase the level of protection of the european funds and of course we will investigate better all right efficiently this kind of crimes well i think it's worth reminding people when you talk about the eppo you mean the european public prosecutors office exactly so that's what you're leading i think it's fair to say you got the job because of your pretty remarkable track record in romania during your time leading the anti-corruption director in your home country romania i see that you led the campaign against a whole bunch of senior politicians the former prime minister mr nastasi was convicted of corruption offences during your term former or current ministers 43 parliamentarians 260 local officials all were subject to investigation during your time in romania are you going to go for the big beasts across europe now in your new job of course we will investigate financial fraud we will investigate powerful people but what is important to say is what i did in romania and what i will do here in eppo i will not to be alone i will have the entire team with me and this is very important we will be prosecutors of 22 different member states and we will put together our experience our knowledge and we will investigate better this uh phenomena but the problem together with them i wanted to do a good job well we'll get we'll get to the 22 states and why it's not uh more in a moment but just to focus on romania and whether you really made a difference you you were a controversial figure you certainly uh took on some of the most powerful people in your country but if one looks at the state of romania when you left the job and you were fired by the government eventually uh when you left transparency international thought that romania was actually performing worse it ranked 70th in the world in terms of corruption index in 2019 it was going backwards it was the second most corrupt country in europe uh just uh outdone by bulgaria it doesn't seem to be honest that despite your best efforts you made much difference well when we speak about to eradicate corruption or to reduce the level of corruption in one country i think it's not the only responsibility of prosecutors to to fight with this phenomena it is necessary to have an entire effort also the prosecutors also to prevent corruption also to to have good laws and to offer the enough to offer enough instruments to the prosecutors to investigate those crimes it is important to say that also the mentality and the entire society can contribute to to decrease the level of corruption in a country so not only arresting or investigating people we can solve the issue of corruption in one member state but what is important now is that we will have the european public prosecutor office of the european level and we will use uh all the legal instruments that we have and we will work better because we will have also here in luxembourg at the central level financial investigation investigators case analysts and together we can analyze you we can aggregate and put together all the dots when we speak about the course the crimes when we speak about corruption and especially when we speak about financial uh criminal let me stop you a minute because people across europe are going to be interested in how you're going to do the job and it is indeed notable that you had a certain reputation in romania for uh let's say pushing the envelope in terms of investigative practice you it seems we're prepared to use the intelligence services in a covert fashion to dig dirt on some of the suspects that you were going after and in the uh romanian constitutional court some of your methods were called into question do you regret some of the methods you used no it's not about the methods it's about the working arrangement that we had but at that moment based on the legislation we receive information from the secret services and we use those information to open the cases but it's important to say and to clarify that our investigations were made by the prosecutors and by the police officers and no one from the uh officials from the service secret service did not work in our cases only the prosecutors to be honest with you police officers i i'll be honest with you i i was very struck by a former uh romanian prime minister mr tariqanu saying that under your watch the anti-corruption agency had not respected legal frameworks had become corrupt themselves and had become a part of the political fight in romania some critics called you a part of securitate 2.0 because of your cooperation with the security services again i put it to you that if you bring those methods to your europe-wide prosecutor role you're going to make many people very unhappy all our cases that we worked in romania were checked and verified in the court so at the european level we will work according to the legislation as i did it in romania all the time and everything that the prosecutors did in the cases were checked in the court by judges but with respect to the constitutional the constitutional court in january uh 2019 concluded that you had created a parallel justice system existing outside the rules imposed by romania's constitution there is no any decision of constitutional court saying that i created a parallel state in romania well i'm just i'm reading from one of their rulings of january 2019 now i know that ultimately charges against you were dropped but the nonetheless it's a very serious allegation that you created a parallel justice system the question really is do you believe that in prosecuting corruption and fraud that the ends justify the means if you read that decision based on which the constitutional court revoked me i should say that i made a complaint to the european court for human rights and in this year in may the the the judgment of the european court of human rights said that in that case my rights were broken so i don't know which kind of decision you you quoted but i can say that in entire my activity i respectfully i respect it all the time the constitution i respected the procedural criminal code and all the nationals law but when it comes to saying i'm just asking you a simple question now when it comes to rooting out corruption do you believe as a an aggressive prosecutor that the ends do justify the means now all the time in my activity i respected the law and this is the only principle that i will have in the consideration and we should have in the consideration all the time to respect the law let me ask you then now that you've gone from a national role in romania to an eu wide role rooting out corruption what kind of cooperation do you think you're going to get from a country like hungary which already has made it plain it's going to refuse to cooperate and play a part in the european public prosecutor offices system they want no part of it alongside some other nations including poland sweden denmark island they basically opted out and given that all of the allegations that we see about corruption and misuse of eu money in hungary how are you going to be able to operate in hungary we will operate based on the regulation of the european public prosecutor office and based on this regulation we can have working arrangement with non-persistent participating member state including hungary and poland sweden denmark and ireland and also with third countries and we started already to reach out to have contacts with hunger in poland we will continue with the other non-participating member states and we will have working arrangement based on the uh international cooperation instruments that there are available for prosecutors in their activities let me ask you this what hungary and poland are countries that receive huge amounts of eu funds in structural and cohesion funding terms why do you think as an experienced prosecutor they might be keen to opt out of the public prosecutor offices system we will work with our colleagues based on the legal instruments that we will have it is very difficult to say that we can investigate everything that it will happen in hungary because they in hungary and poland because they will not be part of the european public process i'm asking you why why miss kaveh why do you think that they've opted out can you imagine it is a political decision i cannot comment i'm a prosecutor i can comment only based on my activity i cannot answer why member state did not accept to be part of any dpo or not well let me ask you a more specific question then i've just been looking at some of the olaf investigations in hungary what they discovered and the paperwork has been leaked so we know it's uh it's directly from olaf they discovered that there were for example street lighting contracts which were funded by the european union which it seems had been irregular in the way that they'd been tended for a company that was very close to a close relative of the hungarian prime minister won these contracts uh olaf as you've said in this interview certainly wasn't capable of launching criminal proceedings itself in the future if that kind of thing happens in hungary will you be able to launch criminal proceedings yes or no we can launch proceedings only in those cases where uh together with uh let's say take an example a hungarian person is involved also a person from participating member states or if a part of activity is committing on the territory on participating member states otherwise all the information that we will have we have to send in hungary see i'm just wondering what really has changed from the very beginning of this interview you've told me you know this is a big new eu initiative we've created a new office to really get serious about anti-corruption and anti-fraud but in the end all of the cards are really still held by the member states and your powers only go so far as you get cooperation from the member states and if you don't get the cooperation you can't really function it's not exactly in this way we will receive complaints directly here in luxembourg at central level we can have the possibility to reallocate the investigation from a member state to another member state and what is important is the quality and the euro uh the professionalism of the european delegated prosecutors that will work for eppo the national authorities has to select those prosecutors and to propose the european chief prosecutor to be appointed but it's important to say that they will be independent in their activity and they will make the investigations in these cases also it will be important because they will not be limited by the national borders they can call for example a prosecutor from romania can call his colleagues from luxembourg to ask for information to find some documents to find some proofs and after that the colleague from romania can use those proof directly in the investigation without being necessary to make any other formalities so everything will be more efficient more quick and uh in this way we will protect better the the european money the truth though if you read reports over many years from transparency international from the organized crime and corruption reporting project and other ngos is that eu monies have been siphoned off and have entered the the hands of the criminal organized criminal elements including we know the mafia and other extremely powerful organizations we also know that in certain countries this involves very powerful people close to political power so-called oligarchs as well do you really believe that you have both the power and the political backing to take these forces on we will investigate of course all the crimes related to the organized crime and uh it's not necessary to have a political backup because eppo will be an independent prosecutor office the prosecutor will be independent so we need to do our work we need to win the trust of the citizen and we need to prove that the law is equally for everybody and this will be the role of eppo to investigate also the powerful people and to use all the the legal means that we have to finalize our investigations i'm tempted to ask you ms kaveh how strong is your will on this matter i know in romania you took on powerful forces and you faced personal threats you know what it means to be under a great deal of pressure but it seems to me that pressure as your job is now across europe that pressure may get even more intense well i'm used to work with pressure it's not any problem for me and i'm sure that it will not be a problem for the other colleagues for eppo there will be only good prosecutors here very courageous very professional so uh we will work together as a team and i i'm sure that we will achieve what we want so it's not any problem if we will have some pressure are you really sure about that you said in a recent interview corruption can be defeated do not abandon this fight experience across the eu would say that rooting out systemic corruption and which is cost billions of euros to the european union it's an impossible job nobody's achieved it before it's not impossible we have to do our job and we have to fight but to eradicate corruption it's important not to to to rely all the time only on the work of prosecutors it is the same with the financial criminality we have to work together in a team with the other european institution with the national authorities with the entire society because in the end each citizen can be a part in this fight and can help the the prosecutors to to fight with this criminality lara kovichi i thank you very much indeed for joining me from luxembourg thank you [Music] you
