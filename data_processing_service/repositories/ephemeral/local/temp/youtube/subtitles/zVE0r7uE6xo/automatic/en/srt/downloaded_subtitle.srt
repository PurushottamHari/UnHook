00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,759

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,199
If we look at the history of wars of the last 100 years, world wars have occurred whenever big countries have

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,160
fought among themselves.  But these are

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,199
not the only wars that have taken place.  Many small

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,720
countries and many small groups have

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,800
challenged big powers.  Like Vietnam challenged the

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
United States of America, the

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Mujahideen challenged the USSR

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,719
in Afghanistan, the Taliban challenged the United States of America

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,079
and today we are seeing how Ukraine is

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,079
challenging Russia.

14
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,280
The tactics these apps deploy.

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,200
These tactics are unconventional.  Like

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,600
guerilla tactics like use of small

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,120
weapons.  In the same line, today drone attack has

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,039
emerged as a new method of unconventional warfare.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,840
On June 1, 2025, Ukraine

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,560
did something that the world had never

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,479
seen before.  Drone attacks have been happening

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
since the last three-four years.

23
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,000
But what Ukraine did this time was

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,720
completely different.  And in this Ukraine

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,479
smuggled all the goods into Russia.

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,680
It was sent there as construction material.

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,840
It was assembled there and through those drones,

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,520
five air fields of Russia were

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,759
attacked.  He operated these drones remotely

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,479

31
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,119
using the help of artificial intelligence.  So the question arises whether

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,960
drones are the future of warfare?  It

33
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,720
seems like such a romantic idea that

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,200
if a country has the preparedness of drones,

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,439
it will excel in any kind of warfare.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,439
Now you must have seen

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
Operation Sindoor between India and Pakistan,

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,759
which was carried out by India

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,000
after the Pahalgam attack on Pakistan. After this, a

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,600
discussion started that drone is the future of

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,640
warfare.  Today it is very important for

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,520
any country to know how

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,399
powerful a tool a drone is.  How

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,119
can drones handle warfare and is this the future of

45
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,680
warfare?  Drones have a

46
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,360
dominant role in modern warfare.  So why are these small

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
countries so dependent on drones

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,760
?  Why is it repeatedly using drones against

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,319
big countries?

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,879
One of the biggest reasons for this is that drones are cheap and

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,400
cost effective.  It does

52
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,319
nâ€™t take much technology to make them.  There is

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,599

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,000
no need for very skilled people.  And that's why it's like

55
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,400
Ukraine just attacked Russia.  This

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,840
attack was being operated from a small village.

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,319
Secondly, because of this, smaller countries can cause huge

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,400
losses to bigger countries.  It

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,480

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
cost Ukraine only one million dollars to complete this project.

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
But the losses that Russia

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,920
suffered on their airfields were worth

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,800
approximately $ billions of dollars.  But

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,840
here a question arises: are such

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,200
operations equivalent to winning a full-scale war

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,840
?  If we look at history, many such

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,080
small spectacular attacks have been carried out by many small

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,159
countries.  The biggest example is the

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680

70
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,360
attack by Japan on Pearl Harbor in the United States of

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,200
America during World War II.  Similarly, Vietnam

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
continued to challenge the US throughout the Cold War.  In

73
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,400
this way many Mujahideen continued to

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,879
challenge against USR.  But was

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,120
this equivalent to winning the war?  Today, if

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,280
we look at the dominance of any country in the world,

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,040
then the dominance is of those countries that have

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,200
not depended on just one technology or have

80
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,599
not shown confidence in any one technology.  The countries that are

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,280
powerful and dominant have

82
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,519
created a big strategy and the biggest

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
example of this is the United States of America.

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,840
Although it was challenged by many terrace organizations

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,159
in Afghanistan.  Even though he had to

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
face many challenges in Vietnam.

87
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,400
Although it had to face attack from Japan

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,400
at Pearl Harbor.  But he created a full-

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,159
fledged military strategy and

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,959
because of that today the United States of America is

91
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,799
a military superpower of the world.   It is

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
not that big countries are

93
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,799
not using drone warfare or drones are

94
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,720
not important for them.  Drones

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,360
are a necessity for them but not an ultimate weapon of

96
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,680
warfare.  It is only one part of

97
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,400
their whole military arsenal.  Their dominance

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,799
is because of three parts of the

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,600
warfare.  One Air Force, Military and their

100
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,239
Navy.  All three together make him powerful.

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
Smaller countries are more dependent on drones

102
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,000
which they find to be

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,880
cost effective.  This will cause more damage.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,440
Within that they have to face many limitations.

105
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,600
Like when the Ukraine Russia war

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,320
started, Ukraine started drone attacks

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,560
but Russia immediately

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
found a way to stop them.  Drone attacks

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,720
depend on electronic warfare.

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,720
And as soon as any country intercepts their signals,

111
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,479
it disables them electronically.  There is

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,320

113
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,560
no need to kill them one by one again and again.  Secondly, the

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,720
attack that Ukraine has just carried out

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
on Russia was done after a lot of planning.

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
A lot of planning is required to carry out this type of attack.

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
So do you have that many

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,440
resources?  Do you have that much time

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,240
?  Like Ukraine

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,960
took about two to two and a half years to conduct this attack.

121
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
But once this attack happened, Russia

122
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
retaliated in such a way that

123
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
they had already used drones.

124
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
Along with this they used missiles and

125
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,680
glide bombs.  Because of that

126
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,360

127
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,080
they destroyed many buildings in major cities like Kharkiv.

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,440

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,960
How will a small country like Ukraine recover from this damage?  One thing is also being

130
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,759
said that drones are exactly like Tesla's

131
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,680
driverless car.  Like Tesla

132
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
's driverless car Aldo is a very

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,039
beautiful technology.  It is an emerging

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,440
technology.  But still

135
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,440
she fails in many cases.  Because

136
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,600
Tesla's car

137
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
needs a predictable environment to operate.  Without a

138
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,240
predictable environment he might

139
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,120
understand an instruction wrongly.  He may

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,440
not be able to read the situation properly and may fail.

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Similarly, the

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
problem with drones is that they

143
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,639
can work in a predictable environment but it is

144
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,880

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,840

146
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,400
not easy to use them effectively in a hyperdynamic war environment.  Drones can be used in conjunction with

147
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,280
already existing conventional

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,520
military tactics.  If we take the example of

149
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,919
India and Pakistan and Operation Sindoor.

150
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,240
Pakistan launched a drone attack on India.

151
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,720
But India started

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,680
as a powerful country.  India

153
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,479
attacked nine of their military training camps.

154
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,280
Very precise by using our Rafale jets

155
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,520
and using our missiles.

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,840
When Pakistan attacked India with drones with the

157
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,360
help of Turkey,

158
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,759
India countered them effectively.

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Whereas India is not even a very drone

160
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,199
proficient country.  And

161
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,199
India's anti-drone systems are not that strong

162
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,199
yet.  Even then India countered them.

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,960
And when India counter-

164
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
attacked using its BrahMos missile and

165
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,600
its aircraft, the

166
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,639
damage and humiliation that Pakistan suffered was something that

167
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,199
Pakistan has never suffered before.

168
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,800
One thing is clear from this, drone is no doubt

169
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,960
a very promising technology

170
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,440
for the future of warfare.  But can

171
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,440
wars be won by relying on drones alone?

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,360
Do you think Ukraine will be

173
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,199
able to win the war against Russia relying only on drones?  Do

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
you think Pakistan, which

175
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,880
borrowed drones from Turkey, attacked us?

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,039
Could he have won against India relying on these only

177
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,120
?  India is

178
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,520
able to counter them effectively because it has

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
a very prominent missile

180
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,560
technology.  India's Akash missile

181
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,360
completely disabled Pakistan's drones.

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,680
Pakistan was not able to launch even a single successful attack on

183
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,680
India's installations.

184
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,000
So the thing is that today the

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,880
countries which have shown interest in modern warfare after Operation Sindoor,

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,039

187
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,360
many

188
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,840
countries have expressed their desire to purchase India's missile technology.

189
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
Like there was a drone warfare inside Armenia and Azerbaijan too.

190
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,319
Azran carried out

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,039
major drone attacks over Armenia.

192
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,360
But Armenia has talked about purchasing Akash missiles from India.  At the

193
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
same time, there is

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,319

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,479

196
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,520
a race to purchase India's Brahmos which had shown superiority in missiles in this Operation Sindoor.

197
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,400
And Philippines is the recent purchaser of

198
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,639
BrahMos missile.  So, if

199
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,479
you want to be dominant in warfare.  If

200
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,120
you want to emerge as a powerful military country.

201
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,280
If you want to avoid the threat from small countries then

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,199
no doubt you will have to invest in drones.

203
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,280
But the most

204
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,720
important thing is that you make your three forces

205
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,280
very powerful.  Like the Army, your

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,360
Air Force, and your Navy.  Jai Hind.
