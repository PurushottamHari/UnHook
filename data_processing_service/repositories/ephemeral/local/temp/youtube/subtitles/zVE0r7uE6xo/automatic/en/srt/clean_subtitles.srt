But these are not the only wars that have taken place.  Many small countries and many small groups have challenged big powers.  Like Vietnam challenged the United States of America, the Mujahideen challenged the USSR in Afghanistan, the Taliban challenged the United States of America and today we are seeing how Ukraine is challenging Russia. The tactics these apps deploy. These tactics are unconventional.  Like guerilla tactics like use of small weapons.  In the same line, today drone attack has emerged as a new method of unconventional warfare. On June 1, 2025, Ukraine did something that the world had never seen before.  Drone attacks have been happening since the last three-four years. But what Ukraine did this time was completely different.  And in this Ukraine smuggled all the goods into Russia. It was sent there as construction material. It was assembled there and through those drones, five air fields of Russia were attacked.  He operated these drones remotely using the help of artificial intelligence.  So the question arises whether drones are the future of warfare?  It seems like such a romantic idea that if a country has the preparedness of drones, it will excel in any kind of warfare. Now you must have seen Operation Sindoor between India and Pakistan, which was carried out by India after the Pahalgam attack on Pakistan. After this, a discussion started that drone is the future of warfare.  Today it is very important for any country to know how powerful a tool a drone is.  How can drones handle warfare and is this the future of warfare?  Drones have a dominant role in modern warfare.  So why are these small countries so dependent on drones ?  Why is it repeatedly using drones against big countries? One of the biggest reasons for this is that drones are cheap and cost effective.  It does nâ€™t take much technology to make them.  There is no need for very skilled people.  And that's why it's like Ukraine just attacked Russia.  This attack was being operated from a small village. Secondly, because of this, smaller countries can cause huge losses to bigger countries.  It cost Ukraine only one million dollars to complete this project. But the losses that Russia suffered on their airfields were worth approximately $ billions of dollars.  But here a question arises: are such operations equivalent to winning a full-scale war ?  If we look at history, many such small spectacular attacks have been carried out by many small countries.  The biggest example is the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbor in the United States of America during World War II.  Similarly, Vietnam continued to challenge the US throughout the Cold War.  In this way many Mujahideen continued to challenge against USR.  But was this equivalent to winning the war?  Today, if we look at the dominance of any country in the world, then the dominance is of those countries that have not depended on just one technology or have not shown confidence in any one technology.  The countries that are powerful and dominant have created a big strategy and the biggest example of this is the United States of America. Although it was challenged by many terrace organizations in Afghanistan.  Even though he had to face many challenges in Vietnam. Although it had to face attack from Japan at Pearl Harbor.  But he created a full- fledged military strategy and because of that today the United States of America is a military superpower of the world.   It is not that big countries are not using drone warfare or drones are not important for them.  Drones are a necessity for them but not an ultimate weapon of warfare.  It is only one part of their whole military arsenal.  Their dominance is because of three parts of the warfare.  One Air Force, Military and their Navy.  All three together make him powerful. Smaller countries are more dependent on drones which they find to be cost effective.  This will cause more damage. Within that they have to face many limitations. Like when the Ukraine Russia war started, Ukraine started drone attacks but Russia immediately found a way to stop them.  Drone attacks depend on electronic warfare. And as soon as any country intercepts their signals, it disables them electronically.  There is no need to kill them one by one again and again.  Secondly, the attack that Ukraine has just carried out on Russia was done after a lot of planning. A lot of planning is required to carry out this type of attack. So do you have that many resources?  Do you have that much time ?  Like Ukraine took about two to two and a half years to conduct this attack. But once this attack happened, Russia retaliated in such a way that they had already used drones. Along with this they used missiles and glide bombs.  Because of that they destroyed many buildings in major cities like Kharkiv. How will a small country like Ukraine recover from this damage?  One thing is also being said that drones are exactly like Tesla's driverless car.  Like Tesla 's driverless car Aldo is a very beautiful technology.  It is an emerging technology.  But still she fails in many cases.  Because Tesla's car needs a predictable environment to operate.  Without a predictable environment he might understand an instruction wrongly.  He may not be able to read the situation properly and may fail. Similarly, the problem with drones is that they can work in a predictable environment but it is not easy to use them effectively in a hyperdynamic war environment.  Drones can be used in conjunction with already existing conventional military tactics.  If we take the example of India and Pakistan and Operation Sindoor. Pakistan launched a drone attack on India. But India started as a powerful country.  India attacked nine of their military training camps. Very precise by using our Rafale jets and using our missiles. When Pakistan attacked India with drones with the help of Turkey, India countered them effectively. Whereas India is not even a very drone proficient country.  And India's anti-drone systems are not that strong yet.  Even then India countered them. And when India counter- attacked using its BrahMos missile and its aircraft, the damage and humiliation that Pakistan suffered was something that Pakistan has never suffered before. One thing is clear from this, drone is no doubt a very promising technology for the future of warfare.  But can wars be won by relying on drones alone? Do you think Ukraine will be able to win the war against Russia relying only on drones?  Do you think Pakistan, which borrowed drones from Turkey, attacked us? Could he have won against India relying on these only ?  India is able to counter them effectively because it has a very prominent missile technology.  India's Akash missile completely disabled Pakistan's drones. Pakistan was not able to launch even a single successful attack on India's installations. So the thing is that today the countries which have shown interest in modern warfare after Operation Sindoor, many countries have expressed their desire to purchase India's missile technology. Like there was a drone warfare inside Armenia and Azerbaijan too. Azran carried out major drone attacks over Armenia. But Armenia has talked about purchasing Akash missiles from India.  At the same time, there is a race to purchase India's Brahmos which had shown superiority in missiles in this Operation Sindoor. And Philippines is the recent purchaser of BrahMos missile.  So, if you want to be dominant in warfare.  If you want to emerge as a powerful military country. If you want to avoid the threat from small countries then no doubt you will have to invest in drones. But the most important thing is that you make your three forces very powerful.  Like the Army, your Air Force, and your Navy.  Jai Hind. Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.
