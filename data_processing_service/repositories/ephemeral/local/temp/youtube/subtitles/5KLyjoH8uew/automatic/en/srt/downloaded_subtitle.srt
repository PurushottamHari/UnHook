1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,679
Immediately Osama handed over his wife to the Navy SEALs.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,679
threw it in the face and navy seal

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,120
When he plugged in that hard drive and checked it

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,120
So it was revealed that Osama used to watch adult content

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,600
Is. Osama's children under the pretext of vaccine

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,300
There was a plan to take DNA and as soon as I reached the gate

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,240
I reached there and rang the bell.

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,320
[music]

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,320
Osama left Torabora with horses and

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,360
On mules towards the Pakistan border

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,600
It entered. My Country More. I decided the

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,480
Codes on mountains due to reflection in mirror

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,399
Creating Osama from one mountain to another

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,200
Started sending messages. Exterior of the Compound

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,960
Infrared cameras were brought and Osama's body heat was detected

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,280
Extracted thermal images from.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
Osama's DNA was shared between both helicopters

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,600
and under Pakistan's radar

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,920
They began to fly and secretly surrounded the compound

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,280
There were listening devices in the trees on the side

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,600
I had hidden it.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,190
Do anything but Pakistan won't know

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,479

25
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,840
Needed Look at short content consumption nowadays

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,799
But everyone is very concerned. Dum

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Scrolling, brain rattling, attention span,

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,320
Deficiency, all these terms are very common nowadays

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,799
It's done. Content consumption or mobile driving

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,439
People just consider it a waste of time. But

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
Is it bad to watch anything on mobile? So

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,159
Look, it depends on what you

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,400
You are consuming it. You can use the same mobile

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
For some useful constructive consumption

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,280
You can use it also. There are many such examples

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,200
In the world, those who have learned things online

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,079
I have grown myself. a lot like that

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,799
Sikho App is a good platform. 5 crore people

You can. I gave the link in the description

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
Gave. So let's come back to the topic. See 11

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,000
In September 2001, when the world's dominance was over the US,

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,239
The biggest attack was happening at the same time

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
It was Osama who carried out this attack.

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
One in the eastern side of Afghanistan

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
It is a mountainous area and it is inside the US

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,519
As soon as this attack took place,

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,560
de were US intelligence agencies that included the CIA,

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,640
The FBI and NSA did this without wasting any time

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
The investigation of this entire attack is underway

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,879
Would go. The first thing I did was to board the flight

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
All the passengers who were onboard

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,280
The records of passports and visas

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
I took them out and started checking them and

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,440
By doing this he took care of even the smallest details

67
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
found out and then 19 of them

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
They identified those who felt that

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
These could be the hijackers. Now this is the attack

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
It had been done. Whatever plane was inside,

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,159
There were people, all the stuff, every thing was destroyed

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
It had already happened. and US Intelligence Agencies

73
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,040
had to find out every single detail about these 19

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,239
The hijackers whose names were revealed were among

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,280
from which the hijacker was named Mohammed Atta

76
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,680
The bag was accidentally dropped, it was a coincidence. his bag

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,760
Mistakenly causing delay in connecting flight

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,840
was left at Boston Logan Airport

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,640
Was. Now without wasting any time

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
The CIA team located this bag and put it there

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,400
reaches over and opens it and luckily

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
They don't need to work hard

83
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,120
it happens because what is inside this bag

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,200
He was looking for all the details.

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,360
I had found the same place. Al Qaeda is inside this bag

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
The instructions of the training,

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
Planning, manuals, everything was there. Even

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
that the will of Mohammed Atta who was

89
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Even that which was there was found inside it. And these

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,959
All the details confirmed that behind this

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
Al Qaeda's Osama also has a hand in this. and its

92
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,200
Even after this these people do not stop. This is the 19

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,680
They were hijackers ever since they came to the US

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
His old calls, emails, bank details

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
Start tracking these transactions as well

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,040
did. And in searching all these things they

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,720
Got official confirmation that all this

98
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,720
This is an attack, it was not carried out by Al Qaeda. Because

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
The funding that these hijackers were receiving

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,040
She came from Al Qaeda inside the US. Who

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
He made a wire transfer from his Dubai account.

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,000
I had done. And all these hijackers were

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,599
He has served in Afghanistan and Pakistan

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
I trained in the area, now from here it

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,360
There was an official confirmation that

106
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,359
It's the work of Al Qaeda. But this Al Qaeda

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,079
The name was not new to the US. The CIA

108
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,320
In August 2001 itself, the team of

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,639
A warning was given a month before that

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,720
Al Qaeda is going to do something like this. In the Past

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,400
Al Qaeda has also attacked US embassy etc.

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,320
attacked many times

113
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,720
Are. And the US is from Afghanistan

114
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,360
He would have made the demand for Al Qaeda and Osama earlier too

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,840
remained. And the US already has Al Qaeda's

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,520
There was a network, Osama's details were already there

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,600
They have it. pretty much all over the US

118
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,479
This thing was angry. now when all these things

119
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,360
If it is found out then after that on 20 September 2001

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,759
to President George W. Bush in a joint

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,440
Go to the session of Congress and give speech

122
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
in which he is in front of the whole world

123
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
They say to Afghanistan that without any

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,000
First of all, give us Osama as a condition and secondly

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
Inside Afghanistan, these are the al-Qaeda's

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Training camps are going on, stop it immediately

127
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
will have to do and if it is not done then the US

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
The military will take action. Now your question

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,800
It will be certain that Afghanistan will hand over Osama.

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Why would he mess with such a big super power?

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
Will you take it? But inside Afghanistan,

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,840
The situation that was going on was also not normal.

133
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,320
Civil war has been going on in Afghanistan since 1992

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,160
Was. In which it was said that 90% of Afghanistan

135
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
The area was under Taliban control

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,479
And the Northern Alliance occupies 10% of the area

137
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,479
Was. And the Taliban are already fighting battles

138
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,560
Osama was inside Afghanistan

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,479
had helped the Taliban a lot. From funding

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
to train Taliban fighters

141
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,280
till. Osama helped the Taliban a lot

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,520
And ideologically also Taliban and Al Qaeda

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Were aligned. So just like that Osama was picked up

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,120
It is not easy for the Taliban to give to the US

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,680
Was. Taliban's own situation may also worsen

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,240
let's go. So as soon as the US made this demand

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
The Taliban attacked the next day, i.e. on 21 September

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,440
I told him in 2001 that whatever you are saying

149
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
Give me proof that this attack was carried out by Osama

150
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
Got it done. then we think about it

151
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,880
In. And along with this the Taliban also

152
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
He said that Osama is our guest.

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,560
So we will pick up our guest just like this

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Can't give it. This is against our civilization

155
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,039
Is. Look, the US was anything at that time.

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,880
was not ready to listen and the Taliban

157
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,360
As soon as he refused to give it to Osama

158
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,759
Just two weeks later, the USA

159
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,600
Preparation Key and Operation Enduring Freedom

160
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,840
started in Afghanistan

161
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,960
In which USA did what in Afghanistan

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,280
The Northern Alliance was the enemy of the Taliban

163
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,160
Together with all the hideouts of the Taliban

164
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,240
Destroying them inside Afghanistan

165
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
Started and started searching for Osama

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,560
Did. The biggest leaders who were of the Taliban

167
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
started killing them one by one and

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
The Northern Alliance inside Afghanistan

169
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
Force which was helping USA with this

170
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160
USA got a lot of advantage due to location etc.

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
To find out and kill them. Now

172
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,560
USA was killing Taliban day by day

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,479
was being defeated and inside Afghanistan

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,400
Doing big operations one after the other

175
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,639
Was. Now from here the situation of Osama was

176
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
It also started getting worse. Hiding for Osama too

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
It was getting difficult. so what did osama do

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,440
Did? Osama took his bodyguard with him

179
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,919
in Afghanistan this here this Torabora

180
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,599
There are hills of. He has come here.

181
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,360
Pakistan border is also near it

182
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,520
Seems like This hilly area right here

183
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,599
Is. So Osama came and sat here. Now

184
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,680
After reaching here Osama and his men

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,759
All the fighters had electronic

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,759
Use this method to a minimum

187
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,000
Gave. Just sometimes when there was a need

188
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,919
Through an unsecured radio transmission

189
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,919
These people used to communicate. and because

190
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
Electronic method was not used. So

191
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,000
Whatever advanced technology the US had

192
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,880
All his methods were failing. Now

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,520
After this he searches for US for several days and

194
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,759
There are three or four such things in front of the US

195
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,160
Because of which, they come to know that

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
Osama is in Tora Bora. first thing

197
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
So what happened was that the US had

198
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,639
Al-Qaeda members were caught inside them

199
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,880
One of them told me that he had seen the last Joe

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,960
I saw him looking towards the hills of Torabora

201
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,120
I saw him while leaving. Now on the basis of this one clue

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,880
USA should not go to Tora Bora and attack

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
Could have done. Torabora was a very large area and

204
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,319
It was a hilly area. now the second thing after this

205
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,479
It happened that a US agency

206
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,639
There was a specific team which was working for Al Qaeda

207
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,319
unsecured radio signals which were

208
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,479
through which people communicate with each other

209
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,400
She used to sit and listen to him. so that communication

210
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,319
He also mentioned the name of Toraboda in

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,479
heard and along with it there was a team from USA

212
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,919
which is based on Al Qaeda's method of communication

213
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,080
I was studying. He had told that

214
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,840
Al-Qaeda members are fighting among themselves in the hills

215
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,560
I used to communicate so what is this in that

216
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,400
used to do that from the reflection of the mirror into the code

217
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
We used to talk to each other inside the hill.

218
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,560
So in the hills of Torabora also this

219
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,520
He saw the reflections daily. and then one

220
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,840
One day Osama accidentally transmitted the message on an unsecured radio

221
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,240
If I talk to Signal somewhere, then it's about Osama

222
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,560
Voice was also captured in it. The actual one is Jalal

223
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
There was a man named who was imitating Osama's voice for 7 years

224
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,320
I was studying. So he heard the voice

225
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
Confirmation given that this was Osama's speech

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
Pattern and Arabic dialect. now as soon as

227
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,600
When all these details are collected then its

228
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,680
Next Day All Intel US Virginia

229
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
where the CIA head quarters are

230
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,120
It is sent. He has collected all the intelligence

231
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
collected the data and put it into a

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,880
Convert to Electronic Battle Field Map

233
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,959
Did it. That means, as much as they

234
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,120
By observing the intelligence data

235
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,360
Made a map of it. and then the same map

236
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,320
Using the US Secret Delta Force

237
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Which was led by Major Dalton Fury.

238
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,519
He took the Northern Alliance with him.

239
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,680
Kept 70 soldiers and a CIA team with him

240
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,519
and headed towards Torabora to capture Osama

241
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,240
Reached for it. Now as soon as the Delta of the US

242
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,920
When the force reached the hill of Torabora, 3

243
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,399
of the US from December 2001 to 7 December 2001

244
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,600
Delta Force hits Tora Bora nonstop

245
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,600
Dropped £700,000 by the day. but his

246
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
Even later it was not known that Osama

247
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,320
Where is it, after all? Now understand Osama from here

248
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,160
I had come to think that he would get stuck here like this

249
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,000
And the US Delta Force knows about it

250
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,080
that Osama is here. So it comes back like this

251
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,160
I will not go. So Osama had an unsecured

252
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,000
Through radio transmission, Afghan

253
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,080
The Northern Alliance which is based in Torabora, US

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,160
She had come along with me. with him in this unsecured

255
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,320
Started talking through radio signal.

256
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,399
He said that he is ready to surrender.

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,480
But he and his companions came down and surrendered.

258
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,920
You will be able to do it only when you people stop dropping bombs

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
will you do it. So that means to say that he is

260
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,839
One day ceasefire was declared during the conversation

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
He was demanding that he surrender only then

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,920
Will get it. Now the CIA team is not sure

263
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Was. He and Surety really wanted that

264
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,360
Will Osama do this or not? So the one who

265
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,600
The radio that Osama and his companions

266
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,920
They had conversion through signals

267
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
and Osama knew that

268
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Whatever Osama could do through his fighters

269
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,360
He is having a conversation on this radio

270
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,240
The US is listening. So he said that radio

271
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,399
Whatever we talked about in the conversation was all about this

272
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,640
did it in a way that the CIA team

273
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
Get confirmation that you have really surrendered

274
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,360
are going to. And then the CIA guys did Osama's

275
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
They fall into the trap and on 11 December

276
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,000
They tell the Northern Alliance that Osama

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,040
Talk and get the deal done. and the next day i.e.

278
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,680
that on December 12, Osama was surrendered

279
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,399
Had to do it. But as many time bombings as stopped

280
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,320
During that time Osama prepared his escape route

281
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,040
and took his bodyguard to Pakistan

282
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,279
fled on horses and mules toward the

283
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,360
After this suddenly Osama's family

284
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,120
She too would have disappeared inside Afghanistan

285
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,120
Is. Now nobody knows where he went

286
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Was. This was a huge opportunity that the US had in its hands

287
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,519
departed from

288
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,079
Was. Now after this Osama is out of the hands of US

289
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,880
It had gone out. but in the same week that is

290
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,279
On December 19, 2001, an Afghan CIA

291
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,600
Mukhtar was the informer. to him again

292
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,600
Intelligence comes that Osama's family

293
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
has reached Pakistan. so the idea from this

294
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,519
It was alleged that if his family was from Pakistan

295
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
If it has reached then Osama is also in Pakistan

296
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,079
It must be somewhere. And then the US

297
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,760
Together we find Osama in Pakistan

298
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,320
Turned it on. And actually this input is correct

299
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,360
was also there. Osama is Pakistan's federal

300
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,040
Administered Tribal Area (FATA) which was

301
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,959
I had gone there. This Pakistan's

302
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,519
Osama went to the area because

303
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
Before 2018, this area was a part of Pakistan.

304
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,160
It was a special semi-autonomous region. here

305
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,480
Main stream legal system of Pakistan

306
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,880
Instead, the tribal governance model was in place. And

307
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
This here is Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan,

308
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,920
The Haqqani Network and Lashkar Jangvi, LeJ which

309
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,920
This was a very strong hold of his.

310
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,920
who kept Osama here and this

311
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,600
After reaching the area, Osama

312
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,680
The entire strategy was changed. outside of

313
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,680
any kind of contact with the world

314
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,160
That was it, it was cut. Even the first one

315
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,000
al-Qaeda members and guards who were

316
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
I used to talk to those who communicate

317
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,760
He had cut that too. Anyone

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
Didn't know either. Even Al-Qaeda

319
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,839
Even the members did not know that Osama and his

320
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
Where is the family? osama and his family

321
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,680
Whatever they were, they stayed hidden and the outside world

322
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
Daily need to contact with,

323
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,880
All the work of security and logistics

324
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,200
Ibrahim Al Kuwaiti used to do it. this is al qaeda

325
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,760
and was the trustee of the Radio, Satellite

326
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,480
Osama away from phone, internet and everything else

327
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,639
Writes daily letters to communicate

328
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,279
who used to go to al-Qaeda and he was in that

329
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,000
He used to sign his name with a code name Ajammaraye

330
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,639
Was. And Ibrahim Osama's work as a courier

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,720
I used to do it and the messages that were there would go further

332
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
Al Qaeda had different networks

333
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,399
I used to deliver it and from there it was decided that

334
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,880
What should Al Qaeda do next? This whole

335
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,959
electronic part in the chain of communication

336
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
It was also not used. just an exception

337
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,440
He had done it. if something was urgent

338
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,760
So Ibrahim was logged into Gmail for that.

339
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
I used to do it. I used to write a message in draft

340
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,399
And those who were members of Al Qaeda also had

341
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
Same was the password for Gmail. they log in

342
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,320
And then I would open the same draft and read it.

343
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,560
But they did not send it to each other. So

344
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,399
Now this is how Osama and his family can hide

345
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,399
started living there and their communication and other

346
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,320
Ibrahim had all the necessities

347
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,480
I kept handling it. and then after some time when

348
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
Osama's work etc. was similar to that of Ibrahim

349
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,800
It became difficult to handle alone. So

350
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,760
Ibrahim took permission from the leadership of Al Qaeda

351
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,399
Osama also took his brother Abar al Kuwaiti with him

352
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,399
Got a courier made for Rs. So now give it from here

353
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,720
People had become Osama's couriers. that area

354
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,639
Ibrahim and Abar were both inside

355
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,959
If they lived alone together, people would get suspicious

356
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,959
Could have done. So if it feels like a family then this

357
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,440
Because of this, both of them were also married.

358
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,440
He was married to 14 year old Bushra and Maryam

359
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,360
This was done so that all these people could live a normal life

360
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,760
Looked like a Pashto family. now here it is

361
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,800
Osama was living secretly in this manner. There itself

362
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,279
On the other hand, on a daily basis, the US

363
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
The agencies were trying to find Osama

364
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,000
was following the method. The whole of Pakistan

365
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,760
Osama's army was in the FATA region

366
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,839
Big prizes were announced above

367
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,320
That even the smallest details are taken care of. if any

368
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,000
If he tells, he will get a reward. and this thing every

369
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,240
If it reaches someone, then the shops which

370
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,920
Matchboxes were available with prize printed on them too

371
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
It was done that whatever was said about Osama

372
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,399
Anyone who tells anything will get $5 million.

373
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
Along with this, the CI has also inspected the entire area.

374
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,880
There are some private mobile companies like

375
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,639
AT&T, Sprint, Variy with one

376
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,120
A secret agreement was also signed.

377
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,279
In which whatever is in the entire FATA area

378
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,600
Shops selling mobile phones and computers

379
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,240
They put a secret chip in it and started selling it

380
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,160
Were. So that when Al Qaeda people buy that phone

381
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,160
So, they should be tracked. because such

382
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,160
And no other clue was found. but this

383
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,399
The whole thing failed because

384
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,880
Osama completely switched to electronic mode

385
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,480
It was kept closed. Now year after year goes by

386
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
and there was a lot of pressure on the CIA team

387
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,399
There was pressure and they were getting frustrated

388
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,800
Were. So now after some time what will the CIA do?

389
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,120
does it? She tries to make sure that she has someone of her own

390
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,800
The guy is thinking of planting her in Al-Qaeda

391
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,560
Because he realised it only then

392
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,000
Something will be found out about Osama. So

393
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:54,160
Humam al-Balawi alias Abu

394
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Dujana was a doctor by the name of Al Qaeda

395
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,079
He was caught because of his links with . So

396
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
The CIA catches him and says that you are our

397
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
Become a double agent. You just know that

398
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,120
to find out where Osama is and further

399
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,560
Your whole life is free

400
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,399
will go. You won't go to any jail. and then

401
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
If he says yes to this thing then it is a

402
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,560
After getting some training and then

403
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,560
News is spread that Balawi is

404
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,880
Has escaped from the hands of the CIA. Now from here

405
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,040
Its job was to win the trust of Al Qaeda.

406
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,120
Does the CIA know anything about Osama?

407
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,199
If you want to go, tell the CIA. Balawi who was

408
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,760
Did exactly as the CIA said.

409
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,680
It won the trust of al-Qaeda and small

410
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,680
Started giving input. and then some of it

411
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,920
Later it told the CIA that al-Qaeda

412
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,519
He needed a doctor like that. To them its

413
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
There is a lot of trust above. of al-Qaeda

414
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,079
to treat the mastermind Al Jawahari

415
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,000
The task was given to him. all these medical

416
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,519
also sends reports etc. and the CIA

417
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,920
She becomes very happy. and then its

418
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,480
A few days later it was sent to the CIA by a secured

419
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,399
Tells through the network that it was Osama

420
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,959
Know very important thing about

421
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,800
It has gone away. So the CIA could catch Osama

422
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,120
will take it. and then it says I'll give you

423
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,959
I will tell you the details. You please set me free.

424
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,279
But he did not tell me all these details over the phone.

425
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,600
I can tell you only after meeting you. The CIA

426
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,920
This was kept in Chapman's most secured camp

427
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,160
She calls me secretly. Same Week Balawi's

428
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,160
It was also a birthday. So the CIA team is so happy

429
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
That he had made a surprise cake for Balawi

430
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,839
It was also kept that as soon as he came, he would get information about Osama

431
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,759
I will tell you then everyone will come together and make a cake

432
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,519
and all the CIA personnel inside this camp

433
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,920
Only senior officers used to live there. Now from here

434
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
Balawi who was there comes. of the whole camp

435
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
The security around was very tight

436
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Was. Everyone is being checked at the first check post

437
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
Was. But the CIA ordered Balawi to be checked.

438
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,519
was refused. at the second check post too

439
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,199
There was no checking of this. said it straight

440
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,160
I said let him come forward. Now all the

441
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,839
CIA caught the security guards and escaped freely

442
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,079
reaches the camp of. where the CIA's

443
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,720
The top leadership was waiting for him today

444
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,279
Osama's location will be revealed. and Balawi

445
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,000
Meets with all the CIA officers.

446
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,480
He extends both hands and blows himself up

447
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,880
gives

448
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,600
Is. Balawi was their double agent.

449
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,320
It was not made. He had made a plan with Al Qaeda

450
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,560
On the contrary, all the officers in this camp were

451
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,600
A plan was made to kill him. this a

452
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,360
Seven CIA officers were killed in the blast and a total of 16

453
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,680
People were killed. in the history of the CIA

454
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,600
This had never happened before. and osama's location

455
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,439
Because of this whole plan, let alone meeting

456
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,439
If the entire leadership of the CIA was blown away then this

457
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,039
After the incident, the effort to find Osama began.

458
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,199
There was a process, that too had slowed down. Now

459
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,360
After this, new leadership of CIA came.

460
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,439
Osama's health was also very good

461
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,439
It was down. So the Al Qaeda people are Osama's

462
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,600
I was looking for a secure place for myself. and beans

463
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,160
On time they were sent to Aabad, Pakistan

464
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,839
Pay for a plot near the Military Academy

465
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,480
The sale board is visible written. Them

466
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,880
It seemed that it was Pakistan's cantonment area

467
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,720
It is nearby. If Osama stays here then

468
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,760
No one will suspect. So immediately after that

469
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,480
Abrar is sent and Abrar withdraws $50 cash

470
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,640
With Leke and Fake ID it's $38000

471
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
I bought this plot of square feet

472
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Takes it. immediately after that the local

473
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,799
Architect Mohammed Younis was hired

474
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,880
He started building more houses and

475
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,240
The house was ready within a year i.e. by 2006.

476
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,480
and in 2006 Osama, Abrar,

477
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,640
The family of all three Ibrahim shifted here

478
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
It happens. All work outside the home

479
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,880
Sending letters etc. to Al Qaeda, communication

480
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,520
Maintenance etc and further planning

481
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,760
to do. Abar and Ibrahim used to do the courier

482
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,080
Banke and inside the house of Abar and Ibrahim

483
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,160
The wife used to cook food etc. and

484
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,919
she used to do all the other work and Osama was

485
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,000
He remained hidden inside this compound all the time

486
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,120
Was. Now Osama had shifted here and

487
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,360
The US will not be given any information about his location for the next 5 years.

488
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,880
I cannot tell. Now after this comes the date

489
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,960
27th of August 2010 and on this day the CIA

490
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,600
I had no idea that for so many years

491
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,679
He is working day and night to find her

492
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,760
Today he is going to meet them by deceit.

493
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,840
What happens is that Osama's most trusted

494
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,000
The courier whose name was Ibrahim was called

495
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,799
I had to go to Peshawar city for some work

496
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,200
and already inside the whole Peshawar city which

497
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,919
There were signals, they were on the CIA's radar. Now

498
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,760
General Ibrahim talks in areas like Peshawar

499
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,480
uses a secure method to do so

500
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,400
Was. But that day, due to laziness, he went to Peshawar

501
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,880
Standing in a public area of ​​your

502
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,320
Some information was received from Al-Qaeda members through personal phone

503
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,640
He talks for seconds. Now

504
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,720
Ibrahim made this phone call

505
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,799
Because of this the CIA immediately arrested Ibrahim's live

506
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,200
Tracks the location and where you are standing

507
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,799
Ibrahim made a call from there

508
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,640
reaches, and after reaching

509
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,799
Tri does not catch Ibrahim but

510
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,640
that by following Ibrahim he should go further

511
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,960
The locations can also be traced

512
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,919
Could. Now after this Ibrahim is back with his white

513
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,640
Suzuki Potaur Gp with Rear Spare

514
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,799
There was a Renault built on the tyre, I was sitting in it

515
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,720
He starts walking and from here the CIA agents

516
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,720
Those who were there started chasing it

517
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,559
Are. For a long time, the CIA was Ibrahim

518
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
chases the car and then runs away for a while

519
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,919
After some time Ibrahim came to his car

520
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,760
There is a Bilal Town in Apata.

521
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,240
takes a turn and goes a little further

522
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,240
There was a very big compound there after that

523
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,320
Ibrahim enters inside with his jeep.

524
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,919
Now the CI team that was standing outside stopped

525
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Let's start discussing that

526
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,400
What to do next? Mainly these people are thinking

527
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,400
instead of going in directly, I was waiting for a few days

528
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,240
This compound should be tracked till

529
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,200
Where did Ibrahim go after leaving from here

530
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,360
and with his help it may reach Osama

531
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
Can reach. Now when these CIA people are talking to each other

532
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,440
While they were discussing, their attention was on Ibrahim

533
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,280
fell on the compound he had entered and that

534
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
When he looked at the compound carefully,

535
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,360
That compound seemed a bit strange to him.

536
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,440
It is completed in about 38,000 square feet

537
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,240
A compound was made. But such a large compound

538
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,799
There was only one main entry and the walls

539
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
Which was its 18 feet high boundary

540
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,280
had been made all around and around those boundaries

541
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,720
Barb wire was also installed on top and the upper

542
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,559
These people seeing the floor and more

543
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,120
I was surprised. there were no windows and

544
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,200
There was a balcony and a 7 feet boundary was made in it

545
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,880
Had kept it. Generally if you look at the balcony then

546
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,799
There is no such high boundary in it

547
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,640
He gets it done. So after seeing all these things,

548
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,799
There is a doubt that this much is for Ibrahim

549
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,960
All the arrangements might not have been made. Sure

550
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,720
There is no high value in this with Ibrahim

551
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,559
There could be a target that can lead to Osama.

552
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,240
Because these people were sure that

553
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,240
Osama will not be in this compound. Because

554
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,159
There, at some distance, the Pakistani military

555
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
There was also an academy. Osama is not that big a risk

556
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,240
will take that near pakistan military academy

557
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,480
He built a house and started living there. They thought that

558
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,720
This is somewhere in a cave or somewhere in the mountains

559
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
It will happen in. now the next day again this

560
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,320
These people reach near the compound. These

561
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,159
People can also do activities that take place inside the compound.

562
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
Let us start observing them.

563
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
And when more details about this compound

564
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,400
If you find out, you will be even more surprised

565
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,400
These people go away. They found out that in the past 5

566
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,039
People who have been living inside this compound for years

567
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,960
the houses that are around, the people that are

568
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,760
He did not have any dealings with anyone. And

569
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,840
At that time, there were no wired phone lines inside homes.

570
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,480
It used to happen. So there is no phone inside this compound

571
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,159
There was no line. Internet, technology

572
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,919
These people were not using any such thing. These

573
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,240
It was completely a military area. even then here

574
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
There is no surveillance camera or anything else.

575
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,919
It was engaged in this area and the people around

576
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,000
And he said something indirectly to the children

577
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,159
When they tried to find out things, these people

578
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He told that he is very rich. One

579
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,760
The ball went off while the kids were playing cricket

580
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,400
I went inside the compound. So he played the ball

581
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,039
did not return but won in his place

582
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,520
I gave them 10 times the price of the ball.

583
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,440
Now CIA agents took all these details

584
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,679
The director who was there at that time

585
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,720
Punita writes this email to him. that email

586
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,480
The title was Closing in on Osama Belades

587
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,240
Courier. Mainly in this entire email he

588
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,559
It was written that this compound is normal

589
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,799
Not there. We have a feeling this could also be the case

590
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,280
There must be Osama inside it. now when this email

591
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,120
Leon Panetta gets that one right away

592
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Create a presentation and

593
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,679
After making the constitution, this happened directly to President Barack Obama.

594
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,679
They reach out to Obama and see one like this

595
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,400
The compound has been found inside Pakistan

596
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,559
Is. The team believes that Osama is inside it

597
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,799
It may be possible and for this we need to

598
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
Tell Pakistan a list of the entire compound

599
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,720
Investigation will have to be started. So this

600
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,799
But Obama says that even though this compound

601
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,640
It is inside Pakistan. Pakistan without you

602
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,720
Tell him something and start your work. Now

603
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,600
As soon as we get the go ahead from the White House

604
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,600
It was just the beginning of September 2010. these people

605
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Efforts were made to find out about this compound

606
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,159
Let's go. And all these people together

607
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,880
A common document was prepared which was named

608
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,360
Anatomy of a Lead. The details which are there in this

609
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,520
It was found related to the compound, in this

610
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,200
People used to add it. no matter how small it is

611
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Why not? Now when these people get this compound

612
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
They were tracking and in the meanwhile they got to know about it

613
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,159
It happens that in between, in this compound which

614
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,240
Women live by using a phone

615
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,559
Sometimes we talk and to talk about that

616
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,600
During this time she lies that she is in Kuwait

617
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,760
Are. While this was the same person from APTA of Pakistan

618
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,840
Inside the compound. these basics for many days

619
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,400
Information which is from far away from this compound

620
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,120
and November

621
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,120
In 2010, the CIA team that was working for the US

622
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,520
She was sitting inside and she reaches Obama

623
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,440
that there were many chances of Osama being in this compound

624
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,520
There are strong chances. We must have this

625
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,600
Some action should be taken on the compound.

626
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,679
There are very high chances that Osama

627
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,600
You will find it inside. Now Obama, all these details

628
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,039
After listening to this they ask you,

629
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,960
How strong a feeling are you saying?

630
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,159
It is strong. You tell me in percentage. So

631
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,880
John said at that time that 90% of his team

632
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,840
said 80% and the deputy director of the CIA

633
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,600
Michael Morell said 60% and then after that

634
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,000
Obama said that this compound is

635
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,760
It is inside Pakistan. if we take any action

636
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,440
If you want to do it then there are some more possibilities

637
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,679
Will have to explore. This can also happen

638
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,679
that instead of Osama some Gulf Sheikh would run away

639
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,080
living there or it could be someone else

640
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,559
Is. And even by mistake we took some action and

641
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,720
If someone else takes Osama's place, we can afford it

642
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,320
Can't do it. Very bad reputation

643
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
And relations with Pakistan will also deteriorate

644
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,559
Will be. Now from here the CIA analyst

645
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,799
The team understood that and

646
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,559
details need to be collected if this compound

647
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,200
Some action has to be done above. It seems to them that

648
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,840
thought that Osama was inside it but they

649
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,080
Proof was needed and for that these people decided

650
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,640
Let's say this compound in Apatabad

651
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,880
Some observation posts will have to be built near it

652
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,720
And any local guy who is trustworthy

653
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
will also have to be included. Otherwise, this compound

654
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,799
The details are not available correctly

655
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,279
I will get it. So the CIA team that was in his past

656
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,240
The relation was that of a retired Pakistani

657
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,799
Lieutenant Colonel Syed was an army officer

658
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Iqbal's past relation with the CIA team

659
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,880
They were very good. He served as lieutenant

660
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,840
Colonel Said Iqbal was given the responsibility of the entire compound.

661
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,919
and said that secretly in this

662
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,400
They need help with this. Now this lieutenant

663
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,120
Colonel Syed Iqbal was a friend of

664
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,760
Dr Aamir Aziz whose house is this compound

665
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,240
he was just 80 yards away from him

666
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,240
And from its roof, there are many doors inside the compound.

667
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,799
Locations were visible. So the CIA team

668
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,120
This retired Lieutenant Colonel Syed Iqbal

669
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,919
decided to send Aamir home and then

670
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,520
Syed Iqbal reached Aamir's house shortly after

671
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,520
So he talks about this and that. then he says

672
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,440
I'd like to meet your dog.

673
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,000
The dogs that were actually inside Aamir's house

674
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,720
He was on the roof. And on the pretext of meeting these dogs

675
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,279
Retired Lieutenant Colonel Syed Iqbal Chhat

676
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,440
and from the top of the same roof it

677
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,200
I took multiple photos of the compound

678
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,799
He takes the photo and gives it to the CIA.

679
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,440
He brings it and gives it to me. Related to this compound

680
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,679
Added all the details that were available

681
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,080
was going and its task was to

682
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,240
had a separate team which was led by Gina Bennett

683
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
doing

684
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,760
Was. This team was responsible for this whole

685
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,520
Making an actual layout of the compound. as much as

686
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,440
Small details are being collected

687
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,320
By doing this and then in the same week he

688
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,799
There is also an office 1 mile away from the compound

689
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,799
Took this office on rent and turned it into a CIA camp

690
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,039
Made it. All the meetings that took place

691
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,200
She used to be in this same office which was the CIA's

692
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,360
He used to act like a camp. this whole area

693
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,679
When I reached the compound where it was

694
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,440
When these CIA analysts used to go, the voice

695
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,240
At that time, in order to not let it get too much, he

696
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,400
I used to drive a Lexis coach car, I took it

697
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,640
And these people used to sit in it and go and inspect

698
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,760
He used to do it for the whole area. The CIA analyst

699
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,000
that the whole team was in this for even a second

700
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,159
Keep the entire compound away from your monitoring

701
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,159
I didn’t do it. to track down this compound

702
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,880
For this he used infrared camera and night vision.

703
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,039
Vision cameras were installed to protect against human heat

704
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,360
thermal images can be collected and night

705
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,360
Track all movements at night with vision camera

706
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,679
and make a report. To them

707
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,080
One thing was known that whatever these

708
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,840
there are people, what time do they eat, what time

709
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,240
Do you sleep and at what time do you come to visit?

710
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,559
All the popular trees around the compound

711
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,960
There were, listing devices were installed in all of them

712
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,279
so that if anything happens by mistake then

713
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,279
Let it be heard. Now and then December 2010

714
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,200
it had started and till now they

715
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,200
Whatever details were collected. from that

716
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,360
They had come to know so much that this compound

717
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,840
20 to 22 people live inside. in which

718
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,200
They thought that it was Osama and Osama

719
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,360
has three wives and children Iqbal and Abar who

720
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,440
Yes, his family is living inside it. And

721
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,159
Along with this, they also found out that

722
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,720
Every day a man is taken out from inside this compound

723
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,440
sends written notes which Ibrahim as a

724
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,000
becomes a courier and delivers it forward and in this way

725
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,240
All the fighters in the entire Al Qaeda

726
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,159
etc., they used to get the message and then further

727
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,320
The planning was decided. The CIA team

728
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,039
I was very sure that this type of

729
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,559
Osama himself sent the message from inside the compound

730
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,279
can send it but they have no proof

731
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,360
It was not there. The CIA team is there day and night, just that one

732
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,679
I was trying to find the proof, after which

733
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,000
It can be sent to USA and then this compound

734
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,840
Some action plan should be made against Osama

735
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,919
should be caught. now after that in december

736
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,000
By last week, the CIA team

737
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,159
She was monitoring on daily basis

738
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,159
Noticed some activity on . of this compound

739
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,440
The top floor inside has a

740
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,120
The tall man comes to the balcony and walks briskly

741
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,279
does it for a while and then goes inside

742
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,360
He goes to the balcony and puts up shades etc.

743
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,520
Such arrangements were made that the long

744
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,919
The man's face was not visible. just the wall

745
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,760
The shadow of that man was visible above and Osama's

746
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,320
His height was also 6 feet 4 inches. So

747
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,520
CI team just on the basis of that shadow

748
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,360
the wall and the shadow that was there

749
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,039
Prepared a report by calculating the ratio. But

750
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,880
The exact height is not mentioned in that report either

751
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,360
Pie. A range came. it came in that report

752
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,320
The height of the man who walks is 5 foot 5

753
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,320
It can range from 8 inches to 6 feet 8 inches.

754
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,240
So this range turns out to be very long, so this

755
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,240
Also they are unable to reach any conclusion.

756
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,399
But the entire CIA team was on a conclusion.

757
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,720
had reached that this tall man who is in this

758
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,120
He comes to the compound every day and roams around in the balcony

759
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,000
Is. He is the head of this entire compound.

760
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,399
because there was this one man in that 20 to 25

761
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,320
among the people who were working around

762
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,320
I never helped them. So from this

763
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,880
The CIA team had found out that this

764
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,799
Main is a man and he could be Osama also

765
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,120
Who is living on the top floor. Now after this

766
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,000
The CIA team decides among themselves

767
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,000
that if by digging inside the ground, this

768
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,080
If access to the compound's sewage is obtained

769
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,919
DNA will be found from human waste and then

770
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,159
There will be assurance that Osama is in this compound

771
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,720
Is it inside or not. who was osama's father

772
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,360
He married 22 times and had 56 brothers

773
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,440
She was a sister. So the CIA team already has it

774
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,520
It was the DNA of Osama's family. And

775
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,279
This was the plan to reach the sewage

776
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,960
These people also extend it for several days. and then

777
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,200
At last they reach this conclusion

778
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,120
that there is so much digging inside the ground and

779
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,960
If there is a movement then the people inside the compound

780
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,360
they will get suspicious and stay for 10 years

781
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,279
After all this was the only chance to catch Osama

782
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,039
I have got it but I am afraid it might slip out of my hands. So

783
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,679
They drop this plan but

784
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,440
After this the CIA team does something new.

785
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,159
What happens is that inside Pakistan there is a

786
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,320
There was a local doctor whose name was Shakeel Afridi.

787
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,880
Now this doctor has a secret of the CIA

788
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,880
The operative was Kate. go to them and

789
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
says it is a program called Save the Child

790
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,440
She runs an NGO in which all the poor

791
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,279
there are children, they are helped and then they

792
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,000
The doctor puts a proposal in front of Afridi

793
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,080
is that apt is here to give money to kids

794
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,840
hepatitis B due to deficiency of

795
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
The vaccine is not being administered and

796
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Their NGO is for the poor of this area.

797
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,679
hepatitis B vaccine for children

798
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,399
Wants to run a vaccination campaign.

799
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,399
Actually the CIA's plan was that

800
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,320
This compound is being used under the pretext of vaccination

801
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,880
Will go inside. Their children are being harassed under the same pretext

802
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,880
The DNA will be found and it will reveal that

803
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,640
Is Osama inside or not? in the beginning so

804
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
Doctor Afridi is so interesting

805
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,440
do not show it. But this is what the C.I.A.

806
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,279
The secret operative was getting this from his colleague

807
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,279
She introduces him to Doctor Afridi. Tell more

808
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,440
what do you do? Doctor Afridi's Personal

809
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,960
in the account

810
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,360
transfers $55,000

811
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,440
Are. Now after getting the money Afridi is without

812
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,120
Use your mind on vaccination work

813
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,120
Let's start it. Afridi absolutely

814
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,520
I had no idea that she was going to spend the most

815
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,000
You are going to make a big mistake. Afridi has

816
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,399
Without thinking anything there was a Job nearby

817
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,799
There was a medical college. From there nurses and health

818
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,720
Care workers recruited and new

819
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,640
In the area from to Bilal Town

820
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,399
Vaccination drive has started. Everywhere

821
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,960
I put up posters saying it's very good

822
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,279
Quality Mson vaccine will be administered this

823
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,039
Children inside the area. now for the vaccine

824
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,880
The drive starts and Dr Afridi

825
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,039
Near the same compound with his team

826
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,960
The CA people wait for them eagerly

827
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,120
been doing this for days and after reaching

828
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,440
He plays the bell like Doctor Afridi etc.

829
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,919
Ibrahim comes out and chases them all away.

830
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,200
Gives. This is what Sue and Kate say

831
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,520
People try many times from phone also

832
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,600
By taking out the number from here and there but there

833
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,760
It also does not work out and this thing about the CIA

834
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,440
The plan that was there also fails. Now the doctor

835
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,000
Afridi drove because of money

836
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,159
did but they did not know that it

837
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,799
What was USA making them do behind this and

838
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,799
Due to a mistake Dr Afridi got 33 runs

839
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,480
Was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. Even today this jail

840
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,960
There is a name of betrayal against Pakistan

841
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,960
Pay. Now after this plan fails the CIA

842
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,520
She starts exploring other things

843
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,679
So that more details can be obtained. on the other side

844
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,840
A different story is going on inside this compound.

845
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,320
Was being. Inside the compound, Ibrahim and

846
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,720
Abrar, this person has been there for the past several years

847
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,200
Daily inside this compound, hiding

848
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,039
I was tired while doing the activity. Their

849
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,039
My health had deteriorated a lot. to ibrahim

850
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,960
I had cancer and had become very weak

851
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,039
Ibrahim. And now the thing was that he was depressed

852
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,880
Medicines were being used and this vaccine guy

853
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,440
The incident happened a few days after that

854
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,360
Ibrahim and Abar were with Osama

855
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,039
we go and tell them that we are like this

856
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,960
I am tired of running around and now I am stuck in this compound

857
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,880
He won't be able to stay here. So Osama is talking about this

858
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,159
He understands and says that this year

859
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,320
The attack we carried out on 11th of September 2011

860
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,320
It's its 10th anniversary in USA.

861
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,880
So wait till this date and after that

862
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,320
You guys can buy a retirement house in Jedda.

863
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,240
Lena and I will also leave from here and go to this

864
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,880
Will sell the compound. So it means to say

865
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,120
that now only a few months were left for Osama to die

866
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,000
to leave the compound and the C.I.A.

867
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,080
If he had delayed any longer, Osama might have been killed again

868
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,559
They do not get it for many years. And this which

869
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,880
The CIA was also aware of this

870
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,880
It was realised that for a long time

871
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,679
If you wait then Osama will leave from here

872
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,000
Will go. So till this particular time one more thing

873
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,799
It happened that whatever details were available

874
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,200
using all of that and satellite images etc.

875
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,519
which was by using other technologies

876
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,919
CIA analyst Gina Bennett who was

877
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,760
He prepared the layout of the whole compound.

878
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,360
Had you figured out which thing is where?

879
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
Where are the stairs? how many of that

880
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,919
Are there steps? Where is the car parked? every

881
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,600
What is the height of the wall from the angle? it

882
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,679
All things were mentioned in this document.

883
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,640
And he named this document

884
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,880
Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSC) and

885
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,000
All the people living inside the compound

886
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,679
Every member of Osama, Ibrahim, Abrar

887
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,279
He had made a card. this is his

888
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,200
This is the original copy. You can see it in this

889
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,279
Which floor are you living on? his height

890
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,600
How much is it? Every detail is mentioned. and this

891
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,240
After completion of the document, Gina

892
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,640
who was 100% sure that Osama was this

893
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,720
It is inside the compound. and the rest of the team too

894
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,799
wanted that now action should take place inside this compound

895
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,120
Should be. Otherwise for the last 10 years,

896
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,960
They are after Osama again

897
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,360
It will go out of their hands. now its next day

898
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,519
Top CIA analyst Leon Panetta, Admiral

899
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,880
McRaven, Mike Mullan, James Cartridge and

900
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,799
Pentagon's counter-terrorism adviser Michael

901
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,720
Vickers in the Situation Room of the White House

902
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,960
arrives and has a meeting with Obama

903
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,200
Are. Even before this meeting he had

904
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,279
Help of Geospatial Intelligence Agencies

905
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,760
I made a model of the entire compound from it.

906
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,600
In which each thing is mentioned floor by floor

907
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,679
Was. Like it was actually in the compound. And

908
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,240
All these people got together in this meeting

909
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,240
Let me confirm that we need to take action now.

910
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,799
And Obama too agreed to this.

911
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,799
They do it. This whole team that was Obama

912
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,799
The first option it puts before us is that we

913
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,679
By air in Pakistan's airspace

914
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,600
We will enter and spread B2 over this entire compound

915
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,079
We will strike with a bomber. as big as

916
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,159
This is a compound, total 24 bombs will be used and any

917
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,839
US commandos also risk their lives

918
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,760
Will not done. But this option that they

919
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,079
He told me that there are problems in this

920
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,159
that there is a big destruction in this whole area

921
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,040
This will happen due to which the lives of the civilians will also be saved.

922
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,960
May go. A small earthquake nearby

923
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,440
It can also come and this is also a possibility

924
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,599
It is possible that we may never know that Osama

925
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,919
Was he there or not? because of the DNA

926
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,399
There are chances that the evidence will also be destroyed

927
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,159
In this. And the biggest problem with this was that

928
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,399
Reputation will be damaged worldwide.

929
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,960
Relations with Pakistan will deteriorate and we

930
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,879
to strike at another country

931
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,119
It will be very difficult to defend what is

932
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,280
And if any civilian dies by mistake then

933
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,520
The problems will become bigger. second option

934
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,359
He said that precise drone attack

935
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,599
Can be done. But even in this they

936
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,839
Explained the problem. This is an option that

937
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,679
Osama's chances of escaping from there

938
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,680
It's too much and the US is not going to do anything this time

939
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,440
Didn't want to miss the opportunity. For 10 years he

940
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,760
Was waiting for this thing. a discussion this

941
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,240
It also happened that together with Pakistan, Butterl

942
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,320
The operation can be done. But Obama has

943
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,240
It was clearly refused that under any circumstances

944
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,160
I should not let Pakistan know that

945
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,119
What are we going to do? and then its

946
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,680
Afterwards, this whole discussion took place. So the admiral

947
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,560
Mac Raven said the best option was

948
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,720
It would happen that without our special team

949
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,680
Inform Pakistan about this compound

950
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,480
Go inside and identify Osama from the front

951
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,040
By doing this, kill yourself and do something to anyone around you.

952
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,440
I won't be able to find out. Quietly Special Forces

953
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,920
I will go, do my work and come back after doing it

954
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,000
Will go. And that was a good thing about this option.

955
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,560
that in case Osama is not in the compound

956
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,040
If found then it will be very easy to suppress this matter.

957
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,520
The only negative thing in this option was that as many

958
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,599
The officers will also risk their lives

959
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,079
will remain. Now after hearing all these details

960
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,560
Obama thinks for a while and then

961
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,520
The world's most risky operation in which

962
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,920
Navy SEAL officer did this without informing Pakistan

963
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,160
I will go to the compound and kill Osama myself.

964
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,240
Let us give go ahead for this operation. And

965
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,200
This operation was named Operation

966
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,359
Neptune Spare.

967
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,280
Neptune was kept spare because

968
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,440
The Navy Seals team had to go for this operation

969
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,520
and Neptune names their sea

970
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,839
used to represent heritage and meant spare

971
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,760
There is a spear which is precise and effective

972
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,440
It is a symbol of attack. so now from here it

973
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,599
So it was decided that in this compound

974
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,440
Have to take action. but not much time

975
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,320
could have been used for preparation

976
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,079
Because Osama could have run away and the Admiral

977
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,640
McCraven, who was there, introduced Obama

978
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,960
I had given the assurance that somehow I would be able to get three

979
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,720
He will do all the preparations in a week and

980
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,720
As soon as this meeting is over

981
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,880
Everyone is in preparation from the next day itself

982
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,599
It starts happening. The best officer in the US

983
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,560
were needed and then after multiple discussions

984
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,480
Navy SEAL Team Six's Red Squadron

985
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,079
They were selected for this operation

986
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,480
do. The best part of this whole operation

987
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,359
The helicopter was a very important part

988
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,240
He remained at low height to escape from Pakistan's radar

989
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:57,599
To handle and carry it. For this

990
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,839
US Army's 160th Special Operations Division

991
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,599
The pilots of the regiment were taken away. it's like this

992
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,880
are considered best for such situations.

993
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,960
So in this way total 24 officers were selected

994
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,880
who were best for this situation and their

995
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,040
The previous record was also very good and this

996
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,119
All the people who were selected, they had to face some trouble

997
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,800
No information was given about this operation either

998
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,720
It was said that he was selected to kill Osama

999
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,280
Has happened. They were simply told that

1000
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,119
One in the area of ​​Afghanistan and Pakistan

1001
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,119
An operation has to be done and preparation for it

1002
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,400
Have to do it. And then all these things happen

1003
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,320
After 10th of April 2011 whatever these

1004
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,720
The officers who were selected were

1005
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,880
They were found in a forest in North Carolina

1006
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,800
is taken to a secret location and when

1007
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,680
When all the officers reached there then their

1008
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,160
There was a compound in front of Apta

1009
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,320
The model was kept and a little distance away from there

1010
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,400
Prepared a compound of the exact same size

1011
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,800
I had gone there so that all these people could prepare

1012
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,119
so that and after this inside this very compound

1013
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,680
that it was an exact replica of the original

1014
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,440
Doing all these compound team practices

1015
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,320
starts and during practice time

1016
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,359
In the same year, he included a Belgian in his team.

1017
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,760
A dog of the breed named Cairo was also

1018
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,839
I added this and this dog also got this daily dose of my

1019
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,160
practice jumping from a helicopter together

1020
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,160
used to do it and post inside this group

1021
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,240
A translator was also kept so that the operation could be carried out

1022
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,240
at the time when these people were being taken out of the compound

1023
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,480
you must be taking them out, you must be catching them so that

1024
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,960
We can talk to them and get the details from them

1025
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,280
So that he can go and then for the next 5 days he remains in the same condition.

1026
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,599
Practicing floor by floor on the model

1027
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,079
and flying the plane at low altitude,

1028
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,119
This unloading is done on daily basis. and then

1029
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,359
After 5 days i.e. on 18th of April 2011

1030
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,079
This whole team was trained by a team from Nevada in the US.

1031
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,920
Taking me to a secret location on the same model

1032
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,240
Practice is done. Because Nevada

1033
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,400
and the temperature and elevation of Afghanistan which

1034
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,000
It was almost the same. So on the one hand these

1035
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,480
People were being trained. The other one

1036
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,880
Other teams were also formed and they too

1037
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,680
Being prepared for different situations

1038
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,359
Was. Like if Osama surrendered

1039
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,599
According to the rule it was that he should not be killed

1040
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,760
Can. He will have to be arrested. So a team

1041
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,400
was created in which lawyers interpreters

1042
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,800
etc. so that after arresting them, they could be handed over to that team

1043
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,359
So that Osama could be brought. and this interrogation

1044
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,520
USS in the Arabian Sea, preparing the team

1045
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,359
Carl Vinson Aircraft Carrier Pay

1046
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,440
Practice was being done and got prepared

1047
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,680
It was being said that in case Osama surrendered

1048
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,440
If he gives it then he will be brought on this aircraft

1049
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,359
will go and this specific team will

1050
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,160
Will do interrogation. then another team

1051
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,560
which was created by Rodes and George Littlehead

1052
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,480
Was doing. The work of this team was to

1053
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,640
What to say to the media after the operation?

1054
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,040
These people are preparing for different scenarios

1055
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,359
Was doing. Like if Osama is killed

1056
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,839
Then what do you have to say to the media? surrenders

1057
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,839
Then what should I say? If Navy SEALs get caught

1058
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,000
or the operation fails. That

1059
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,560
What briefing is to be given to the media in the case?

1060
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,960
This team gave information to the media for every situation

1061
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,640
What to say, how to say it,

1062
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,920
All things were ready. and its

1063
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,160
With Mark Kelton and Ambassador Cameron

1064
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,160
Those who were there also had their two plans ready

1065
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,400
And I submitted it. this was in the plan

1066
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,880
That if the Navy SEALs get stuck somewhere during the operation

1067
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,960
If so, how can you escape? In this he has two

1068
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,119
Having prepared the plan, we headed towards the Indian border

1069
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,640
An exit route was made from. The second one is from Karachi

1070
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,040
He had made an exit plan from his side.

1071
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,040
Where he served on the USS Carl Vincent Ship

1072
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,040
was already posted there. So this

1073
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,960
After getting all the things ready, the rough work that

1074
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,200
The plan that he had made was this

1075
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,440
that this whole team is first from USA

1076
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,000
Afghanistan after taking training etc.

1077
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,000
There is a US airbase in Jalalabad

1078
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,800
I will go and stop there and wait for the orders

1079
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,320
will do it. And in Jalalabad airbase total

1080
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:26,160
Five helicopters Two UA 60 Black Hawk

1081
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,800
Stealth helicopters and three Boeing CH-47

1082
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,800
Chinook helicopters will wait for them. And

1083
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,280
When they get go ahead then these people

1084
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,160
Helicopters can be used in Pakistan's airspace

1085
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,480
By flying at low height to intercept Pakistan's radar

1086
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,400
We will reach the location by escaping from there. this which

1087
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,480
These were helicopters, they were special. To them

1088
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,280
It was also customized. The heat of these

1089
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,520
The signatures were very low. sound very low

1090
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,680
Was. It was very difficult to catch them.

1091
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,160
They had decided that the people of Jalalabad

1092
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,960
In the air space where there are five helicopters

1093
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,280
Will be. One of them is a CH4-47 Chinook

1094
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,359
The helicopter is waiting at the airbase

1095
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,160
This will be done so that there is a need for backup of fuel etc.

1096
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,560
So it was useful. The remaining two CH-47 Chinook

1097
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,359
Those helicopters were from Khyber, Pakistan

1098
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,920
The hills of Pashtun Kala Dhaka Sweat

1099
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,920
we will stay in the area that Osama

1100
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,240
It was 50 miles away from the compound.

1101
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,440
This was also kept as a backup, inside which

1102
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,000
There was a quick reaction team of 24 officers so that

1103
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,400
If heavy retaliation comes from the compound then it

1104
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,520
people should also reach near the compound and the rest

1105
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,400
which two US 60 Black Hawk Stealth

1106
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,480
There were helicopters, their main job was Osama

1107
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,680
to go to the compound and complete the operation

1108
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,920
to do. Along with this RQ 170 Sentinel

1109
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,160
The stealth drone was there to cover the entire compound

1110
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,640
He will be there and monitor everything. So

1111
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,560
He had set this plan and on S

1112
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,359
Plan 26th of April 2011 Whole Team

1113
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,599
Previously in Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan

1114
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,640
It reaches. rests here for a day

1115
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,119
And next day i.e. on 27th of April

1116
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,680
At Jalalabad Airbase in Afghanistan

1117
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,079
The entire team reached there to complete the operation.

1118
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,440
She starts waiting for orders. Now its

1119
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,720
Next day i.e. on 28th of April 2011

1120
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,800
Obama holds meetings and in the morning

1121
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,760
Final approval of the entire operation at 8:20

1122
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,560
I sign it and as soon as it is signed it becomes 38th

1123
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,400
Fix the date of off April 2011

1124
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,280
is given for this operation. but like

1125
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,960
The date is fixed at the same time, the weather

1126
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,200
that the reports that come in start to turn out bad

1127
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,000
Is. On this day fog is more visible. So

1128
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,520
Because of this these people have now changed the date

1129
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,839
Historical date fix for First of May 2011

1130
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,839
Let's do it. Now only one day is left after this

1131
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,079
It was to capture Osama. and then its

1132
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,440
After all the preparations are done finally

1133
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,200
That historic day of First of May 2011 arrived

1134
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,000
The day when the world's most

1135
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,880
A risky operation is about to take place.

1136
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,480
US

1137
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:52,400
Intelligence US Special Unit.

1138
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,400
The time zones of the US and Afghanistan were different.

1139
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,520
So there was a difference in their time. In the US

1140
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,520
The time was 1:22 Eastern Time

1141
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,240
And in Afghanistan it's 11:00 p.m.

1142
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,119
were supposed. and it is made at this specific time

1143
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,200
And McRaven would have started this operation

1144
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,319
Are. Around 2:00 according to USA time

1145
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,880
At this time Obama was playing golf.

1146
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:15,119
came and sat in the Situation Room of the White House

1147
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,400
go and start updating everything

1148
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,640
Let's do it. and on the other side

1149
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,440
It was 11:30 pm in Afghanistan.

1150
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,000
And Osama, after having dinner at night, went to his

1151
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,599
On the upper floor with wife and kids

1152
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,760
He goes to sleep. absolutely to osama

1153
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,680
I had no idea that in the next few hours

1154
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,000
What is going to happen to them? Now after this

1155
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,480
Jalalabad airbase in Afghanistan

1156
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,200
It was where the team was waiting for so long.

1157
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,560
So plan on S one of the five helicopters

1158
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,800
The helicopter was a CH4-47 Chinook helicopter

1159
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,440
He stops there as a backup. the rest of

1160
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,240
The four helicopters were two Chinooks and two

1161
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,240
Black Hawks. This is Pakistan which escapes the radar

1162
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,640
start flying towards swat valley

1163
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,560
We give it. and within 15 minutes

1164
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,560
entering Pakistan's airspace

1165
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,560
We give it. And as soon as the entry is made

1166
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,400
would start flying at a very low height

1167
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,800
Are. And they had Pakistan's radar.

1168
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,920
Can't catch it. Now, after this, these four

1169
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,640
Helicopter reached Swad Valley around 12:00

1170
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,800
they reach there and here two out of four

1171
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,880
Chinook which carried the Quick Reaction Team

1172
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,640
Whereas Pakistan's Kala Dhaka tastes

1173
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,599
Let's stop and wait in the hills. as a

1174
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,680
Backup. Commander Admiral William McRaven

1175
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,680

Was giving an update. and the officers and the drones that

1178
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,319
There were cameras installed in it. So the camera's

1179
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,400
Because inside the situation room, Obama and his

1180
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,359
The team that was there was watching it live. this is that

1181
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,280
Famous image. You'll notice Obama is golfing

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,079
Inside, that is, within 12:30, both of them

1187
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,680
Helicopters reach Osama's compound

1188
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,480
Let's go. This is what you are seeing, this is the

1189
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,880
There is a layout of the entire compound. This is the main gate.

1190
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,800
These people burn garbage etc here

1191
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,280
Were. He had grown vegetables on this side. These

1192
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,760
Before entering the main compound from here, there is a

Osama with his wife and children on the same floor

1199
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,480
I was sleeping with. Now the first Black Hawk

1200
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,200
The helicopter had 12 Navy SEALs in it

1201
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,760
There were commanders. The name of this team was Chowk One and

It was a helicopter, it stayed in the air and

1207
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,480
One of these Navy SEAL officers with a dog

1208
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,119
He gets down and after getting down he goes to this side of the compound

1209
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,200
Goes to the main gate and guards it so that no one

1210
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,960
also comes from outside or someone tries to escape

1211
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,200
so that it could be handled and after that three more

1212
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,119
Navy SEAL officers come down on the road and there

1213
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,680

Towards the main compound where Osama was

1217
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,040
They grow and as they reach the whole compound

1218
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,720
they switch off the lights of the compound so that

1219
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,319
To move all the people inside

1220
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,640
I am having trouble and can't see anything. Balance

1221
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,640
All the other navies involved in this operation

He was wearing glasses and could see clearly.

1224
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,440
Now after this the second helicopter which was

1225
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,599
Starts descending from the side. but he

1226
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,079
In the downward air flow created by itself

1227
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,319
Gets stuck. Because of which settling with

1228
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,240
There is a dynamic phenomenon called power

1229
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,079
Had gone. And the helicopter completed its

1230
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,920
I had lost control. he became unstable

1231
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,480
Was. During the training time, what he did

1232
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,119
The compound was built, its wall was small

1233
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,599
It was of height and had chain link fencing.

1234
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,359
Whereas the height of the original compound was also

1235
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,680
It was huge and was made of concrete.

1236
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,680
then the helicopter blades fit into it and

1237
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,400
The helicopter becomes unstable. But

1238
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,640
Still the pilot used his brain and took the helicopter

1239
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,960
Made him land on the nose. The rest of this

1240
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,119
They were Navy Seals officers, they got out safely

1241
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,640
Let's go. But the tail of the helicopter

1242
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,800
This is the original image of the wall. Now

1243
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,040
The original plan was that this 24th Navy

1244
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,760
These two helicopters are SEAL officers

1245
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,079
I will drop you. after that go a little farther

1246
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,000
Where there was a secret and deserted area

1247
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,680
Both helicopters will wait there and

1248
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,839
When this operation is completed then it

1249
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,319
Both helicopters will return to the compound

1250
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,079
They will take the Navy SEAL officers and quietly leave

1251
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,520
I will go from here and no one will know

1252
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,599
It'll be alright no matter what happened. But as soon as

1253
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,200
Change your plan if the helicopter crashes

1254
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,560
fell and the other helicopter which was

1255
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,800
It stops right there. Because the helicopter

1256
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,040
The whole operation which was because of the crash

1257
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,119
could not be hidden now because the next

1258
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,880
day usa's cradled helicopter when people

1259
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,640
If you had seen, you would have understood what happened here

1260
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,640
Is. What I mean to say is that this crash

1261
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,280
Because now this mission is not a secret

1262
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,119
Was saved. Now the world had to know

1263
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,880
The US has carried out operations here and

1264
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,680
Because of this the other helicopter stops there

1265
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,160
And the drone was watching this whole compound from above

1266
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,000
and snipers who keep watch over the

1267
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,240
They too were taking their respective positions in this

1268
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,280
Looking around the compound

1269
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,520
Are. After this the power of the whole Apata goes off.

1270
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,599
Is. This was also a part of the CIA's plan

1271
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,480
So that there is not much visibility and people

1272
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,560
Don't know much. but one named Shoaib Attar

1273
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,119
The man who was working on the computer.

1274
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,240
At that time he said on his Twitter handle really

1275
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,680
Helicopter hobbing tweeted from virtual

1276
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,560
Over Atabad region at 1 am is a rare event.

1277
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,200
Now after this, this team would enter from this side

1278
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,440
and the gate is opened using C4 explosive

1279
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,920
It breaks it. Then it goes to this side. In this

1280
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,000
Ibrahim and his family and they

1281
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,480
The room was locked from inside and the seal team

1282
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,160
Matthew who was there went near this room. then close

1283
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,000
Ibrahim fired bullets from inside the room.

1284
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,079
I left it. Navy SEALs also fire bullets from here

1285
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,839
and Ibrahim is killed and then when

1286
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,440
If Ibrahim dies then the gate is opened

1287
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,920
Ibrahim's wife leaves because she

1288
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,520
There was a fear that the children might get shot.

1289
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,599
the children who were behind the sacks

1290
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,200
Had kept it hidden. Matthew with his team

1291
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,880
He makes people surrender there itself. to the children

1292
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,960
He stops there too. Then, your team

1293
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,960
then moves towards the main compound and takes out C4

1294
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,640
The second gate was also destroyed using explosives.

1295
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,559
Let's break it. Now when this is towards the main compound

1296
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,559
Let's go there, O'Neill's team

1297
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,800
Head to the Main Compound with Translator

1298
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,800
It was already increasing. Helicopter at this time

1299
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,200
was going round the whole compound and

1300
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,079
Osama's problem was that the upper floor

1301
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,760
There was no window but she could not stand under the window

1302
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,839
He doesn't know anything about what is going on

1303
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,000
I was able to. Now after this from here Navy SEAL

1304
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,240
Whatever it was, it reaches the ground floor.

1305
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,720
Here is Abrar, his wife and three children

1306
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,880
there are and the translator from here was

1307
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,880
I would call out to Abrar in his own language

1308
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,040
and then as soon as Abrar appears Abrar

1309
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,200
These people shoot him. his wife

1310
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,440
also gets a bullet and all the kids and

1311
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,000
All the females in the compound were told this

1312
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,839
They were collecting it and depositing it in one place. Now its

1313
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,079
Later, the Navy SEAL team arrived on the first floor.

1314
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,960
It reaches. Where Osama's son Khalid is

1315
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,359
Was. Osama's son shot indiscriminately with AK-47

1316
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,760
He opened fire but the Navy SEALs killed him as well

1317
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,480
Eliminated and still the whole team

1318
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,480
She was looking for Osama only. Then O'Neil

1319
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,800
On the top floor with my whole team

1320
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,119
Let's go. Now when O'Neill's team is up on the floor

1321
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,040
When it reaches there then in night vision they see a

1322
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,839
The tall man looks like he could be Osama

1323
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,839
Is. Osama's wife Amal who was Osama's

1324
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:54,319
She stands in front of him to save him

1325
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,640
and shortly thereafter Osama

1326
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,480
pushes his wife over the seal team and

1327
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,079
In the beginning, the sealed team was at the back

1328
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,880
She runs away because she suspects that

1329
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,520
I hope Amal isn't wearing that jacket

1330
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,760
yes. But this does not happen. And then when he

1331
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,200
If you check then O'Neil with his team

1332
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,000
Shoots Amal in the knee. and then

1333
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,760
At 1:10, Osama's left eye is on his forehead

1334
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,680
two shots were fired above

1335
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,000
Is. Now from here Osama was dead but

1336
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,559
It is still not confirmed what the seal team was

1337
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,800
I knew that the man who was killed was Osama

1338
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,119
Is it there or not? Navy SEAL Officer Bison Net

1339
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,880
picked up a sheet from the bed and put it over Osama's face

1340
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,880
Cleaned it up as well. Took photo as well and further

1341
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,720
Sent. This went on for about 15 minutes and it

1342
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,720
Keep confirming who the man who was killed is

1343
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,119
Is he Osama or not? They killed Osama

1344
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,440
I also tried to measure the height but the measuring

1345
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:44,000
I had forgotten to bring the tape. after this

1346
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,559
The one who translated was Osama's daughter Sumayyaan

1347
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,880
And asked Mary who is this man? So

1348
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,640
Maryam just tells a lie. She says that

1349
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,559
This is Abdullah bin Mohammed. But

1350
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,800
Sumaya tells the truth that she was

1351
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,280
Father is Osama. and then to double confirm

1352
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,119
For the third daughter who was 11 years old was Saifiya.

1353
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,440
This is also asked. It also says that

1354
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,920
It is Osama. And then Osama's second wife

1355
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,599
When the Khairiya who was there is asked then she too

1356
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,240
It says that the man who was killed was

1357
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,240
It is Osama. And then the Navy sealed it

1358
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,720
The team was confirmed that they

1359
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,040
Osama was killed. and then after that this

1360
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,200
McCraven sitting in Afghanistan

1361
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,400
call using satellite phone

1362
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,720
Jeronmo Ekeah. Geronimo's CIA team

1363
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,280
Osama's nickname was and the meaning of Ekiya

1364
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,800
Enemy Killed in Action. Same Cheese White House

1365
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,440
It is also mentioned in and after this CH47

1366
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,359
Chenuk helicopter which was there as a backup

1367
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,359
He too reaches the compound and

1368
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,920
Soon after this these people reached the compound

1369
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,680
There were women and children too who got this vegetable

1370
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,280
There was an area where people gathered and stood there

1371
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,599
Let's do it. Whatever came from Osama's room

1372
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,400
there were hard drives, there were cell phones, there were papers,

1373
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,359
These people would collect cameras, DVDs, everything.

1374
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,680
Are. And the plane that crashed was sealed

1375
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,359
The team blows it up with a boom. just his tale

1376
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,040
The part that was there remains. when he flew

1377
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,440
This plane would have been moving very fast even then

1378
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,440
There is a voice and Shoaib Attar who has also spoken earlier

1379
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,040
He tweeted about the blast

1380
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,640
I also tweeted as soon as I heard the voice and then

1381
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,200
After this at 2:26 both the helicopters

1382
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,800
They left Pakistan by taking different routes

1383
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,040
so that these people cannot be tracked and

1384
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,280
They had taken samples of Osama's body

1385
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,280
Both were divided separately in the helicopter

1386
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,520
So that if there is any attack or crash on them

1387
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,240
If yes, then at least one sample out of the two is left

1388
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,559
are. To complete the whole operation

1389
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,720
It took 40 minutes. After this these people are Osama's

1390
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,960
They reach Afghanistan with the body.

1391
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,119
DNA test was conducted inside Jalalabad

1392
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,040
Osama's family is sent for

1393
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,119
To match the member's DNA. And

1394
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,960
After removing Osama's clothes etc., his body etc.

1395
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,880
Let's check out 500 euros from her clothes

1396
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,520
see you. And then when it is actually confirmed

1397
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,680
It turns out that it is Osama. So 11:35

1398
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,640
But Obama tells the whole world that

1399
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,559
He conducted the operation in Pakistan

1400
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,240
inside and killed Osama. this speech

1401
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,800
She said this too was already prepared and

1402
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,040
After that these people took Osama's body

1403
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,280
Muslims by putting them in V2 aircraft

1404
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,440
would put them in the Arabian Sea with rituals

1405
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,480
Are. On the other hand, in Pakistan, morning

1406
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,079
It was 3:45 and everything was revealed

1407
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,839
It was there inside Pakistan also. Army etc

1408
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,240
Had reached the compound's location. There

1409
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:08,319
Who were Osama's wife and other children

1410
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,319
They were taken out and put in a curtained bus

1411
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:13,040
He was taken to the hospital and during interrogation

1412
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:15,280
If it happened then the whole scenario would be about their children and their

1413
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,599
The wife told what happened that night and 5

1414
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,839
How he had been staying here for a year.

1415
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,920
When the file that was found from Osama's room

1416
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,599
When the CIA made it public, Osama said in it

1417
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,359
Ask for documentaries etc. related to you

1418
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,760
So which documentary did you see?

1419
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,480
He was out. In that, Osama who is an adult

1420
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,599
I used to look at the content, that was also there. Children's

1421
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,520
There were games, there were journals that would take Al Qaeda forward

1422
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,160
What to do and how to do it

1423
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,800
were also there. So this is how Osama was caught and

1424
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,599
When this operation was over the SEAL team felt very

1425
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,680
Got appreciation. but the whole operation

1426
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,920
The sealed team had done it successfully.

1427
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,040
But these people forgot to bring the measuring tape

1428
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,200
Were. So Obama jokingly sealed it

1429
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,119
A measuring tape was also gifted to the team.

1430
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,599
And then in this way the US established a global market

1431
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,680
Most wanted man sentenced to 10 years

1432
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,160
caught. For my viewers I learned
