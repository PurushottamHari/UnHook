Immediately Osama handed over his wife to the Navy SEALs. threw it in the face and navy seal When he plugged in that hard drive and checked it So it was revealed that Osama used to watch adult content Is.

[music] Osama left Torabora with horses and On mules towards the Pakistan border It entered. My Country More. I decided the Codes on mountains due to reflection in mirror Creating Osama from one mountain to another Started sending messages. Exterior of the Compound Infrared cameras were brought and Osama's body heat was detected Extracted thermal images from. Osama's DNA was shared between both helicopters and under Pakistan's radar They began to fly and secretly surrounded the compound There were listening devices in the trees on the side I had hidden it.

See 11 In September 2001, when the world's dominance was over the US, The biggest attack was happening at the same time It was Osama who carried out this attack. One in the eastern side of Afghanistan It is a mountainous area and it is inside the US As soon as this attack took place, de were US intelligence agencies that included the CIA, The FBI and NSA did this without wasting any time The investigation of this entire attack is underway Would go. The first thing I did was to board the flight All the passengers who were onboard The records of passports and visas I took them out and started checking them and By doing this he took care of even the smallest details found out and then 19 of them They identified those who felt that These could be the hijackers. Now this is the attack It had been done. Whatever plane was inside, There were people, all the stuff, every thing was destroyed It had already happened. and US Intelligence Agencies had to find out every single detail about these 19 The hijackers whose names were revealed were among from which the hijacker was named Mohammed Atta The bag was accidentally dropped, it was a coincidence. his bag Mistakenly causing delay in connecting flight was left at Boston Logan Airport Was. Now without wasting any time The CIA team located this bag and put it there reaches over and opens it and luckily They don't need to work hard it happens because what is inside this bag He was looking for all the details. I had found the same place. Al Qaeda is inside this bag The instructions of the training, Planning, manuals, everything was there. Even that the will of Mohammed Atta who was Even that which was there was found inside it. And these All the details confirmed that behind this Al Qaeda's Osama also has a hand in this. and its Even after this these people do not stop. This is the 19 They were hijackers ever since they came to the US His old calls, emails, bank details Start tracking these transactions as well did. And in searching all these things they Got official confirmation that all this This is an attack, it was not carried out by Al Qaeda. Because The funding that these hijackers were receiving She came from Al Qaeda inside the US. Who He made a wire transfer from his Dubai account. I had done. And all these hijackers were He has served in Afghanistan and Pakistan I trained in the area, now from here it There was an official confirmation that It's the work of Al Qaeda. But this Al Qaeda The name was not new to the US. The CIA In August 2001 itself, the team of A warning was given a month before that Al Qaeda is going to do something like this. In the Past Al Qaeda has also attacked US embassy etc. attacked many times Are. And the US is from Afghanistan He would have made the demand for Al Qaeda and Osama earlier too remained. And the US already has Al Qaeda's There was a network, Osama's details were already there They have it. pretty much all over the US This thing was angry. now when all these things If it is found out then after that on 20 September 2001 to President George W. Bush in a joint Go to the session of Congress and give speech in which he is in front of the whole world They say to Afghanistan that without any First of all, give us Osama as a condition and secondly Inside Afghanistan, these are the al-Qaeda's Training camps are going on, stop it immediately will have to do and if it is not done then the US The military will take action. Now your question It will be certain that Afghanistan will hand over Osama. Why would he mess with such a big super power? Will you take it? But inside Afghanistan, The situation that was going on was also not normal. Civil war has been going on in Afghanistan since 1992 Was. In which it was said that 90% of Afghanistan The area was under Taliban control And the Northern Alliance occupies 10% of the area Was. And the Taliban are already fighting battles Osama was inside Afghanistan had helped the Taliban a lot. From funding to train Taliban fighters till. Osama helped the Taliban a lot And ideologically also Taliban and Al Qaeda Were aligned. So just like that Osama was picked up It is not easy for the Taliban to give to the US Was. Taliban's own situation may also worsen let's go. So as soon as the US made this demand The Taliban attacked the next day, i.e. on 21 September I told him in 2001 that whatever you are saying Give me proof that this attack was carried out by Osama Got it done. then we think about it In. And along with this the Taliban also He said that Osama is our guest. So we will pick up our guest just like this Can't give it. This is against our civilization Is. Look, the US was anything at that time. was not ready to listen and the Taliban As soon as he refused to give it to Osama Just two weeks later, the USA Preparation Key and Operation Enduring Freedom started in Afghanistan In which USA did what in Afghanistan The Northern Alliance was the enemy of the Taliban Together with all the hideouts of the Taliban Destroying them inside Afghanistan Started and started searching for Osama Did. The biggest leaders who were of the Taliban started killing them one by one and The Northern Alliance inside Afghanistan Force which was helping USA with this USA got a lot of advantage due to location etc. To find out and kill them. Now USA was killing Taliban day by day was being defeated and inside Afghanistan Doing big operations one after the other Was. Now from here the situation of Osama was It also started getting worse. Hiding for Osama too It was getting difficult. so what did osama do Did? Osama took his bodyguard with him in Afghanistan this here this Torabora There are hills of. He has come here. Pakistan border is also near it Seems like This hilly area right here Is. So Osama came and sat here. Now After reaching here Osama and his men All the fighters had electronic Use this method to a minimum Gave. Just sometimes when there was a need Through an unsecured radio transmission These people used to communicate. and because Electronic method was not used. So Whatever advanced technology the US had All his methods were failing. Now After this he searches for US for several days and There are three or four such things in front of the US Because of which, they come to know that Osama is in Tora Bora. first thing So what happened was that the US had Al-Qaeda members were caught inside them One of them told me that he had seen the last Joe I saw him looking towards the hills of Torabora I saw him while leaving. Now on the basis of this one clue USA should not go to Tora Bora and attack Could have done. Torabora was a very large area and It was a hilly area. now the second thing after this It happened that a US agency There was a specific team which was working for Al Qaeda unsecured radio signals which were through which people communicate with each other She used to sit and listen to him. so that communication He also mentioned the name of Toraboda in heard and along with it there was a team from USA which is based on Al Qaeda's method of communication I was studying. He had told that Al-Qaeda members are fighting among themselves in the hills I used to communicate so what is this in that used to do that from the reflection of the mirror into the code We used to talk to each other inside the hill. So in the hills of Torabora also this He saw the reflections daily. and then one One day Osama accidentally transmitted the message on an unsecured radio If I talk to Signal somewhere, then it's about Osama Voice was also captured in it. The actual one is Jalal There was a man named who was imitating Osama's voice for 7 years I was studying. So he heard the voice Confirmation given that this was Osama's speech Pattern and Arabic dialect. now as soon as When all these details are collected then its Next Day All Intel US Virginia where the CIA head quarters are It is sent. He has collected all the intelligence collected the data and put it into a Convert to Electronic Battle Field Map Did it. That means, as much as they By observing the intelligence data Made a map of it. and then the same map Using the US Secret Delta Force Which was led by Major Dalton Fury. He took the Northern Alliance with him. Kept 70 soldiers and a CIA team with him and headed towards Torabora to capture Osama Reached for it. Now as soon as the Delta of the US When the force reached the hill of Torabora, 3 of the US from December 2001 to 7 December 2001 Delta Force hits Tora Bora nonstop Dropped £700,000 by the day. but his Even later it was not known that Osama Where is it, after all? Now understand Osama from here I had come to think that he would get stuck here like this And the US Delta Force knows about it that Osama is here. So it comes back like this I will not go. So Osama had an unsecured Through radio transmission, Afghan The Northern Alliance which is based in Torabora, US She had come along with me. with him in this unsecured Started talking through radio signal. He said that he is ready to surrender. But he and his companions came down and surrendered. You will be able to do it only when you people stop dropping bombs will you do it. So that means to say that he is One day ceasefire was declared during the conversation He was demanding that he surrender only then Will get it. Now the CIA team is not sure Was. He and Surety really wanted that Will Osama do this or not? So the one who The radio that Osama and his companions They had conversion through signals and Osama knew that Whatever Osama could do through his fighters He is having a conversation on this radio The US is listening. So he said that radio Whatever we talked about in the conversation was all about this did it in a way that the CIA team Get confirmation that you have really surrendered are going to. And then the CIA guys did Osama's They fall into the trap and on 11 December They tell the Northern Alliance that Osama Talk and get the deal done. and the next day i.e. that on December 12, Osama was surrendered Had to do it. But as many time bombings as stopped During that time Osama prepared his escape route and took his bodyguard to Pakistan fled on horses and mules toward the After this suddenly Osama's family She too would have disappeared inside Afghanistan Is. Now nobody knows where he went Was. This was a huge opportunity that the US had in its hands departed from Was. Now after this Osama is out of the hands of US It had gone out. but in the same week that is On December 19, 2001, an Afghan CIA Mukhtar was the informer. to him again Intelligence comes that Osama's family has reached Pakistan. so the idea from this It was alleged that if his family was from Pakistan If it has reached then Osama is also in Pakistan It must be somewhere. And then the US Together we find Osama in Pakistan Turned it on. And actually this input is correct was also there. Osama is Pakistan's federal Administered Tribal Area (FATA) which was I had gone there. This Pakistan's Osama went to the area because Before 2018, this area was a part of Pakistan. It was a special semi-autonomous region. here Main stream legal system of Pakistan Instead, the tribal governance model was in place. And This here is Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan, The Haqqani Network and Lashkar Jangvi, LeJ which This was a very strong hold of his. who kept Osama here and this After reaching the area, Osama The entire strategy was changed. outside of any kind of contact with the world That was it, it was cut. Even the first one al-Qaeda members and guards who were I used to talk to those who communicate He had cut that too. Anyone Didn't know either. Even Al-Qaeda Even the members did not know that Osama and his Where is the family? osama and his family Whatever they were, they stayed hidden and the outside world Daily need to contact with, All the work of security and logistics Ibrahim Al Kuwaiti used to do it. this is al qaeda and was the trustee of the Radio, Satellite Osama away from phone, internet and everything else Writes daily letters to communicate who used to go to al-Qaeda and he was in that He used to sign his name with a code name Ajammaraye Was. And Ibrahim Osama's work as a courier I used to do it and the messages that were there would go further Al Qaeda had different networks I used to deliver it and from there it was decided that What should Al Qaeda do next? This whole electronic part in the chain of communication It was also not used. just an exception He had done it. if something was urgent So Ibrahim was logged into Gmail for that. I used to do it. I used to write a message in draft And those who were members of Al Qaeda also had Same was the password for Gmail. they log in And then I would open the same draft and read it. But they did not send it to each other. So Now this is how Osama and his family can hide started living there and their communication and other Ibrahim had all the necessities I kept handling it. and then after some time when Osama's work etc. was similar to that of Ibrahim It became difficult to handle alone. So Ibrahim took permission from the leadership of Al Qaeda Osama also took his brother Abar al Kuwaiti with him Got a courier made for Rs. So now give it from here People had become Osama's couriers. that area Ibrahim and Abar were both inside If they lived alone together, people would get suspicious Could have done. So if it feels like a family then this Because of this, both of them were also married. He was married to 14 year old Bushra and Maryam This was done so that all these people could live a normal life Looked like a Pashto family. now here it is Osama was living secretly in this manner. There itself On the other hand, on a daily basis, the US The agencies were trying to find Osama was following the method. The whole of Pakistan Osama's army was in the FATA region Big prizes were announced above That even the smallest details are taken care of. if any If he tells, he will get a reward. and this thing every If it reaches someone, then the shops which Matchboxes were available with prize printed on them too It was done that whatever was said about Osama Anyone who tells anything will get $5 million. Along with this, the CI has also inspected the entire area. There are some private mobile companies like AT&T, Sprint, Variy with one A secret agreement was also signed. In which whatever is in the entire FATA area Shops selling mobile phones and computers They put a secret chip in it and started selling it Were. So that when Al Qaeda people buy that phone So, they should be tracked. because such And no other clue was found. but this The whole thing failed because Osama completely switched to electronic mode It was kept closed. Now year after year goes by and there was a lot of pressure on the CIA team There was pressure and they were getting frustrated Were. So now after some time what will the CIA do? does it? She tries to make sure that she has someone of her own The guy is thinking of planting her in Al-Qaeda Because he realised it only then Something will be found out about Osama. So Humam al-Balawi alias Abu Dujana was a doctor by the name of Al Qaeda He was caught because of his links with . So The CIA catches him and says that you are our Become a double agent. You just know that to find out where Osama is and further Your whole life is free will go. You won't go to any jail. and then If he says yes to this thing then it is a After getting some training and then News is spread that Balawi is Has escaped from the hands of the CIA. Now from here Its job was to win the trust of Al Qaeda. Does the CIA know anything about Osama? If you want to go, tell the CIA. Balawi who was Did exactly as the CIA said. It won the trust of al-Qaeda and small Started giving input. and then some of it Later it told the CIA that al-Qaeda He needed a doctor like that. To them its There is a lot of trust above. of al-Qaeda to treat the mastermind Al Jawahari The task was given to him. all these medical also sends reports etc. and the CIA She becomes very happy. and then its A few days later it was sent to the CIA by a secured Tells through the network that it was Osama Know very important thing about It has gone away. So the CIA could catch Osama will take it. and then it says I'll give you I will tell you the details. You please set me free. But he did not tell me all these details over the phone. I can tell you only after meeting you. The CIA This was kept in Chapman's most secured camp She calls me secretly. Same Week Balawi's It was also a birthday. So the CIA team is so happy That he had made a surprise cake for Balawi It was also kept that as soon as he came, he would get information about Osama I will tell you then everyone will come together and make a cake and all the CIA personnel inside this camp Only senior officers used to live there. Now from here Balawi who was there comes. of the whole camp The security around was very tight Was. Everyone is being checked at the first check post Was. But the CIA ordered Balawi to be checked. was refused. at the second check post too There was no checking of this. said it straight I said let him come forward. Now all the CIA caught the security guards and escaped freely reaches the camp of. where the CIA's The top leadership was waiting for him today Osama's location will be revealed. and Balawi Meets with all the CIA officers. He extends both hands and blows himself up gives Is. Balawi was their double agent. It was not made. He had made a plan with Al Qaeda On the contrary, all the officers in this camp were A plan was made to kill him. this a Seven CIA officers were killed in the blast and a total of 16 People were killed. in the history of the CIA This had never happened before. and osama's location Because of this whole plan, let alone meeting If the entire leadership of the CIA was blown away then this After the incident, the effort to find Osama began. There was a process, that too had slowed down. Now After this, new leadership of CIA came. Osama's health was also very good It was down. So the Al Qaeda people are Osama's I was looking for a secure place for myself. and beans On time they were sent to Aabad, Pakistan Pay for a plot near the Military Academy The sale board is visible written. Them It seemed that it was Pakistan's cantonment area It is nearby. If Osama stays here then No one will suspect. So immediately after that Abrar is sent and Abrar withdraws $50 cash With Leke and Fake ID it's $38000 I bought this plot of square feet Takes it. immediately after that the local Architect Mohammed Younis was hired He started building more houses and The house was ready within a year i.e. by 2006. and in 2006 Osama, Abrar, The family of all three Ibrahim shifted here It happens. All work outside the home Sending letters etc. to Al Qaeda, communication Maintenance etc and further planning to do. Abar and Ibrahim used to do the courier Banke and inside the house of Abar and Ibrahim The wife used to cook food etc. and she used to do all the other work and Osama was He remained hidden inside this compound all the time Was. Now Osama had shifted here and The US will not be given any information about his location for the next 5 years. I cannot tell. Now after this comes the date 27th of August 2010 and on this day the CIA I had no idea that for so many years He is working day and night to find her Today he is going to meet them by deceit. What happens is that Osama's most trusted The courier whose name was Ibrahim was called I had to go to Peshawar city for some work and already inside the whole Peshawar city which There were signals, they were on the CIA's radar. Now General Ibrahim talks in areas like Peshawar uses a secure method to do so Was. But that day, due to laziness, he went to Peshawar Standing in a public area of ​​your Some information was received from Al-Qaeda members through personal phone He talks for seconds. Now Ibrahim made this phone call Because of this the CIA immediately arrested Ibrahim's live Tracks the location and where you are standing Ibrahim made a call from there reaches, and after reaching Tri does not catch Ibrahim but that by following Ibrahim he should go further The locations can also be traced Could. Now after this Ibrahim is back with his white Suzuki Potaur Gp with Rear Spare There was a Renault built on the tyre, I was sitting in it He starts walking and from here the CIA agents Those who were there started chasing it Are. For a long time, the CIA was Ibrahim chases the car and then runs away for a while After some time Ibrahim came to his car There is a Bilal Town in Apata. takes a turn and goes a little further There was a very big compound there after that Ibrahim enters inside with his jeep. Now the CI team that was standing outside stopped Let's start discussing that What to do next? Mainly these people are thinking instead of going in directly, I was waiting for a few days This compound should be tracked till Where did Ibrahim go after leaving from here and with his help it may reach Osama Can reach. Now when these CIA people are talking to each other While they were discussing, their attention was on Ibrahim fell on the compound he had entered and that When he looked at the compound carefully, That compound seemed a bit strange to him. It is completed in about 38,000 square feet A compound was made. But such a large compound There was only one main entry and the walls Which was its 18 feet high boundary had been made all around and around those boundaries Barb wire was also installed on top and the upper These people seeing the floor and more I was surprised. there were no windows and There was a balcony and a 7 feet boundary was made in it Had kept it. Generally if you look at the balcony then There is no such high boundary in it He gets it done. So after seeing all these things, There is a doubt that this much is for Ibrahim All the arrangements might not have been made. Sure There is no high value in this with Ibrahim There could be a target that can lead to Osama. Because these people were sure that Osama will not be in this compound. Because There, at some distance, the Pakistani military There was also an academy. Osama is not that big a risk will take that near pakistan military academy He built a house and started living there. They thought that This is somewhere in a cave or somewhere in the mountains It will happen in. now the next day again this These people reach near the compound. These People can also do activities that take place inside the compound. Let us start observing them. And when more details about this compound If you find out, you will be even more surprised These people go away. They found out that in the past 5 People who have been living inside this compound for years the houses that are around, the people that are He did not have any dealings with anyone. And At that time, there were no wired phone lines inside homes. It used to happen. So there is no phone inside this compound There was no line. Internet, technology These people were not using any such thing. These It was completely a military area. even then here There is no surveillance camera or anything else. It was engaged in this area and the people around And he said something indirectly to the children When they tried to find out things, these people He told that he is very rich. One The ball went off while the kids were playing cricket I went inside the compound. So he played the ball did not return but won in his place I gave them 10 times the price of the ball. Now CIA agents took all these details The director who was there at that time Punita writes this email to him. that email The title was Closing in on Osama Belades Courier. Mainly in this entire email he It was written that this compound is normal Not there. We have a feeling this could also be the case There must be Osama inside it. now when this email Leon Panetta gets that one right away Create a presentation and After making the constitution, this happened directly to President Barack Obama. They reach out to Obama and see one like this The compound has been found inside Pakistan Is. The team believes that Osama is inside it It may be possible and for this we need to Tell Pakistan a list of the entire compound Investigation will have to be started. So this But Obama says that even though this compound It is inside Pakistan. Pakistan without you Tell him something and start your work. Now As soon as we get the go ahead from the White House It was just the beginning of September 2010. these people Efforts were made to find out about this compound Let's go. And all these people together A common document was prepared which was named Anatomy of a Lead. The details which are there in this It was found related to the compound, in this People used to add it. no matter how small it is Why not? Now when these people get this compound They were tracking and in the meanwhile they got to know about it It happens that in between, in this compound which Women live by using a phone Sometimes we talk and to talk about that During this time she lies that she is in Kuwait Are. While this was the same person from APTA of Pakistan Inside the compound. these basics for many days Information which is from far away from this compound and November In 2010, the CIA team that was working for the US She was sitting inside and she reaches Obama that there were many chances of Osama being in this compound There are strong chances. We must have this Some action should be taken on the compound. There are very high chances that Osama You will find it inside. Now Obama, all these details After listening to this they ask you, How strong a feeling are you saying? It is strong. You tell me in percentage. So John said at that time that 90% of his team said 80% and the deputy director of the CIA Michael Morell said 60% and then after that Obama said that this compound is It is inside Pakistan. if we take any action If you want to do it then there are some more possibilities Will have to explore. This can also happen that instead of Osama some Gulf Sheikh would run away living there or it could be someone else Is. And even by mistake we took some action and If someone else takes Osama's place, we can afford it Can't do it. Very bad reputation And relations with Pakistan will also deteriorate Will be. Now from here the CIA analyst The team understood that and details need to be collected if this compound Some action has to be done above. It seems to them that thought that Osama was inside it but they Proof was needed and for that these people decided Let's say this compound in Apatabad Some observation posts will have to be built near it And any local guy who is trustworthy will also have to be included. Otherwise, this compound The details are not available correctly I will get it. So the CIA team that was in his past The relation was that of a retired Pakistani Lieutenant Colonel Syed was an army officer Iqbal's past relation with the CIA team They were very good. He served as lieutenant Colonel Said Iqbal was given the responsibility of the entire compound. and said that secretly in this They need help with this. Now this lieutenant Colonel Syed Iqbal was a friend of Dr Aamir Aziz whose house is this compound he was just 80 yards away from him And from its roof, there are many doors inside the compound. Locations were visible. So the CIA team This retired Lieutenant Colonel Syed Iqbal decided to send Aamir home and then Syed Iqbal reached Aamir's house shortly after So he talks about this and that. then he says I'd like to meet your dog. The dogs that were actually inside Aamir's house He was on the roof. And on the pretext of meeting these dogs Retired Lieutenant Colonel Syed Iqbal Chhat and from the top of the same roof it I took multiple photos of the compound He takes the photo and gives it to the CIA. He brings it and gives it to me. Related to this compound Added all the details that were available was going and its task was to had a separate team which was led by Gina Bennett doing Was. This team was responsible for this whole Making an actual layout of the compound. as much as Small details are being collected By doing this and then in the same week he There is also an office 1 mile away from the compound Took this office on rent and turned it into a CIA camp Made it. All the meetings that took place She used to be in this same office which was the CIA's He used to act like a camp. this whole area When I reached the compound where it was When these CIA analysts used to go, the voice At that time, in order to not let it get too much, he I used to drive a Lexis coach car, I took it And these people used to sit in it and go and inspect He used to do it for the whole area. The CIA analyst that the whole team was in this for even a second Keep the entire compound away from your monitoring I didn’t do it. to track down this compound For this he used infrared camera and night vision. Vision cameras were installed to protect against human heat thermal images can be collected and night Track all movements at night with vision camera and make a report. To them One thing was known that whatever these there are people, what time do they eat, what time Do you sleep and at what time do you come to visit? All the popular trees around the compound There were, listing devices were installed in all of them so that if anything happens by mistake then Let it be heard. Now and then December 2010 it had started and till now they Whatever details were collected. from that They had come to know so much that this compound 20 to 22 people live inside. in which They thought that it was Osama and Osama has three wives and children Iqbal and Abar who Yes, his family is living inside it. And Along with this, they also found out that Every day a man is taken out from inside this compound sends written notes which Ibrahim as a becomes a courier and delivers it forward and in this way All the fighters in the entire Al Qaeda etc., they used to get the message and then further The planning was decided. The CIA team I was very sure that this type of Osama himself sent the message from inside the compound can send it but they have no proof It was not there. The CIA team is there day and night, just that one I was trying to find the proof, after which It can be sent to USA and then this compound Some action plan should be made against Osama should be caught. now after that in december By last week, the CIA team She was monitoring on daily basis Noticed some activity on . of this compound The top floor inside has a The tall man comes to the balcony and walks briskly does it for a while and then goes inside He goes to the balcony and puts up shades etc. Such arrangements were made that the long The man's face was not visible. just the wall The shadow of that man was visible above and Osama's His height was also 6 feet 4 inches. So CI team just on the basis of that shadow the wall and the shadow that was there Prepared a report by calculating the ratio. But The exact height is not mentioned in that report either Pie. A range came. it came in that report The height of the man who walks is 5 foot 5 It can range from 8 inches to 6 feet 8 inches. So this range turns out to be very long, so this Also they are unable to reach any conclusion. But the entire CIA team was on a conclusion. had reached that this tall man who is in this He comes to the compound every day and roams around in the balcony Is. He is the head of this entire compound. because there was this one man in that 20 to 25 among the people who were working around I never helped them. So from this The CIA team had found out that this Main is a man and he could be Osama also Who is living on the top floor. Now after this The CIA team decides among themselves that if by digging inside the ground, this If access to the compound's sewage is obtained DNA will be found from human waste and then There will be assurance that Osama is in this compound Is it inside or not. who was osama's father He married 22 times and had 56 brothers She was a sister. So the CIA team already has it It was the DNA of Osama's family. And This was the plan to reach the sewage These people also extend it for several days. and then At last they reach this conclusion that there is so much digging inside the ground and If there is a movement then the people inside the compound they will get suspicious and stay for 10 years After all this was the only chance to catch Osama I have got it but I am afraid it might slip out of my hands. So They drop this plan but After this the CIA team does something new. What happens is that inside Pakistan there is a There was a local doctor whose name was Shakeel Afridi. Now this doctor has a secret of the CIA The operative was Kate. go to them and says it is a program called Save the Child She runs an NGO in which all the poor there are children, they are helped and then they The doctor puts a proposal in front of Afridi is that apt is here to give money to kids hepatitis B due to deficiency of The vaccine is not being administered and Their NGO is for the poor of this area. hepatitis B vaccine for children Wants to run a vaccination campaign. Actually the CIA's plan was that This compound is being used under the pretext of vaccination Will go inside. Their children are being harassed under the same pretext The DNA will be found and it will reveal that Is Osama inside or not? in the beginning so Doctor Afridi is so interesting do not show it. But this is what the C.I.A. The secret operative was getting this from his colleague She introduces him to Doctor Afridi. Tell more what do you do? Doctor Afridi's Personal in the account transfers $55,000 Are. Now after getting the money Afridi is without Use your mind on vaccination work Let's start it. Afridi absolutely I had no idea that she was going to spend the most You are going to make a big mistake. Afridi has Without thinking anything there was a Job nearby There was a medical college. From there nurses and health Care workers recruited and new In the area from to Bilal Town Vaccination drive has started. Everywhere I put up posters saying it's very good Quality Mson vaccine will be administered this Children inside the area. now for the vaccine The drive starts and Dr Afridi Near the same compound with his team The CA people wait for them eagerly been doing this for days and after reaching He plays the bell like Doctor Afridi etc. Ibrahim comes out and chases them all away. Gives. This is what Sue and Kate say People try many times from phone also By taking out the number from here and there but there It also does not work out and this thing about the CIA The plan that was there also fails. Now the doctor Afridi drove because of money did but they did not know that it What was USA making them do behind this and Due to a mistake Dr Afridi got 33 runs Was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. Even today this jail There is a name of betrayal against Pakistan Pay. Now after this plan fails the CIA She starts exploring other things So that more details can be obtained. on the other side A different story is going on inside this compound. Was being. Inside the compound, Ibrahim and Abrar, this person has been there for the past several years Daily inside this compound, hiding I was tired while doing the activity. Their My health had deteriorated a lot. to ibrahim I had cancer and had become very weak Ibrahim. And now the thing was that he was depressed Medicines were being used and this vaccine guy The incident happened a few days after that Ibrahim and Abar were with Osama we go and tell them that we are like this I am tired of running around and now I am stuck in this compound He won't be able to stay here. So Osama is talking about this He understands and says that this year The attack we carried out on 11th of September 2011 It's its 10th anniversary in USA. So wait till this date and after that You guys can buy a retirement house in Jedda. Lena and I will also leave from here and go to this Will sell the compound. So it means to say that now only a few months were left for Osama to die to leave the compound and the C.I.A. If he had delayed any longer, Osama might have been killed again They do not get it for many years. And this which The CIA was also aware of this It was realised that for a long time If you wait then Osama will leave from here Will go. So till this particular time one more thing It happened that whatever details were available using all of that and satellite images etc. which was by using other technologies CIA analyst Gina Bennett who was He prepared the layout of the whole compound. Had you figured out which thing is where? Where are the stairs? how many of that Are there steps? Where is the car parked? every What is the height of the wall from the angle? it All things were mentioned in this document. And he named this document Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSC) and All the people living inside the compound Every member of Osama, Ibrahim, Abrar He had made a card. this is his This is the original copy. You can see it in this Which floor are you living on? his height How much is it? Every detail is mentioned. and this After completion of the document, Gina who was 100% sure that Osama was this It is inside the compound. and the rest of the team too wanted that now action should take place inside this compound Should be. Otherwise for the last 10 years, They are after Osama again It will go out of their hands. now its next day Top CIA analyst Leon Panetta, Admiral McRaven, Mike Mullan, James Cartridge and Pentagon's counter-terrorism adviser Michael Vickers in the Situation Room of the White House arrives and has a meeting with Obama Are. Even before this meeting he had Help of Geospatial Intelligence Agencies I made a model of the entire compound from it. In which each thing is mentioned floor by floor Was. Like it was actually in the compound. And All these people got together in this meeting Let me confirm that we need to take action now. And Obama too agreed to this. They do it. This whole team that was Obama The first option it puts before us is that we By air in Pakistan's airspace We will enter and spread B2 over this entire compound We will strike with a bomber. as big as This is a compound, total 24 bombs will be used and any US commandos also risk their lives Will not done. But this option that they He told me that there are problems in this that there is a big destruction in this whole area This will happen due to which the lives of the civilians will also be saved. May go. A small earthquake nearby It can also come and this is also a possibility It is possible that we may never know that Osama Was he there or not? because of the DNA There are chances that the evidence will also be destroyed In this. And the biggest problem with this was that Reputation will be damaged worldwide. Relations with Pakistan will deteriorate and we to strike at another country It will be very difficult to defend what is And if any civilian dies by mistake then The problems will become bigger. second option He said that precise drone attack Can be done. But even in this they Explained the problem. This is an option that Osama's chances of escaping from there It's too much and the US is not going to do anything this time Didn't want to miss the opportunity. For 10 years he Was waiting for this thing. a discussion this It also happened that together with Pakistan, Butterl The operation can be done. But Obama has It was clearly refused that under any circumstances I should not let Pakistan know that What are we going to do? and then its Afterwards, this whole discussion took place. So the admiral Mac Raven said the best option was It would happen that without our special team Inform Pakistan about this compound Go inside and identify Osama from the front By doing this, kill yourself and do something to anyone around you. I won't be able to find out. Quietly Special Forces I will go, do my work and come back after doing it Will go. And that was a good thing about this option. that in case Osama is not in the compound If found then it will be very easy to suppress this matter. The only negative thing in this option was that as many The officers will also risk their lives will remain. Now after hearing all these details Obama thinks for a while and then The world's most risky operation in which Navy SEAL officer did this without informing Pakistan I will go to the compound and kill Osama myself. Let us give go ahead for this operation. And This operation was named Operation Neptune Spare. Neptune was kept spare because The Navy Seals team had to go for this operation and Neptune names their sea used to represent heritage and meant spare There is a spear which is precise and effective It is a symbol of attack. so now from here it So it was decided that in this compound Have to take action. but not much time could have been used for preparation Because Osama could have run away and the Admiral McCraven, who was there, introduced Obama I had given the assurance that somehow I would be able to get three He will do all the preparations in a week and As soon as this meeting is over Everyone is in preparation from the next day itself It starts happening. The best officer in the US were needed and then after multiple discussions Navy SEAL Team Six's Red Squadron They were selected for this operation do. The best part of this whole operation The helicopter was a very important part He remained at low height to escape from Pakistan's radar To handle and carry it. For this US Army's 160th Special Operations Division The pilots of the regiment were taken away. it's like this are considered best for such situations. So in this way total 24 officers were selected who were best for this situation and their The previous record was also very good and this All the people who were selected, they had to face some trouble No information was given about this operation either It was said that he was selected to kill Osama Has happened. They were simply told that One in the area of ​​Afghanistan and Pakistan An operation has to be done and preparation for it Have to do it. And then all these things happen After 10th of April 2011 whatever these The officers who were selected were They were found in a forest in North Carolina is taken to a secret location and when When all the officers reached there then their There was a compound in front of Apta The model was kept and a little distance away from there Prepared a compound of the exact same size I had gone there so that all these people could prepare so that and after this inside this very compound that it was an exact replica of the original Doing all these compound team practices starts and during practice time In the same year, he included a Belgian in his team. A dog of the breed named Cairo was also I added this and this dog also got this daily dose of my practice jumping from a helicopter together used to do it and post inside this group A translator was also kept so that the operation could be carried out at the time when these people were being taken out of the compound you must be taking them out, you must be catching them so that We can talk to them and get the details from them So that he can go and then for the next 5 days he remains in the same condition. Practicing floor by floor on the model and flying the plane at low altitude, This unloading is done on daily basis. and then After 5 days i.e. on 18th of April 2011 This whole team was trained by a team from Nevada in the US. Taking me to a secret location on the same model Practice is done. Because Nevada and the temperature and elevation of Afghanistan which It was almost the same. So on the one hand these People were being trained. The other one Other teams were also formed and they too Being prepared for different situations Was. Like if Osama surrendered According to the rule it was that he should not be killed Can. He will have to be arrested. So a team was created in which lawyers interpreters etc. so that after arresting them, they could be handed over to that team So that Osama could be brought. and this interrogation USS in the Arabian Sea, preparing the team Carl Vinson Aircraft Carrier Pay Practice was being done and got prepared It was being said that in case Osama surrendered If he gives it then he will be brought on this aircraft will go and this specific team will Will do interrogation. then another team which was created by Rodes and George Littlehead Was doing. The work of this team was to What to say to the media after the operation? These people are preparing for different scenarios Was doing. Like if Osama is killed Then what do you have to say to the media? surrenders Then what should I say? If Navy SEALs get caught or the operation fails. That What briefing is to be given to the media in the case? This team gave information to the media for every situation What to say, how to say it, All things were ready. and its With Mark Kelton and Ambassador Cameron Those who were there also had their two plans ready And I submitted it. this was in the plan That if the Navy SEALs get stuck somewhere during the operation If so, how can you escape? In this he has two Having prepared the plan, we headed towards the Indian border An exit route was made from. The second one is from Karachi He had made an exit plan from his side. Where he served on the USS Carl Vincent Ship was already posted there. So this After getting all the things ready, the rough work that The plan that he had made was this that this whole team is first from USA Afghanistan after taking training etc. There is a US airbase in Jalalabad I will go and stop there and wait for the orders will do it. And in Jalalabad airbase total Five helicopters Two UA 60 Black Hawk Stealth helicopters and three Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters will wait for them. And When they get go ahead then these people Helicopters can be used in Pakistan's airspace By flying at low height to intercept Pakistan's radar We will reach the location by escaping from there. this which These were helicopters, they were special. To them It was also customized. The heat of these The signatures were very low. sound very low Was. It was very difficult to catch them. They had decided that the people of Jalalabad In the air space where there are five helicopters Will be. One of them is a CH4-47 Chinook The helicopter is waiting at the airbase This will be done so that there is a need for backup of fuel etc. So it was useful. The remaining two CH-47 Chinook Those helicopters were from Khyber, Pakistan The hills of Pashtun Kala Dhaka Sweat we will stay in the area that Osama It was 50 miles away from the compound. This was also kept as a backup, inside which There was a quick reaction team of 24 officers so that If heavy retaliation comes from the compound then it people should also reach near the compound and the rest which two US 60 Black Hawk Stealth There were helicopters, their main job was Osama to go to the compound and complete the operation to do. Along with this RQ 170 Sentinel The stealth drone was there to cover the entire compound He will be there and monitor everything. So He had set this plan and on S Plan 26th of April 2011 Whole Team Previously in Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan It reaches. rests here for a day And next day i.e. on 27th of April At Jalalabad Airbase in Afghanistan The entire team reached there to complete the operation. She starts waiting for orders. Now its Next day i.e. on 28th of April 2011 Obama holds meetings and in the morning Final approval of the entire operation at 8:20 I sign it and as soon as it is signed it becomes 38th Fix the date of off April 2011 is given for this operation. but like The date is fixed at the same time, the weather that the reports that come in start to turn out bad Is. On this day fog is more visible. So Because of this these people have now changed the date Historical date fix for First of May 2011 Let's do it. Now only one day is left after this It was to capture Osama. and then its After all the preparations are done finally That historic day of First of May 2011 arrived The day when the world's most A risky operation is about to take place. US Intelligence US Special Unit. The time zones of the US and Afghanistan were different. So there was a difference in their time. In the US The time was 1:22 Eastern Time And in Afghanistan it's 11:00 p.m. were supposed. and it is made at this specific time And McRaven would have started this operation Are. Around 2:00 according to USA time At this time Obama was playing golf. came and sat in the Situation Room of the White House go and start updating everything Let's do it. and on the other side It was 11:30 pm in Afghanistan. And Osama, after having dinner at night, went to his On the upper floor with wife and kids He goes to sleep. absolutely to osama I had no idea that in the next few hours What is going to happen to them? Now after this Jalalabad airbase in Afghanistan It was where the team was waiting for so long. So plan on S one of the five helicopters The helicopter was a CH4-47 Chinook helicopter He stops there as a backup. the rest of The four helicopters were two Chinooks and two Black Hawks. This is Pakistan which escapes the radar start flying towards swat valley We give it. and within 15 minutes entering Pakistan's airspace We give it. And as soon as the entry is made would start flying at a very low height Are. And they had Pakistan's radar. Can't catch it. Now, after this, these four Helicopter reached Swad Valley around 12:00 they reach there and here two out of four Chinook which carried the Quick Reaction Team Whereas Pakistan's Kala Dhaka tastes Let's stop and wait in the hills. as a Backup. Commander Admiral William McRaven Sitting in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, White of each and every item in the Situation Room of the House Was giving an update. and the officers and the drones that There were cameras installed in it. So the camera's Because inside the situation room, Obama and his The team that was there was watching it live. this is that Famous image. You'll notice Obama is golfing I am sitting here wearing clothes. Now after this Two Black Hawks over Swett Valley at night Helicopters Operation Osama's Compound we head out to do it and walk for 30 minutes Inside, that is, within 12:30, both of them Helicopters reach Osama's compound Let's go. This is what you are seeing, this is the There is a layout of the entire compound. This is the main gate. These people burn garbage etc here Were. He had grown vegetables on this side. These Before entering the main compound from here, there is a There is a room. Here Ibrahim and his The family was sleeping. and here this is the main There was a compound, with arbours on its ground floor And his family was sleeping. first floor On it was Osama's son Khalid and above it Osama with his wife and children on the same floor I was sleeping with. Now the first Black Hawk The helicopter had 12 Navy SEALs in it There were commanders. The name of this team was Chowk One and the second Black Hawk helicopter that was in There were also 12 Navy SEALs. with them a dog and There was also a translator. The name of their team was Chowk two. Now after this the Chowk Two one It was a helicopter, it stayed in the air and One of these Navy SEAL officers with a dog He gets down and after getting down he goes to this side of the compound Goes to the main gate and guards it so that no one also comes from outside or someone tries to escape so that it could be handled and after that three more Navy SEAL officers come down on the road and there They get down on the road and start waiting, and then After this, the rest of the Navy SEAL officers were also Get down and jump from the side wall of the road Towards the main compound where Osama was They grow and as they reach the whole compound they switch off the lights of the compound so that To move all the people inside I am having trouble and can't see anything. Balance All the other navies involved in this operation He was a SEALs officer in the Night Region He was wearing glasses and could see clearly. Now after this the second helicopter which was Starts descending from the side. but he In the downward air flow created by itself Gets stuck. Because of which settling with There is a dynamic phenomenon called power Had gone. And the helicopter completed its I had lost control. he became unstable Was. During the training time, what he did The compound was built, its wall was small It was of height and had chain link fencing. Whereas the height of the original compound was also It was huge and was made of concrete. then the helicopter blades fit into it and The helicopter becomes unstable. But Still the pilot used his brain and took the helicopter Made him land on the nose. The rest of this They were Navy Seals officers, they got out safely Let's go. But the tail of the helicopter This is the original image of the wall. Now The original plan was that this 24th Navy These two helicopters are SEAL officers I will drop you. after that go a little farther Where there was a secret and deserted area Both helicopters will wait there and When this operation is completed then it Both helicopters will return to the compound They will take the Navy SEAL officers and quietly leave I will go from here and no one will know It'll be alright no matter what happened. But as soon as Change your plan if the helicopter crashes fell and the other helicopter which was It stops right there. Because the helicopter The whole operation which was because of the crash could not be hidden now because the next day usa's cradled helicopter when people If you had seen, you would have understood what happened here Is. What I mean to say is that this crash Because now this mission is not a secret Was saved. Now the world had to know The US has carried out operations here and Because of this the other helicopter stops there And the drone was watching this whole compound from above and snipers who keep watch over the They too were taking their respective positions in this Looking around the compound Are. After this the power of the whole Apata goes off. Is. This was also a part of the CIA's plan So that there is not much visibility and people Don't know much. but one named Shoaib Attar The man who was working on the computer. At that time he said on his Twitter handle really Helicopter hobbing tweeted from virtual Over Atabad region at 1 am is a rare event. Now after this, this team would enter from this side and the gate is opened using C4 explosive It breaks it. Then it goes to this side. In this Ibrahim and his family and they The room was locked from inside and the seal team Matthew who was there went near this room. then close Ibrahim fired bullets from inside the room. I left it. Navy SEALs also fire bullets from here and Ibrahim is killed and then when If Ibrahim dies then the gate is opened Ibrahim's wife leaves because she There was a fear that the children might get shot. the children who were behind the sacks Had kept it hidden. Matthew with his team He makes people surrender there itself. to the children He stops there too. Then, your team then moves towards the main compound and takes out C4 The second gate was also destroyed using explosives. Let's break it. Now when this is towards the main compound Let's go there, O'Neill's team Head to the Main Compound with Translator It was already increasing. Helicopter at this time was going round the whole compound and Osama's problem was that the upper floor There was no window but she could not stand under the window He doesn't know anything about what is going on I was able to. Now after this from here Navy SEAL Whatever it was, it reaches the ground floor. Here is Abrar, his wife and three children there are and the translator from here was I would call out to Abrar in his own language and then as soon as Abrar appears Abrar These people shoot him. his wife also gets a bullet and all the kids and All the females in the compound were told this They were collecting it and depositing it in one place. Now its Later, the Navy SEAL team arrived on the first floor. It reaches. Where Osama's son Khalid is Was. Osama's son shot indiscriminately with AK-47 He opened fire but the Navy SEALs killed him as well Eliminated and still the whole team She was looking for Osama only. Then O'Neil On the top floor with my whole team Let's go. Now when O'Neill's team is up on the floor When it reaches there then in night vision they see a The tall man looks like he could be Osama Is. Osama's wife Amal who was Osama's She stands in front of him to save him and shortly thereafter Osama pushes his wife over the seal team and In the beginning, the sealed team was at the back She runs away because she suspects that I hope Amal isn't wearing that jacket yes. But this does not happen. And then when he If you check then O'Neil with his team Shoots Amal in the knee. and then At 1:10, Osama's left eye is on his forehead two shots were fired above Is. Now from here Osama was dead but It is still not confirmed what the seal team was I knew that the man who was killed was Osama Is it there or not? Navy SEAL Officer Bison Net picked up a sheet from the bed and put it over Osama's face Cleaned it up as well. Took photo as well and further Sent. This went on for about 15 minutes and it Keep confirming who the man who was killed is Is he Osama or not? They killed Osama I also tried to measure the height but the measuring I had forgotten to bring the tape. after this The one who translated was Osama's daughter Sumayyaan And asked Mary who is this man? So Maryam just tells a lie. She says that This is Abdullah bin Mohammed. But Sumaya tells the truth that she was Father is Osama. and then to double confirm For the third daughter who was 11 years old was Saifiya. This is also asked. It also says that It is Osama. And then Osama's second wife When the Khairiya who was there is asked then she too It says that the man who was killed was It is Osama. And then the Navy sealed it The team was confirmed that they Osama was killed. and then after that this McCraven sitting in Afghanistan call using satellite phone Jeronmo Ekeah. Geronimo's CIA team Osama's nickname was and the meaning of Ekiya Enemy Killed in Action. Same Cheese White House It is also mentioned in and after this CH47 Chenuk helicopter which was there as a backup He too reaches the compound and Soon after this these people reached the compound There were women and children too who got this vegetable There was an area where people gathered and stood there Let's do it. Whatever came from Osama's room there were hard drives, there were cell phones, there were papers, These people would collect cameras, DVDs, everything. Are. And the plane that crashed was sealed The team blows it up with a boom. just his tale The part that was there remains. when he flew This plane would have been moving very fast even then There is a voice and Shoaib Attar who has also spoken earlier He tweeted about the blast I also tweeted as soon as I heard the voice and then After this at 2:26 both the helicopters They left Pakistan by taking different routes so that these people cannot be tracked and They had taken samples of Osama's body Both were divided separately in the helicopter So that if there is any attack or crash on them If yes, then at least one sample out of the two is left are. To complete the whole operation It took 40 minutes. After this these people are Osama's They reach Afghanistan with the body. DNA test was conducted inside Jalalabad Osama's family is sent for To match the member's DNA. And After removing Osama's clothes etc., his body etc. Let's check out 500 euros from her clothes see you. And then when it is actually confirmed It turns out that it is Osama. So 11:35 But Obama tells the whole world that He conducted the operation in Pakistan inside and killed Osama. this speech She said this too was already prepared and After that these people took Osama's body Muslims by putting them in V2 aircraft would put them in the Arabian Sea with rituals Are. On the other hand, in Pakistan, morning It was 3:45 and everything was revealed It was there inside Pakistan also. Army etc Had reached the compound's location. There Who were Osama's wife and other children They were taken out and put in a curtained bus He was taken to the hospital and during interrogation If it happened then the whole scenario would be about their children and their The wife told what happened that night and 5 How he had been staying here for a year. When the file that was found from Osama's room When the CIA made it public, Osama said in it Ask for documentaries etc. related to you So which documentary did you see? He was out. In that, Osama who is an adult I used to look at the content, that was also there. Children's There were games, there were journals that would take Al Qaeda forward What to do and how to do it were also there. So this is how Osama was caught and When this operation was over the SEAL team felt very Got appreciation. but the whole operation The sealed team had done it successfully. But these people forgot to bring the measuring tape Were. So Obama jokingly sealed it A measuring tape was also gifted to the team. And then in this way the US established a global market Most wanted man sentenced to 10 years caught.
