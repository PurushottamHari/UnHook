00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,400
Hi.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,400
[Music]

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:19,909
[Music]

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,920
The S stands for

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,760
stronger, smarter, and subscribe, which

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
is incredible because you guys just got

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
20 million subscribers onto this

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,160
channel. So, that's amazing. Thank you.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,040
No, but it it stands for small. Small

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,440
phones died with the Xen Phone 10, the

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,239
legend. That was the last under 6 in

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,000
screen size flagship phone, and they're

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,640
not coming back. So now it's time to

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
redefine basically what a small flagship

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,320
phone is. And it seems like the new bar

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,559
we've set is 6.3 in. So if a screen size

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
of a flagship phone is under 6.3 in,

18
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,520
then that's one of the smallest flagship

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,920
phones. So iPhone 16 is a 6.1 in screen.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,560
Galaxy S25 is a 6.2 in screen. Xiaomi 15

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,080
is right around 6.3. And this new phone,

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,640
this OnePlus 13S, is one of the best

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,320
small flagship phones out there at 6.3

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,439
in. And if you're willing to accept that

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,400
that is the new bar, then this is kind

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,799
of like the Xen Phone 10 reincarnated

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,119
except for 2025. Now, my asterisk is

28
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
this phone is not coming to the US. So,

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,720
if you're here, that's kind of a bummer

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,159
cuz I really like this phone, but it's

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,640
not going to have all the bands required

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,920
to be great in the US. But, I got my

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
hands on it anyway. And there's

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
basically three things you need to know.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,159
The first one is obvious. It has full

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,479
flagship specs on paper. Snapdragon 8

37
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
Elite, 12 gigs of fast RAM, and up to a

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,920
half TB of UFS 4.0 storage. And this

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
display up front is 6.3 in. Like I said,

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
extremely small and even bezels all the

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,960
way around and really easy on the eyes.

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,600
Almost 1440p resolution, still 120 Hz

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,520
LTPO and up to 1600 nits or all the way

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,799
down to 1.1 nits with PWM dimming. So,

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,399
they've cut down the size, but not

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,000
really any other qualities of the

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,640
screen. And even beyond the on paper

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
specs, this feels like a flagship phone,

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,000
too. It's compact, but this is a rock

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,080
solid phone. Also, really clicky

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,160
buttons. And then, of course, this nice

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
satin glass on the back, and it is very

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,040
up to speed on the flat front and back

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,480
aesthetic that is trendy with 2025

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,000
smartphones, which I also happen to be a

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,760
fan of. And then with this relatively

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,200
normal looking camera square on the

58
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,519
back, if this phone was like 20% bigger,

59
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
it would basically look and feel exactly

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,760
like any other normal flagship, but

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,040
thanks to its dimensions, it's a little

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,280
bit lighter, a little bit more

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,840
reachable, and a little more comfortable

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,120
in every way. But also, they have done

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,959
the OnePlus thing and that either means

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,160
nothing to you or you hear that and you

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
wse a little bit because you've watched

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,560
these videos for a while and you

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
remember that doing the OnePlus thing

70
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,239
means number one, they didn't add

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,440
wireless charging to this phone. And

72
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,280
number two, the camera is, I would just

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
say, not going to be the reason why you

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,040
buy this phone. But here's the battery

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,920
situation here. And this one is so

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,680
interesting to me. The battery is the

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,680
strongest part of the OnePlus 13S.

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,720
Inside, this thing has a

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:27,080
5,850 mAh battery, which is incredible.

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,680
Just for context, 4,000 mAh, 5,000 mAh,

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,840
5850. I mean, that's incredible. This

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
phone has easy 2-day battery life with

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,239
normal use. Like I said, Zen Phone

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
reincarnated type stuff. And I'm using

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,760
my phone at a high brightness, high

86
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,280
refresh rate, everything on endless

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
battery here. And then the cherry on top

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,519
is it's also 80 watt fast charging. So

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,680
you can always plug in for a few minutes

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,280
every couple of days and be good to go

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
again. So yeah, there's no wireless

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,000
charging and that's an easy ding. But

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,239
this is absolutely the perfect use case

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
for a silicon carbon battery. It lets us

95
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
break physics a little bit and make the

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,519
phone smaller but still have a massive

97
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,080
flagship size capacity. Is what I would

98
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,040
say if this was a silicon carbon

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,120
battery, but it's not.

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,320
All of the specs I just said are true.

101
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,759
5,850 mAh, 80 watt charging, two day

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,199
battery life, not silicon carbon. When I

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
first saw the spec sheet for this phone,

104
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
I literally assumed it was silicon

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
carbon because this is a tiny phone.

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
It's impossible, right? It can't be a

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,320
regular lithium ion battery, but it's

108
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,960
not. And that was kind of shocking. I

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,440
kind of can't believe it's not. But then

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,759
the second cherry on top for this phone

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,240
is the version they're selling in China

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,560
is going to swap out the 32 megapixel

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,600
selfie camera for a 16 megapixel smaller

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
camera and does have a silicon carbon

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,479
battery because of the different

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,160
priorities in that market. So that

117
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,160
version is a

118
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,240
6,260 milliamp

119
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,680
battery. Wow. I cannot imagine how good

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,360
the battery life of that phone is going

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,960
to be. Either way, the battery is a huge

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
highlight of this phone. It's pretty

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
sick. Now, the cameras, as I mentioned,

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,919
not so much. I mean, they're fine.

125
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,919
You've heard this about OnePlus phones

126
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,520
in the past. They're passible. They're

127
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,600
just not going to be the reason you buy

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,160
this phone. This is the same sensor as

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
the ROG Phone 9 and the Moto Edge 50,

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,639
just to give you an idea. And they chose

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,759
to pair that main camera with a 2x

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,759
telephoto for some reason instead of an

133
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
ultrawide or a better zoom. But you can

134
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,440
immediately get much more out of an S25

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,199
with its triple cameras, for example, or

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,639
even others with a dual camera where one

137
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
of them is an ultrawide. But the third

138
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,600
and final thing you should know about

139
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:42,000
this phone is that OnePlus's AI has

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
arrived on it. Uh, and I've been testing

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
it for a little while. It's one of those

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,800
things that again, you can easily dive

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,520
all the way into it or totally ignore it

144
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,880
and not use any of it. I tend to not use

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,320
a lot of this stuff, but of course they

146
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,680
want to make it as easy as possible to

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,120
dive right in because they've replaced

148
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
the usual beloved alert slider with a

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
single button here. And you can see

150
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,039
where this is going. This is a

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
customizable button called the plus key.

152
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,880
And sure enough, just like the iPhone's

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,960
action button, they've built a special

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,039
very dark UI that they've stapled into

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,880
their settings app for customizing

156
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,600
exactly how you want this button to

157
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,319
behave. And the default is saving

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,880
whatever you're doing to the mind space,

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,280
which is this AI organized memory bank

160
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
for all your screenshots and taking

161
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,960
action on them and pulling information

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,919
out of them later. Pretty damn similar

163
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,080
to the nothing phones essential space.

164
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,759
I've talked about this before. Cool

165
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,479
concept. Like every once in a while,

166
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,319
it's that really cool useful thing. Like

167
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,319
someone sends you a text with a

168
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
screenshot of a concert poster and then

169
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,319
you can like save it and get the

170
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,479
information later. is nice, but it also

171
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,240
doesn't work anywhere outside of this

172
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
phone. So, it doesn't sync anywhere. I

173
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,600
can't triage this on a bigger screen on

174
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,440
my laptop or something like that. So, it

175
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,039
breaks my number one rule of

176
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,639
organizational software of not being

177
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,800
multiplatform. But, there's also other

178
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,199
little stuff like there's an AI editor

179
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,759
in the photos app now that will unblur

180
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,160
moving objects and erase reflections and

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,080
glass or erase background objects.

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
Pretty classic stuff that we've seen.

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,120
And there's a translate app that does

184
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,039
live audio translations for multilingual

185
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,319
conversations. Nothing like mind-blowing

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,080
or groundbreaking that we haven't

187
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
already seen on other phones before. Uh

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,199
but it is nice that OnePlus at least has

189
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,440
this stuff built in now instead of

190
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,000
relying on Google for it. Um this is

191
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,720
also coming via a software update to the

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,400
OnePlus 13. Although that phone still

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,160
has a slider instead of the button, so

194
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,160
you have to access it with a

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,440
three-finger swipe up

196
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,560
instead. I'd take the slider. Now, some

197
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,080
other little things I noticed while

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,919
dailying this phone should come with the

199
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,599
context of the price. So, here is that

200
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,240
price. It's pretty good. 650 bucks

201
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,000
roughly equivalent in the US. Again,

202
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,120
feeling like the Xen phone reincarnated,

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,639
but I did notice things like the

204
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,879
fingerprint reader under the display

205
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,879
being optical instead of the faster

206
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
ultrasonic fingerprint sensors. Not a

207
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,560
huge deal, but makes sense at this price

208
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,599
point. I also found the lack of

209
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,360
doubletapping the power button for

210
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,120
camera kind of weird on this phone. I

211
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,199
feel like 99 out of every hundred

212
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
Android phones that crosses my plate

213
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,639
automatically has double click for

214
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
camera turned on or at least lets me

215
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
easily turn it on. But unless I'm

216
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
missing something, this is like the one

217
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,879
out of a hundred that doesn't. Uh but

218
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
you can I guess remap the plus key to be

219
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
the camera quick launch if you want to

220
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,200
do that instead. But then speaking of

221
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,440
the plus key, that animation, I mean, do

222
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,519
I do I really have to say it? I mean, we

223
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
all know they just Okay, as long as

224
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,279
we're on the same page. Also, sweet new

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,560
feature that I discovered on this phone,

226
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,800
but that's probably more useful on

227
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,600
bigger phones. This icon pull down

228
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,200
gesture in Oxygen OS 15. This is so

229
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
smart. It basically just takes all of

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
your clickable icons on your home screen

231
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
and just drags them down to the corner

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,279
to make them reachable with a single

233
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,920
swipe. It is so clever. I love it. But

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,560
overall, moral of the story is the

235
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,519
benchmark for compact or small flagship

236
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,839
phones has moved up basically over 6 in

237
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,839
now. But if you want the one with the

238
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,720
best battery life, there's no question

239
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,640
this is it. Um, super smooth software,

240
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,399
super fast charging, and it has the AI

241
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
features built in now, which is great.

242
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,000
If it's a camera you're after, this

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
probably isn't the one. If you live in

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,480
the US, sorry, probably can't really get

245
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,600
one here, or if you do, it'll be kind of

246
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,399
a pain. Speaking of a pain, does your

247
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,200
dad's back hurt? Is he always constantly

248
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,880
misplacing things? Does his wallet look

249
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
like this? Your dad may be suffering

250
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,600
from something called dad wallet. We've

251
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,080
all seen it. A massive wallet that's

252
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
probably older than you, filled with who

253
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,000
knows what. Listen, it's time to upgrade

254
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,839
him for Father's Day, and Ridge has it

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,839
covered. Ridge has wallets for all sorts

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,680
of dads. There's hard wallets, soft

257
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
wallets, even some with his favorite

258
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,680
sports team. So, there's so many colors

259
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
and material options to choose from. I

260
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
can kind of already hear him saying,

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,880
"That's sharp." when he opens it for the

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
first time. And the best part, he'll

263
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,560
never misplace it again with Ridge's new

264
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
tracker card. Just slide it into the

265
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
wallet and you can always find it with

266
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,959
your iPhone. But also, I know our

267
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,880
audience and I know the analytics. And

268
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm fairly confident that a lot of you

269
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
watching this video are also dads. So,

270
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,839
you know what? Get something for

271
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,480
yourself, too. Treat yourself at the

272
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,880
