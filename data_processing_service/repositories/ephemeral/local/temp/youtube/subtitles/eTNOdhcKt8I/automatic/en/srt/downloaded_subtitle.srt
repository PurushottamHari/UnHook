2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,320
Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,519
and I am Varun Johri.  Hail

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,480
India.  A very horrific plane crash

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,400
happened in Ahmedabad and after this crash, I

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,800

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,760
received messages from many of you asking me to make a video on it.   Please

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,439
show a video in detail.  First of all I would like to apologize for the

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
delay in the release of the video

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,480
as I personally did not want

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
any such news format

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,760
video to be brought to you because it

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,079
was such a big accident so you all were already

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
taking continuous updates even before this.  You knew

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,559
what was going on in the news, what things were happening.

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,040
Are there any updates?  My aim was to

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,079
make a combined video

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,719
in which the people who were the

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,079
pilots, passengers and crew

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,440
members of this plane would also be talked about.  We should also talk about

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,079
what happened to those people in that 2

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,559
minute journey, it was a journey of only one to two minutes,

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,640
after that the plane crashed.

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,960
Along with this, we should also talk about the issue

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,600
that why

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,159
questions are being raised on Boeing not just today but for the past several years,

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,080
why such whistle blowers

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,560
emerge from Boeing, who work for Boeing,

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,840
and then suddenly one whistle blower

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,360
also died, so this should also be

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
talked about, what other

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,159
possibilities can there be apart from this?

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,799
Because of bird strike, because of fuel clogging

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,880
, why did

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
this plane crash?  So

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,240
we wanted to talk about all these possibilities and all these things and

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,159
that is why we are here today for you with a combined video.

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
And if

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,439
you get any valuable information in this video

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,439
then please share it.  Please comment and

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,759
tell us what you think?

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,200
What possibilities can there be?  Who

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,439
could make mistakes here?

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,799
Because the investigation will happen now, the

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,520
press conference happened only today and the

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,399
investigation will now go on for a long time.  It has been told

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,200
that a deadline of about one or two months has been given.

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,439
So you will know later but you

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,079
must give your opinion on this

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,040
in the comment section of this video.  Let's start today's

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,319
video.  So friends, it was the day of June 12, 2025,

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,319
around 1:30 in the afternoon.

53
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,040

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,440
An Air India

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,480
flight number AI171,

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,959
a Boeing 787 Dream Dyna aircraft, at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad.   It was

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,000

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,879

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,760
standing on runway number 23 all set to take off for its flight from Ahmedabad to London.  Meanwhile there were around 242 people in the plane at this time.

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,160
Of which there

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,760
were 230 passengers, two pilots.  There

62
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,040
were also 10 crew members.  And among these 230 passengers,

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,519
169 were Indians.  53 were from the UK.  Seven

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,319
were Portuguese and one was a Canadian citizen.  The

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:51,599
pilot of AI71 that day was 54-year-old

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,599
Captain Sumit Sawarwal.  Sumit Sawarwal is a

67
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,280
highly experienced Line Training

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,519
Captain.  Line training captains are the ones

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,840
who also train other junior captains.

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,200

72
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,879
He continuously trains the first officers and junior officers accompanying him

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
during the flight.  Was the Line Training

74
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
Captain.  Highly Experienced

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,280
Qualified.

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,239
Sumit Sawarwal had 8200 hours of

77
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,360
flying experience.  And his family's

78
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,599
background was also

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,080
from aviation.  His father is said to have been

80
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,560
an official in DGCA.  So the entire

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,640
family's background was also from that.  Sumit was

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,360
known for his professionalism and his hard working nature.  He

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,200
lived with his family in Powai, Mumbai.  And

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,519
as we told you, my father was an official in DGCA.  Just a

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,599
few days ago he had

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,840
told his father that his father was around 82 years

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,840
old.  Just a few days ago he had told

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
his father that now I will

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,480
leave my job very soon and will take care of you full time.

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,239
Because it's been a while now.

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,400
He has been a pilot.  So now he

93
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,840
wanted to take care of his elderly father.

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,840
Well, Sumit was Captain Sumit's assistant in this flight.  The

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
co-pilot or first

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,519
officer.  His age was only 34 years.  The

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,519
name was Clive Kunder.  First Officer

98
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,680
Clive Kunder.  Clive Kunder had 10100

99
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,760
hours of flying experience.  He also

100
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,760
belonged to an aviation family.  His mother

101
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,560
, she was a

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,440
crew member of Air India flight.  First,

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,320
Clive did the aircraft maintenance course from the Flying Club of Bombay.

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,080

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,800
After that, he had to stay

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
in Kalina Air India Colony in Mumbai.

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,960
But later this family

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
shifted to Borivali.  At this time Clive's

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,040
parents lived with his sister

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
in Australia.  Clive

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,919
lived alone here in India in Mumbai.

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,120
Apart from these,

113
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,080
27-year-old Roshni Sonagre was among the crew members of flight AI 171.  Roshni was a

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,479
resident of Dombili East Mumbai.  It was

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,240
her childhood dream to become an air hostess

116
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,320
and this dream came true recently when she

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
joined Air India as an air hostess.

118
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,919
Roshni was also a travel

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,880
influencer.  There

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,520
were approximately 54,000 followers on Instagram.  Another air hostess

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,800
with Roshni was

122
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Maithili Patil, 26, a resident of Panvel, Mumbai.  Maithili

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,759

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,919

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,759
became the first flight attendant from her village, where she lived in Panvel, and when she was

126
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
selected, it is said that

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,880
people in her village, her

128
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,440
neighbours,

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,080
celebrated by putting up posters and banners.

130
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
Maithili was working with Air India for 2 years.

131
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,479
He had been working for two years

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,639
and this flight from Ahmedabad to London was

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,680
his seventh international trip.   It

134
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,680
was his seventh international trip.

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
Now let's talk about the passengers of this flight.

136
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,960
Among the passengers was a very famous person, a very

137
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,240
big personality.  Former CM of Gujarat

138
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:50,000
Vijay Rupani ji.  Vijay Runi who was there

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,240
when the flight crashed on June 12.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
At this time he was incharge of BJP's Punjab.  He was

141
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,720

142
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,919
going to London to meet his wife and daughter.  Although

143
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,160
his initial plan was to leave on June 5.

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,960
But

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
due to the work of the party BJP in Punjab, some works were continuously

146
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,039
coming to light.  Because of that, he had to change his plan

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,600
and after that, his flight ticket was for

148
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,160
12th June.  Well June 12th, if you

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,720
look at it, 126 is the way it's written.

150
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,240
So this date,

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,919
this figure 126 had a different role in Rupani ji's life.

152
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,800
Because according to a report in Times of India, the

153
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,800

154
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960

155
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,000
number on the registration plate of every vehicle he owned, be it a car, scooter, etc., was always

156
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,960
126.  And coincidentally,

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,479
it was that his flight was on the same date, 12th June,

158
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,520
126.

159
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,440
From Ahmedabad to London.  Apart from Vijay Rupani

160
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
ji, there were many other passengers in the flight.

161
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,400
But there was one more passenger about whom it is

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,319
important to tell you today.  Look, there are many

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,919
people in this whose stories you know.

164
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,039
 

165
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,800
I felt that I should tell you another different story here.

166
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,120
Maybe you know or you don't

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,120
know.  Still another passenger

168
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,160
we will talk about was Sahil Patel,

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,280
just 25 years old from Saroj in Gujarat.

170
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,560
Sahil's being in this flight was

171
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,639
written by fate through a lottery.

172
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,120
In April, Sahil

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,160
received an email from the British Government informing him

174
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,800
that he had won

175
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:26,960
a two-year UK work visa under the British Government's Indian Young Professionals Scheme.  Out

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,560

177
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,800
of approximately 3000 people who applied here.

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Out of that, Sahil was selected for this 2

179
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,520
year UK work visa.  The family was

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,919
very happy.  Sahil was also very

181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
happy and

182
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,919
this flight of Sahil from Ahmedabad to London was scheduled on 12 June 2025.  Was going to

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,840
go on a work visa.  There were

184
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,479
many such stories like Sahil.  There were about

185
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,360
230 such different stories.  There were

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,000
as many stories as there were passengers.  And all of them were

187
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,840
going to London after meeting their families.

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,240
Or many of the people who had come back from London and were

189
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,759
foreigners here were

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,560
present there.  According to Flight Radar 24's

191
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:11,680
data, the aircraft

192
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,560
AI171 completely used the airport's 11499 feet long

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,639
runway number 23 for take off

194
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,319
and at exactly 1:39 pm

195
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,479
AI171 took off from Ahmedabad.

196
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,800
Everything was normal till the time this plane took off.  The

197
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,960
plane started its initial climb.

198
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,919

199
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,279
But within 1 minute, it must have been around 1:40

200
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:39,279
minutes.  When the plane

201
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,599
reached a height of 625 to 640 645 feet,

202
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,680
its signal suddenly stopped and

203
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,760
the plane started falling at a speed of 475 feet per minute.

204
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,720

205
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Meanwhile, the pilots immediately made a

206
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
call to the air traffic control (ATC).

207
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,320
Med A call is made

208
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,880
in such emergency situations.  ATC was told

209
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,120
that something was seriously wrong.  But this was

210
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,720
only the last message sent from this flight

211
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,040
by those pilots because

212
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,640
after this there was no contact with those

213
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
pilots.  There was no contact

214
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,360
because the signals had been lost.  The

215
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,920
plane started falling rapidly,

216
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,720
about 2 km away from the airport.

217
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,000
Meghani Nagar of Ahmedabad is at a distance of from the airport.

218
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,399

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
In the hostel of BJ Medical College in Meghani Nagar, where the post graduate and under

220
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,800
graduate students used to stay, the plane

221
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,200

222
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,000
goes straight from the mess of the hostel of BJ Medical College and hits the entire third

223
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,519
floor of the mess and crashes.

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,320
This was the

225
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,440
most horrific incident in the aviation history of India.  It

226
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,320
was a most horrific accident.  This plane

227
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,519
crashed.  After the crash, only balls of fire

228
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,279
and clouds of black smoke were visible all around.

229
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,240
AI 171 was completely destroyed

230
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,560
and according to the

231
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,000
figures that are in front of you till now, it is being said

232
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,240
that 280 people have lost their lives in this accident.  But this

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,279
figure is not official yet.  There

234
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,839
can be many changes in this.  May be.  We

235
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,320
would like all of you to wish that there should be no change.

236
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
Now no one else should hear such news

237
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,120
that this figure is big.  So anyway, it is being

238
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,519
told that around 280 people have lost their

239
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
lives, which include passengers

240
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,040
, crew members and students living in that hostel.

241
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,279
Well, nothing can be

242
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,079
said about this figure right now.

243
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,360
But after this accident a miracle

244
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,880
also happened which the whole world and the

245
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,959
whole country witnessed.  When the people from the vicinity

246
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,279
reached the spot when the crash happened, there were

247
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,680
badly burnt dead bodies of the passengers lying everywhere on the plane side.  Was

248
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,760
looking at them.  Was

249
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,480
trying to help them.  At the same time,

250
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,880
a badly

251
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,480
injured person was seen coming out from there.   The

252
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,440
name was Vishwas Kumar Ramesh.  Vishwas was actually

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,760
a passenger on the same flight AI171.   He had

254
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,320
come to India to meet his family

255
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,480
and was with his brother, his brother's

256
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,440
name was Ajay Kumar Ramesh.  I was

257
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,480
going back to London from Ahmedabad with him.  Vishwas

258
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,440
's survival was a miracle as

259
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,040
he was the only survivor of the plane crash.

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,680
Lone Survivor.  This is the case which is

261
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,440
considered in the case of rest.  This

262
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,519
happens very rarely.  There have been

263
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,839
many major plane crashes around the world.   It is

264
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,800
very rare that a single

265
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,480
person survives.  Vishwas's

266
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,120
seat was 11A in the first row of economy class.

267
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279

268
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,040

269
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:48,079
Vishwas's brother Ajay was

270
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,880
sitting in the second row of the plane, just behind the business cabin and close to the emergency exit on the left side.  The seats of both of them were

271
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,480
different.  When

272
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,079
Vishwas spoke to the authorities, later when he was

273
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,760
taken to the hospital, he

274
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,320
also spoke to the media people.

275
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,160
He said that

276
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
he basically asked about his brother, where he is, but

277
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
he also doesn't know.  I did not find him anywhere.

278
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,600
So he said that both of us were

279
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,519
roaming together.  We had come together

280
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,839
and I had also gone for a walk with my brother.

281
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,680
Daman and The also went.  He was travelling with me.

282
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,279
But now I don't know

283
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,560
where he is.  I am not able to find them.

284
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,160
Please help me find them.

285
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,959
He also appealed to the media for his brother.

286
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,920
But the question is,

287
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,240

288
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,480
how did Vishwas survive such a horrific plane crash?  That is a very good thing for the rest.

289
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,320
But how did this happen?  He

290
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,800
himself told about this.  So he said that the

291
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
side I was sitting on

292
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,040
collapsed to the ground floor of the building.  That means that

293
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,440
seat and its entire portion

294
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,320
fell on the ground floor of the building.  As far as we

295
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,399
can estimate, this impact would have happened.  There

296
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,240
was a little space there.  He also said this.  When

297
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,200
the door broke, I

298
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,279
saw that place and I jumped down.  The

299
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,279
pictures that emerged from the crash site also confirm this.

300
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,440
This thing which he told was

301
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,600
also confirmed.  Actually the

302
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,639
middle section of the plane and the tail which was

303
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,440
in the middle were badly burnt.  But the

304
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,800
part of the forward fuselage was

305
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,760
slightly damaged even before the fire broke out.  This

306
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,920
is visible from the front.  Due to which a small exit path was created

307
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
and this was the same exit path which was the

308
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,279
path of life for Vishwas.  It

309
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,120
became a way of life for him.  At

310
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,240
present, Vishwas is

311
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,000
admitted in ward number B7 of Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad.

312
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,279
Coincidentally, it is being said that the

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,519
bed he got was also number 11.  His seat

314
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,680
number was also 11A in this plane.

315
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,079
So these are many coincidences associated with this crash.

316
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,360
They are being monitored 24 hours a day

317
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,000
and the guards and

318
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,399
officers, Gujarat Police

319
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,040
officers are also present there for their safety.

320
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,279
But such a miracle has

321
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,680
not happened for the first time.  We have seen this before as well in the world's

322
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,399
most horrific, horrific and dangerous plane crashes.

323
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,360
In 1987, a four-

324
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,360
year-old girl, Selena Detroit, was the sole survivor of the

325
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,760
crash of Northwest Flight 255.

326
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,920
Everyone including the four year old girl had been

327
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,000
killed.  She was the only one left.

328
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,399
In 2009, 12-year-old Bahia Bacarari was the

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,639
sole survivor of the Flight 626 crash.  She

330
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:19,040
was the only survivor.  And in 2006, copilot Jim

331
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:22,320
Kachuri was the lone survivor of the Jim Kachuri Kumar crash.

332
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,160
So all these things

333
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,720
come to light that this has happened before.  But this is

334
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,399

335
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,839
considered the rest of the rarest of rare cases.  Friends, before we proceed further in the video,

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,560
Now let's move ahead with our episode.

358
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,959
Well, after the crash of Air India plane AI71,

359
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,720
many questions are being raised on Boeing.

360
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,880
Boeing

361
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,440
also issued a statement after this crash.  He

362
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,240
said that we are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171

363
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,480
and

364
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,959
we are ready to give them our support.   It

365
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,720
's absolutely fine.  But now this is an issue which is under

366
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,880
investigation and India's

367
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,839
Aircraft Accident Intelligence (

368
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Investigation Bureau), US's NSB

369
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,800
and G Space as well as the UK's Air

370
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
Accident Investigation

371
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Department are now thoroughly investigating it.

372
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,199
India's Civil Aviation Minister has

373
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:51,279

374
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,519

375
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,360
ordered extra safety inspection on Air India's flight 787, which was the Dream Liner, flights 7878 and 7879.  All these

376
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
things are going on.  But it has not been known yet

377
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,880
and it will take

378
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,240
time to know what was the exact cause of this crash

379
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,560
?  Why did this happen?  But now we will

380
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,639
talk about some analysis that has come out and

381
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,320
about which the experts are

382
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,199
talking.  What all things can happen?

383
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,560
Aviation experts say

384
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,120
that the crash of Air India plane

385
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,920
probably happened due to failure of both the engines.  It is

386
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,399
considered very rare that

387
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,199
both the engines of an aircraft fail.

388
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,199
Double engine failures occur occasionally.  Like

389
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,360
the plane crash of 2000 which you may

390
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,360
also know as the Miracle on the Hutson.

391
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,920
What happened in this was that due to bird strike

392
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,160
both the engines of the plane had stopped.

393
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,639
But with his presence of mind, the pilot

394
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,839

395
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,600
landed the plane safely on Hutson River.  Apart from this, these

396
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,759
things are also coming to light.  It is being said that the

397
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,160
engine sound is not visible in the crash footage.  I ca

398
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,240
n't hear it.  Which

399
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
points towards dual engine failure, as

400
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,759
both the engines were faulty and hence the crash sound is

401
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,639
not heard in that video.  A lot of

402
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,720
footage has emerged.  Another theory is

403
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,880
that there could be fuel contamination or clogging.  Due to

404
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,559
which the fuel system gets blocked

405
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,720
and the engines stop working.

406
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,839
So the cause of fuel contamination is

407
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,600
coming to the fore here.  Apart from this,

408
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,720
a big possibility of bird strike is being raised.  It is being

409
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,559
said that there can be

410
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,199
a huge possibility of bird strike.

411
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,039
Because the issue of birds is common near Ahmedabad.

412
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,640

413
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,160
According to the data of the Ministry, it has been told that there have been

414
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,400
462 bird strikes in Gujarat in 5 years

415
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,440
and most of them have

416
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,760
happened in the Ahmedabad region.

417
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,160
You all must be aware of an incident of December 2024.  Recently, there was a very

418
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,200
scary plane crash.  There was the Jeju Air

419
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,799
Crash.  Jeju Flight 226 crashed.

420
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,799
179 people were killed there too.

421
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,720
Bird strike has been said to be the only possibility in it.

422
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,480
Finally, due to bird strike,

423
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,679
both the engines of the plane stopped working

424
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,679
and the plane crashed.  Some

425
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,919
aviation experts are also saying that the

426
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,600
wing flaps of the plane were not in the correct position

427
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,200
at the time of take-off and this is being said after looking at the

428
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,880
video which has shown that the

429
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,679
wing flaps of the plane were

430
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,919
not in the correct position at the time of take-off.  Which

431
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,760

432
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,679
can cause problems while gaining the thrust that is generated while lifting the plane.

433
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,520
Well, this possibility should be completely

434
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,440
ruled out because first of all, the

435
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
configuration warning system of the plane

436
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,080

437
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,240
keeps giving alerts for such mistakes.  The second thing is that the pilots

438
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,400
of this plane were highly experienced

439
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,640
pilots.  8400 hours of 8200 hours of

440
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,280
flying experience matters brother.

441
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,760
So no question can be raised here regarding the pilots.  There were

442
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,679
highly experienced

443
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,280
pilots.  So this issue of flaps which is being

444
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,919
talked about is a possibility and its

445
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,120
chances are almost zero.  This cannot happen.

446
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,200
Apart from this, the issue of runway length is also being

447
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,720
raised.  It is being said that the plane

448
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,440
probably took off by using the entire 1900 metre runway.

449
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,160
Whereas for Boeing 787 a

450
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,240
runway of 2820 meters is required.

451
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,240
This is very technical.  Some

452
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,919
action experts have

453
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,160
also posted about it on social media.  It is written.

454
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,440
Well, all this matter of investigation will now be

455
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,520
cleared in the investigation.  But the main

456
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,600
thing that comes forward now is

457
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,320
why questions are being raised on Boeing?

458
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,640
Friends, the questions that are raised on Boeing are not being raised from today but from the past many

459
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,280
years by the people working in Boeing itself.

460
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,240

461
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,360
John Burnett had worked at Boeing for nearly 30 years and retired in 2017,

462
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,520
but suddenly one day

463
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
his body was found inside a truck in Charleston.  Now

464
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,840
listen to what was told about this.

465
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Reports say that

466
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,760
John was a whistle blower in a law suit against Boeing.  He was

467
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,320
continuously giving evidence against Boeing.

468
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,160
They used the 787 Dreamliner, the same aircraft that was

469
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,400
used here as well.  Serious issues like

470
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,880
sub-standard parts in its production

471
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,440
and 25% oxygen system failures were

472
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,760
raised.  John

473
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,679
claimed that in order to quickly

474
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,000

475
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,400
manufacture aircraft parts,

476
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,720
workers at Boeing

477
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,280
pick up material from scrap bins and install defective parts in them.

478
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,840
Although when

479
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,919
this matter was brought to the notice of Boeing and then F21,

480
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,320
Boeing denied it, but

481
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,400

482
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,720
in the 2017 review report of F21, some

483
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,559
claims were found to be true that something like this was happening.  There were

484
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,080
around 54 parts in which

485
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:21,280
John's claim was found to be correct.  Well,

486
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,760

487
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,679
after John's retirement in 2017, he

488
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,159
started his legal fight against Boeing.

489
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,679
Because he had noticed that

490
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
during his last tenure when he was working at Boeing,

491
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,840
he had started raising his voice against

492
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,840
these things.  So he said that

493
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,760
during his last tenure, the company

494
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,400

495
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,600
gave him a lot of problems regarding his character, raised issues,

496
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,200
completely harmed his career and

497
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,520
because he was continuously raising all these issues, he had to

498
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,200
face all these problems.  Last

499
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,280
week in April it was reported that John

500
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Boeing had a court

501
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,039
session with his lawyers.  There, the debate was being

502
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,280
held by their groups.  He had

503
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,000
presented a lot of evidence at that time.  But

504
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,320
after this he did not come for the next session.

505
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,120
When he did not return, he was searched for

506
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,600
and

507
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,280
his body was found inside a parked truck in the parking lot of a hotel.

508
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,840
His body is found from there.

509
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,840
Apart from this, this is a very serious case.

510
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,320
Apart from these, Sam Salapur was an

511
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,080
employee of Boeing for 17 years.  Had worked in Boeing for 17 years.  He

512
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,520
was an engineer.

513
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,240
He had repeatedly complained about shortcuts in the production of the 787 Dreamliner, the same aircraft, in 2021 and 22.

514
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,600

515
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,679
In April 204,

516
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,919
he also told the US Congress that

517
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:40,159
in 2020, Boeing had used wrong shortcuts in

518
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,919
fit-up force and one-up assembly, two

519
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,000
things for early delivery, due to which the

520
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,679

521
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,440
fuses, which are the fuse leg gaps, may have

522
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,039
problems in them.  They might be under stress.

523
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,760
Because the force that is being used to

524
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,000
make these right now is

525
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,000
many times more than the force that Boeing is using.

526
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,520
As much as should be actually invested.

527
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,360
He even said that

528
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,520
all these

529
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,200
things that Boeing currently tells its workers about

530
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,640
how to work are totally against the standards.

531
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,039
He also accused the

532
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,840
workers of jumping on the parts like Tarzan of the plane, which is

533
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,520

534
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,919
not the way to work.

535
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,799
This

536
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,520
can increase the gaps on any plane or aircraft.  When Sam had raised serious concerns with Boeing,

537
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,360
he had

538
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,039

539
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,200
raised it even when he was working there because he had become a whistle blower.

540
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,360
After this, he said that

541
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,760
Boeing always ignored his serious concerns and harassed him.

542
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,799
After this,

543
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,400

544
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,480

545
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,480

546
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,919
Boeing shifted him from 787 to

547
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,240
Triple 7, which is Triple 7, to the program of that flat.  I was

548
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,480

549
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,559
asked to keep quiet and was threatened.

550
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,200
Sam also told all these things.

551
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,799
Here he also said that there is

552
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
no safety culture at all in Boeing.  Whistle

553
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,080
bearers are those who raise any voice, if

554
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,400
any apple sees something wrong

555
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,159
then it is suppressed.  So

556
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,080
all these things raise questions about Boeing.

557
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,360
Also there is a Robert, a Whistle

558
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Broker named Robert.  He also

559
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,039
raised similar concerns against Boeing.

560
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,600
Well, let's talk about India.

561
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,280
Many questions are now being raised about Air India in India.

562
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,799

563
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,919
People are saying a lot of things on social media.

564
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:25,120
But among these, one such allegation

565
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,559
or let us say a serious concern was raised.

566
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,799

567
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,120
Gaurav Taneja has also been a former Uber pilot.  He

568
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,640
posted a serious concern about X on Twitter.  After which

569
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,320
this concern also came up in media reports.

570
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,159
Meaning, it was

571
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,960
also shown by many media channels.  Good proper

572
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,440
newspapers published it.

573
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,039
Basically Gaurav Taneja said

574
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,880
what he wrote in his post.  He said

575
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:51,039
serious flight safety concerns were raised against Air Asia in May 2020.

576
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,919

577
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,559
In the DGCA investigation, safety

578
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,799
violations were detected and two

579
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,880
top officials,

580
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,760
including Air Asia's then head of

581
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,840
operations, Captain Manish Upal, were suspended.  If we

582
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,280
look at the reports,

583
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,240
this thing also comes to light.  It is also clearly published

584
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,559
in the reports of that time of 2020.  But

585
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,120

586
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,919
instead of fixing the safety issues, the airline

587
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,080
fired the whistleblower who raised his voice.

588
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,600
As far as Taneja is concerned, he is talking about himself here.

589
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,840
And now Air Asia, at this time

590
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,840
when the merger of Air Asia Vistara and Air India

591
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,120
happened, when all of these were merged.

592
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,200
After this, the same Captain Manishpal is made the

593
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,520
Senior Vice President of

594
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,320
Flight Operations of Air India.  So in

595
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,600
this way, indirectly, the

596
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,679
reinstatement of Manish Ul was done,

597
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
after suspending him from this position, he was

598
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,600
made the Senior Vice President of Flight Operations of

599
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,279
Air India and after that,

600
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,039
such things have happened in Air India itself.  Along with

601
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,279
this, many times videos come out

602
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,799
that the AC is not working in the flight.   In

603
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,400
fact, ever since this crash happened,

604
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,799
many videos are continuously coming out.

605
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,279
AC does not work in many flights.   The

606
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,120
cabin crew, the crew members do

607
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,640
not come forward to talk.   He is

608
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,200
not coming even when called.  People and

609
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,799
passengers had to face a lot of difficulties.

610
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,360
So all these things are constantly

611
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,679
coming to light.  Well, basically the question

612
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,840
friends is where did the mistake go?  Whose

613
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,520
was it?  And what exactly happened in those moments?  And

614
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,120
all this will come out.  This

615
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
investigation has started because a

616
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,480
black box has been found

617
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,760
from the roof top of the building at the crash site.  The

618
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,559
double AIB team, the

619
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,960
airport investigation bureau

620
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,159
and a

621
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,799
team of about 40 people from the Gujarat government were monitoring there.

622
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,520
Just yesterday, i.e. on the 13th, at around 5:30 pm,

623
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,600
40 of those officers recovered this black box.  The

624
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,320
DGC will now

625
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,159
continuously analyse its recordings.

626
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,080
After this, investigation of the second black box is also going on

627
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,200
continuously.

628
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,120
He was at the front of the aircraft.  What is a black box basically

629
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,440
?  This is a very common question

630
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,799
that people ask a lot of times.  There are many people

631
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,960
who do not know about this.

632
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,400
Then later they go and see.  You guys

633
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,120
know, it's a very good thing.  But the black

634
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,240
box is basically a device

635
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,880
that records flight data.

636
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,200
Whether the plane crashes,

637
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,360
catches fire or the plane is in water,

638
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,400
it can withstand the water pressure.  It

639
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,400
never causes any harm to it.  It was created

640
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,559
by an Australian scientist, David Boren.

641
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,720
It was invented by them.

642
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,640
And the black

643
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,880
box basically has two parts.

644
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,520
This is the main thing.  This is where the whole

645
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,840
game is.  It has two parts.  The first is

646
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,320
called the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).  The

647
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,880
CVR keeps

648
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,960
recording the conversations between the pilots and the sounds in the cockpit.

649
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,600
And Flight Data Recorder (FDR)

650
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,919
these are basically more than 80 such

651
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,840
parameters which it

652
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,919
monitors.  But mainly

653
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,400
it includes details of altitude, air speed and

654
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,159
heading.  Whatever these things are there in

655
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,919
an airplane, he keeps saving all of these.  By

656
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,600
now

657
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,520
you all must have understood how this will help in the investigation

658
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,520
but still let it be told.  The

659
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,840
CVR keeps recording the pilot's conversation and engine

660
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,400
sounds.

661
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,799
So it will be seen there

662
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,440
what happened in the last moments inside that plane,

663
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,520
within those one or two minutes.  The second thing

664
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,000
is FDR which keeps track of 80 plus parameters like

665
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,000
altitude, air speed, pitch,

666
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,400
all of which we just told you about.

667
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,679
So from here also it will be seen

668
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,240

669
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,400
what happened with the main plane from the time it crashed till the impact.

670
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,720
Now this data is still being analyzed.

671
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,039
You all know.  Usually it

672
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,279
takes 20 days to one month.  It has been

673
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,360

674
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,840
seen in many old cases of plane crashes, and even in missing planes, it has

675
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,559
often been seen

676
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,799
that if the black box is found somewhere,

677
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,960
then it takes time to investigate it.

678
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,720
Usually it may take around 20 to 1 month.

679
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,200
But now, friends, only this black box will be

680
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,840

681
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,399

682
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,880
able to tell us the real reason behind the med call or warnings of the Ahmedabad plane crash and will be able to clarify

683
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,480
why the plane crashed after take-off.

684
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,440
So friends, today's episode was very

685
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,760
scary.  Whatever things I have seen in these two days were

686
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,799
painful.  It was

687
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,640
going to make you cry.   There were

688
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,559
around 242 people in that plane.

689
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,840
After that, in the hostel, where the

690
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,120
people were eating food.  Plates are kept in the mess.

691
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,880
Food has been served in them and is

692
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,440
lying there in the same condition.

693
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,200
Things have been ruined from here to there.  Many kids

694
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,159
who were doctors, post graduates,

695
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,640
PG medical students,

696
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,440
their families also lived there.  Wife,

697
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,200
kids, maid

698
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,760
and the situation are such that after seeing it

699
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,159
you wonder for once why did this happen?

700
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,840
How did it happen, why, why was it

701
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:05,039
necessary to happen, so it was a very horrific,

702
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,039
painful plane crush and

703
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,919
what possibilities do you think about it,

704
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,960
do tell us in the comment section, it took a day to

705
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,520

706
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,679
we personally wanted that

707
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,159
in this video for you, all the combined events should be

708
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,240
brought, there should not be any news segment video

709
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,360
that just the news came and told you that

710
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,480
thing,
