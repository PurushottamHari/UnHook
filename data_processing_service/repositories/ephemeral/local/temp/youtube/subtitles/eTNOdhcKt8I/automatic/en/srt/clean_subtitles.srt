Study IQ IS Your Selection Our Mission.  Hello friends, you are watching Study IQ and I am Varun Johri.  Hail India.  A very horrific plane crash happened in Ahmedabad and after this crash, I received messages from many of you asking me to make a video on it.   Please show a video in detail.  First of all I would like to apologize for the delay in the release of the video as I personally did not want any such news format video to be brought to you because it was such a big accident so you all were already taking continuous updates even before this.  You knew what was going on in the news, what things were happening. Are there any updates?  My aim was to make a combined video in which the people who were the pilots, passengers and crew members of this plane would also be talked about.  We should also talk about what happened to those people in that 2 minute journey, it was a journey of only one to two minutes, after that the plane crashed. Along with this, we should also talk about the issue that why questions are being raised on Boeing not just today but for the past several years, why such whistle blowers emerge from Boeing, who work for Boeing, and then suddenly one whistle blower also died, so this should also be talked about, what other possibilities can there be apart from this? Because of bird strike, because of fuel clogging , why did this plane crash?  So we wanted to talk about all these possibilities and all these things and that is why we are here today for you with a combined video. And if you get any valuable information in this video then please share it.  Please comment and tell us what you think? What possibilities can there be?  Who could make mistakes here? Because the investigation will happen now, the press conference happened only today and the investigation will now go on for a long time.  It has been told that a deadline of about one or two months has been given. So you will know later but you must give your opinion on this in the comment section of this video.  Let's start today's video.  So friends, it was the day of June 12, 2025, around 1:30 in the afternoon. An Air India flight number AI171, a Boeing 787 Dream Dyna aircraft, at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad.   It was standing on runway number 23 all set to take off for its flight from Ahmedabad to London.  Meanwhile there were around 242 people in the plane at this time. Of which there were 230 passengers, two pilots.  There were also 10 crew members.  And among these 230 passengers, 169 were Indians.  53 were from the UK.  Seven were Portuguese and one was a Canadian citizen.  The pilot of AI71 that day was 54-year-old Captain Sumit Sawarwal.  Sumit Sawarwal is a highly experienced Line Training Captain.  Line training captains are the ones who also train other junior captains. He continuously trains the first officers and junior officers accompanying him during the flight.  Was the Line Training Captain.  Highly Experienced Qualified. Sumit Sawarwal had 8200 hours of flying experience.  And his family's background was also from aviation.  His father is said to have been an official in DGCA.  So the entire family's background was also from that.  Sumit was known for his professionalism and his hard working nature.  He lived with his family in Powai, Mumbai.  And as we told you, my father was an official in DGCA.  Just a few days ago he had told his father that his father was around 82 years old.  Just a few days ago he had told his father that now I will leave my job very soon and will take care of you full time. Because it's been a while now. He has been a pilot.  So now he wanted to take care of his elderly father. Well, Sumit was Captain Sumit's assistant in this flight.  The co-pilot or first officer.  His age was only 34 years.  The name was Clive Kunder.  First Officer Clive Kunder.  Clive Kunder had 10100 hours of flying experience.  He also belonged to an aviation family.  His mother , she was a crew member of Air India flight.  First, Clive did the aircraft maintenance course from the Flying Club of Bombay. After that, he had to stay in Kalina Air India Colony in Mumbai. But later this family shifted to Borivali.  At this time Clive's parents lived with his sister in Australia.  Clive lived alone here in India in Mumbai. Apart from these, 27-year-old Roshni Sonagre was among the crew members of flight AI 171.  Roshni was a resident of Dombili East Mumbai.  It was her childhood dream to become an air hostess and this dream came true recently when she joined Air India as an air hostess. Roshni was also a travel influencer.  There were approximately 54,000 followers on Instagram.  Another air hostess with Roshni was Maithili Patil, 26, a resident of Panvel, Mumbai.  Maithili became the first flight attendant from her village, where she lived in Panvel, and when she was selected, it is said that people in her village, her neighbours, celebrated by putting up posters and banners. Maithili was working with Air India for 2 years. He had been working for two years and this flight from Ahmedabad to London was his seventh international trip.   It was his seventh international trip. Now let's talk about the passengers of this flight. Among the passengers was a very famous person, a very big personality.  Former CM of Gujarat Vijay Rupani ji.  Vijay Runi who was there when the flight crashed on June 12. At this time he was incharge of BJP's Punjab.  He was going to London to meet his wife and daughter.  Although his initial plan was to leave on June 5. But due to the work of the party BJP in Punjab, some works were continuously coming to light.  Because of that, he had to change his plan and after that, his flight ticket was for 12th June.  Well June 12th, if you look at it, 126 is the way it's written. So this date, this figure 126 had a different role in Rupani ji's life. Because according to a report in Times of India, the number on the registration plate of every vehicle he owned, be it a car, scooter, etc., was always 126.  And coincidentally, it was that his flight was on the same date, 12th June, 126. From Ahmedabad to London.  Apart from Vijay Rupani ji, there were many other passengers in the flight. But there was one more passenger about whom it is important to tell you today.  Look, there are many people in this whose stories you know. I felt that I should tell you another different story here. Maybe you know or you don't know.  Still another passenger we will talk about was Sahil Patel, just 25 years old from Saroj in Gujarat. Sahil's being in this flight was written by fate through a lottery. In April, Sahil received an email from the British Government informing him that he had won a two-year UK work visa under the British Government's Indian Young Professionals Scheme.  Out of approximately 3000 people who applied here. Out of that, Sahil was selected for this 2 year UK work visa.  The family was very happy.  Sahil was also very happy and this flight of Sahil from Ahmedabad to London was scheduled on 12 June 2025.  Was going to go on a work visa.  There were many such stories like Sahil.  There were about 230 such different stories.  There were as many stories as there were passengers.  And all of them were going to London after meeting their families. Or many of the people who had come back from London and were foreigners here were present there.  According to Flight Radar 24's data, the aircraft AI171 completely used the airport's 11499 feet long runway number 23 for take off and at exactly 1:39 pm AI171 took off from Ahmedabad. Everything was normal till the time this plane took off.  The plane started its initial climb. But within 1 minute, it must have been around 1:40 minutes.  When the plane reached a height of 625 to 640 645 feet, its signal suddenly stopped and the plane started falling at a speed of 475 feet per minute. Meanwhile, the pilots immediately made a call to the air traffic control (ATC). Med A call is made in such emergency situations.  ATC was told that something was seriously wrong.  But this was only the last message sent from this flight by those pilots because after this there was no contact with those pilots.  There was no contact because the signals had been lost.  The plane started falling rapidly, about 2 km away from the airport. Meghani Nagar of Ahmedabad is at a distance of from the airport. In the hostel of BJ Medical College in Meghani Nagar, where the post graduate and under graduate students used to stay, the plane goes straight from the mess of the hostel of BJ Medical College and hits the entire third floor of the mess and crashes. This was the most horrific incident in the aviation history of India.  It was a most horrific accident.  This plane crashed.  After the crash, only balls of fire and clouds of black smoke were visible all around. AI 171 was completely destroyed and according to the figures that are in front of you till now, it is being said that 280 people have lost their lives in this accident.  But this figure is not official yet.  There can be many changes in this.  May be.  We would like all of you to wish that there should be no change. Now no one else should hear such news that this figure is big.  So anyway, it is being told that around 280 people have lost their lives, which include passengers , crew members and students living in that hostel. Well, nothing can be said about this figure right now. But after this accident a miracle also happened which the whole world and the whole country witnessed.  When the people from the vicinity reached the spot when the crash happened, there were badly burnt dead bodies of the passengers lying everywhere on the plane side.  Was looking at them.  Was trying to help them.  At the same time, a badly injured person was seen coming out from there.   The name was Vishwas Kumar Ramesh.  Vishwas was actually a passenger on the same flight AI171.   He had come to India to meet his family and was with his brother, his brother's name was Ajay Kumar Ramesh.  I was going back to London from Ahmedabad with him.  Vishwas 's survival was a miracle as he was the only survivor of the plane crash. Lone Survivor.  This is the case which is considered in the case of rest.  This happens very rarely.  There have been many major plane crashes around the world.   It is very rare that a single person survives.  Vishwas's seat was 11A in the first row of economy class. Vishwas's brother Ajay was sitting in the second row of the plane, just behind the business cabin and close to the emergency exit on the left side.  The seats of both of them were different.  When Vishwas spoke to the authorities, later when he was taken to the hospital, he also spoke to the media people. He said that he basically asked about his brother, where he is, but he also doesn't know.  I did not find him anywhere. So he said that both of us were roaming together.  We had come together and I had also gone for a walk with my brother. Daman and The also went.  He was travelling with me. But now I don't know where he is.  I am not able to find them. Please help me find them. He also appealed to the media for his brother. But the question is, how did Vishwas survive such a horrific plane crash?  That is a very good thing for the rest. But how did this happen?  He himself told about this.  So he said that the side I was sitting on collapsed to the ground floor of the building.  That means that seat and its entire portion fell on the ground floor of the building.  As far as we can estimate, this impact would have happened.  There was a little space there.  He also said this.  When the door broke, I saw that place and I jumped down.  The pictures that emerged from the crash site also confirm this. This thing which he told was also confirmed.  Actually the middle section of the plane and the tail which was in the middle were badly burnt.  But the part of the forward fuselage was slightly damaged even before the fire broke out.  This is visible from the front.  Due to which a small exit path was created and this was the same exit path which was the path of life for Vishwas.  It became a way of life for him.  At present, Vishwas is admitted in ward number B7 of Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad. Coincidentally, it is being said that the bed he got was also number 11.  His seat number was also 11A in this plane. So these are many coincidences associated with this crash. They are being monitored 24 hours a day and the guards and officers, Gujarat Police officers are also present there for their safety. But such a miracle has not happened for the first time.  We have seen this before as well in the world's most horrific, horrific and dangerous plane crashes. In 1987, a four- year-old girl, Selena Detroit, was the sole survivor of the crash of Northwest Flight 255. Everyone including the four year old girl had been killed.  She was the only one left. In 2009, 12-year-old Bahia Bacarari was the sole survivor of the Flight 626 crash.  She was the only survivor.  And in 2006, copilot Jim Kachuri was the lone survivor of the Jim Kachuri Kumar crash. So all these things come to light that this has happened before.  But this is considered the rest of the rarest of rare cases.

Boeing also issued a statement after this crash.  He said that we are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171 and we are ready to give them our support.   It 's absolutely fine.  But now this is an issue which is under investigation and India's Aircraft Accident Intelligence ( Investigation Bureau), US's NSB and G Space as well as the UK's Air Accident Investigation Department are now thoroughly investigating it. India's Civil Aviation Minister has ordered extra safety inspection on Air India's flight 787, which was the Dream Liner, flights 7878 and 7879.  All these things are going on.  But it has not been known yet and it will take time to know what was the exact cause of this crash ?  Why did this happen?  But now we will talk about some analysis that has come out and about which the experts are talking.  What all things can happen? Aviation experts say that the crash of Air India plane probably happened due to failure of both the engines.  It is considered very rare that both the engines of an aircraft fail. Double engine failures occur occasionally.  Like the plane crash of 2000 which you may also know as the Miracle on the Hutson. What happened in this was that due to bird strike both the engines of the plane had stopped. But with his presence of mind, the pilot landed the plane safely on Hutson River.  Apart from this, these things are also coming to light.  It is being said that the engine sound is not visible in the crash footage.  I ca n't hear it.  Which points towards dual engine failure, as both the engines were faulty and hence the crash sound is not heard in that video.  A lot of footage has emerged.  Another theory is that there could be fuel contamination or clogging.  Due to which the fuel system gets blocked and the engines stop working. So the cause of fuel contamination is coming to the fore here.  Apart from this, a big possibility of bird strike is being raised.  It is being said that there can be a huge possibility of bird strike. Because the issue of birds is common near Ahmedabad. According to the data of the Ministry, it has been told that there have been 462 bird strikes in Gujarat in 5 years and most of them have happened in the Ahmedabad region. You all must be aware of an incident of December 2024.  Recently, there was a very scary plane crash.  There was the Jeju Air Crash.  Jeju Flight 226 crashed. 179 people were killed there too. Bird strike has been said to be the only possibility in it. Finally, due to bird strike, both the engines of the plane stopped working and the plane crashed.  Some aviation experts are also saying that the wing flaps of the plane were not in the correct position at the time of take-off and this is being said after looking at the video which has shown that the wing flaps of the plane were not in the correct position at the time of take-off.  Which can cause problems while gaining the thrust that is generated while lifting the plane. Well, this possibility should be completely ruled out because first of all, the configuration warning system of the plane keeps giving alerts for such mistakes.  The second thing is that the pilots of this plane were highly experienced pilots.  8400 hours of 8200 hours of flying experience matters brother. So no question can be raised here regarding the pilots.  There were highly experienced pilots.  So this issue of flaps which is being talked about is a possibility and its chances are almost zero.  This cannot happen. Apart from this, the issue of runway length is also being raised.  It is being said that the plane probably took off by using the entire 1900 metre runway. Whereas for Boeing 787 a runway of 2820 meters is required. This is very technical.  Some action experts have also posted about it on social media.  It is written. Well, all this matter of investigation will now be cleared in the investigation.  But the main thing that comes forward now is why questions are being raised on Boeing? Friends, the questions that are raised on Boeing are not being raised from today but from the past many years by the people working in Boeing itself. John Burnett had worked at Boeing for nearly 30 years and retired in 2017, but suddenly one day his body was found inside a truck in Charleston.  Now listen to what was told about this. Reports say that John was a whistle blower in a law suit against Boeing.  He was continuously giving evidence against Boeing. They used the 787 Dreamliner, the same aircraft that was used here as well.  Serious issues like sub-standard parts in its production and 25% oxygen system failures were raised.  John claimed that in order to quickly manufacture aircraft parts, workers at Boeing pick up material from scrap bins and install defective parts in them. Although when this matter was brought to the notice of Boeing and then F21, Boeing denied it, but in the 2017 review report of F21, some claims were found to be true that something like this was happening.  There were around 54 parts in which John's claim was found to be correct.  Well, after John's retirement in 2017, he started his legal fight against Boeing. Because he had noticed that during his last tenure when he was working at Boeing, he had started raising his voice against these things.  So he said that during his last tenure, the company gave him a lot of problems regarding his character, raised issues, completely harmed his career and because he was continuously raising all these issues, he had to face all these problems.  Last week in April it was reported that John Boeing had a court session with his lawyers.  There, the debate was being held by their groups.  He had presented a lot of evidence at that time.  But after this he did not come for the next session. When he did not return, he was searched for and his body was found inside a parked truck in the parking lot of a hotel. His body is found from there. Apart from this, this is a very serious case. Apart from these, Sam Salapur was an employee of Boeing for 17 years.  Had worked in Boeing for 17 years.  He was an engineer. He had repeatedly complained about shortcuts in the production of the 787 Dreamliner, the same aircraft, in 2021 and 22. In April 204, he also told the US Congress that in 2020, Boeing had used wrong shortcuts in fit-up force and one-up assembly, two things for early delivery, due to which the fuses, which are the fuse leg gaps, may have problems in them.  They might be under stress. Because the force that is being used to make these right now is many times more than the force that Boeing is using. As much as should be actually invested. He even said that all these things that Boeing currently tells its workers about how to work are totally against the standards. He also accused the workers of jumping on the parts like Tarzan of the plane, which is not the way to work. This can increase the gaps on any plane or aircraft.  When Sam had raised serious concerns with Boeing, he had raised it even when he was working there because he had become a whistle blower. After this, he said that Boeing always ignored his serious concerns and harassed him. After this, Boeing shifted him from 787 to Triple 7, which is Triple 7, to the program of that flat.  I was asked to keep quiet and was threatened. Sam also told all these things. Here he also said that there is no safety culture at all in Boeing.  Whistle bearers are those who raise any voice, if any apple sees something wrong then it is suppressed.  So all these things raise questions about Boeing. Also there is a Robert, a Whistle Broker named Robert.  He also raised similar concerns against Boeing. Well, let's talk about India. Many questions are now being raised about Air India in India. People are saying a lot of things on social media. But among these, one such allegation or let us say a serious concern was raised. Gaurav Taneja has also been a former Uber pilot.  He posted a serious concern about X on Twitter.  After which this concern also came up in media reports. Meaning, it was also shown by many media channels.  Good proper newspapers published it. Basically Gaurav Taneja said what he wrote in his post.  He said serious flight safety concerns were raised against Air Asia in May 2020. In the DGCA investigation, safety violations were detected and two top officials, including Air Asia's then head of operations, Captain Manish Upal, were suspended.  If we look at the reports, this thing also comes to light.  It is also clearly published in the reports of that time of 2020.  But instead of fixing the safety issues, the airline fired the whistleblower who raised his voice. As far as Taneja is concerned, he is talking about himself here. And now Air Asia, at this time when the merger of Air Asia Vistara and Air India happened, when all of these were merged. After this, the same Captain Manishpal is made the Senior Vice President of Flight Operations of Air India.  So in this way, indirectly, the reinstatement of Manish Ul was done, after suspending him from this position, he was made the Senior Vice President of Flight Operations of Air India and after that, such things have happened in Air India itself.  Along with this, many times videos come out that the AC is not working in the flight.   In fact, ever since this crash happened, many videos are continuously coming out. AC does not work in many flights.   The cabin crew, the crew members do not come forward to talk.   He is not coming even when called.  People and passengers had to face a lot of difficulties. So all these things are constantly coming to light.  Well, basically the question friends is where did the mistake go?  Whose was it?  And what exactly happened in those moments?  And all this will come out.  This investigation has started because a black box has been found from the roof top of the building at the crash site.  The double AIB team, the airport investigation bureau and a team of about 40 people from the Gujarat government were monitoring there. Just yesterday, i.e. on the 13th, at around 5:30 pm, 40 of those officers recovered this black box.  The DGC will now continuously analyse its recordings. After this, investigation of the second black box is also going on continuously. He was at the front of the aircraft.  What is a black box basically ?  This is a very common question that people ask a lot of times.  There are many people who do not know about this. Then later they go and see.  You guys know, it's a very good thing.  But the black box is basically a device that records flight data. Whether the plane crashes, catches fire or the plane is in water, it can withstand the water pressure.  It never causes any harm to it.  It was created by an Australian scientist, David Boren. It was invented by them. And the black box basically has two parts. This is the main thing.  This is where the whole game is.  It has two parts.  The first is called the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).  The CVR keeps recording the conversations between the pilots and the sounds in the cockpit. And Flight Data Recorder (FDR) these are basically more than 80 such parameters which it monitors.  But mainly it includes details of altitude, air speed and heading.  Whatever these things are there in an airplane, he keeps saving all of these.  By now you all must have understood how this will help in the investigation but still let it be told.  The CVR keeps recording the pilot's conversation and engine sounds. So it will be seen there what happened in the last moments inside that plane, within those one or two minutes.  The second thing is FDR which keeps track of 80 plus parameters like altitude, air speed, pitch, all of which we just told you about. So from here also it will be seen what happened with the main plane from the time it crashed till the impact. Now this data is still being analyzed. You all know.  Usually it takes 20 days to one month.  It has been seen in many old cases of plane crashes, and even in missing planes, it has often been seen that if the black box is found somewhere, then it takes time to investigate it. Usually it may take around 20 to 1 month. But now, friends, only this black box will be able to tell us the real reason behind the med call or warnings of the Ahmedabad plane crash and will be able to clarify why the plane crashed after take-off. So friends, today's episode was very scary.  Whatever things I have seen in these two days were painful.  It was going to make you cry.   There were around 242 people in that plane. After that, in the hostel, where the people were eating food.  Plates are kept in the mess. Food has been served in them and is lying there in the same condition. Things have been ruined from here to there.  Many kids who were doctors, post graduates, PG medical students, their families also lived there.  Wife, kids, maid and the situation are such that after seeing it you wonder for once why did this happen? How did it happen, why, why was it necessary to happen, so it was a very horrific, painful plane crush and what possibilities do you think about it, do tell us in the comment section, it took a day to bring this video but we personally wanted that in this video for you, all the combined events should be brought, there should not be any news segment video that just the news came and told you that thing, and secondly, in this you people were also continuously watching its updates.  So please share this video.  Please comment on this.   Please tell us something that can reach the most number of people and secondly, if you are on Telegram or Instagram, then come and connect there.  We have a group there and a channel on Telegram.  You can join him there. You can also follow us on Instagram as well. We will talk there. Now we will meet in the next episode.  Please give me permission till then.  Hello.  Thank you.   Hail India.
