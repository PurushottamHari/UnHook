There is a tribe living in our Banaras which has been surviving by burning dead bodies for the last 3000 years. But here I experienced even more surprising things. A Holi which is played with the ashes of the dead. How more than 100 pyres are lit every day at this ghat. How one tribe is trying to save the same river that is slowly killing them.  And much more.  This is Banaras.  A city which apart from being divine is also facing many challenges today. Good Morning.  It is 4:00 in the morning. We have just reached here and as soon as we reached there my heart became scared because right in front of me the pyres are burning even at 4:00 in the morning.  It is believed here that 6000 years ago Lord Shiva cursed the entire Dom tribe.  When a member of this tribe committed the crime of stealing the earrings of Goddess Parvati. And right here on this ghat in Varanasi he is atoning for this curse even today.  But due to his atonement for so many years, today he has also received a boon that by the fire given by him and only by him, any human being can attain salvation.  We are the ones who are heaven.  You are the one who gives salvation. Yes, that is it.  Our business is to hunt down the Dom's leopard.  The burning of the Cheetah is the throne of the Dom king. From there we light the fire. This is our work.  How old were you when you started working?  Was 18 years old. You told me that your childhood was also spent here.  My father used to come and give me food. What is your name?  sunny.  Do you remember when you first set Sita on fire? First of all I thought how should I apply it. How can I go into the fire?  So, I have many uncles and all the workers here. Those people helped me. Right now I can see different parts of different bodies burning in front of me. Some have their head, some have their legs, some have their hands and it is not easy to see them.  You take money from life, we take it from death.  We earn our religion through death.  Yes, we earn from death.  The wood used to set the pyre on fire is also purchased from the ghat. Then the eldest descendant of the family sets fire to this wood.  the name of Ram is the truth.  the name of Ram is the truth.  I know that I am the only girl here among so many people and I also know that the presence of a girl at the cremation ground is not considered auspicious.  So the feeling of being here and telling these stories is very different and very deep right now.  What is the importance of Dom community and what is the need for the work that Doms do?  We will not do it. Who will do this?  The dead body will not come to the crematorium.   There is no Dome there.  It is not going to burn.  This is the head quarter of Domes where this fire is lit and from this fire all the pyres are lit. And this fire never goes off.   The first fire that ignites the pyre is from here, yes, it is taken from here.  And who keeps it burning?  Dom King.  Dom King. What problems arise?  Tell me a little about it.  It seems that it is summer now and there is no shade here but even in that the people of our society serve everyone. How long does it take for the body to burn ?  One and a half to two hours at least, and if the person is unwell and you are taking medicine, then sometimes it takes three to four hours also. And what do people think about the Dom community?   Is there ever any talk of high and low? After coming here you can say that this is the place of salvation.  the name of Ram is the truth.  So there is nothing left after that. Understanding death and talking about it is not easy.  But this city is a little different. And perhaps the biggest example of this is the Holi played here, Masaan Holi. While the whole world is afraid of death, here death is celebrated. [Music] Har Har Mahadev Har Har Mahadev Do come to play Holi once in your life. Once in a lifetime experience. Do come once to feel it. Another festival as colourful as the Holi of Masaan.

Using code KK Create A DOM worker's work is not an everyday thing.  Work 24 hours a day for 10 days and then no work for 10 days.  So these days, he works on sifting bones.  Meaning, by putting ash and burnt bones in the water, they sort it out and look for small pieces of gold and silver. But for this city, there is something more valuable than gold and silver. This river Mother Ganga flows ahead of this ghat. Many people also do the work of extracting coins from this Ganga Maiya and their story is perhaps the most connected with this river.  This is Sonu, he stays in water for 5 hours every day since the age of 10.  Holding your breath for 10 minutes at a depth of 60 feet is not easy.  When someone drowns, these people rescue him and bring him home.  Like people are drowning and we are wearing clothes.  The mobile is there, the purse is there, every penny gets wasted, and in an attempt to save it if it catches hold of us then we have to drink two, four, six, eight sips of water as well.  He is drinking.  If it climbs on us then we also have to drink water.  And he has to be rescued.   Have there ever been any people with you who went to rescue someone or dived down.   We have gone very low and then if we come back like this then many accidents happen.  Got trapped and died. For these coin divers called Gangaputra, this river is no less than a mother. This river is the life of Banaras.  But today, it looks something like this. Meaning, the very river that we worship, we then prepare to bury it alive. But the people here, despite their innocence, still consider Mother Ganga as sacred.  Pick up its water and drink it.  See how it looks. Look, we drink water. Okay, you drink water. More than 30 lakh people visit this holy land of Varanasi every year. But the responsibility of rotating them is that of just one community. Boatsman of Varanasi also known as Malha. How old is this boat?  This is 15 years old.  How long have you been driving now?  I was born in a boatman 's family.  what is your name sir? Vijay my name is Manish Kumar.  Manish Kumar ji, since when have you been rowing a boat?  Now the first time we drove it, my friend was 20 years old at that time.   The same 12 year old.  Was 12 years old.  Is rowing a boat a hard job?  Why isn't there hard work?  A lump falls on the hand.  My hand starts hurting in the evening.  Be it sunshine or rain, whatever happens, we have to do it. Your children?  There are two children.   do you study?  I did not study, I left it a bit, both of them were doing water work, it was so hard work that I left it and ran away to work at higher positions.   It is hard work.  It is a very hard work. After spending their whole life pursuing something, when people come to know that it was all just a game.  Then they come to this city. In this place you don't just see life and death.  You feel it as well.  The people here show the path of death to the entire world.  Once I saw a pyre burning in fire, I just kept looking at it. Maybe one day we'll all come here
