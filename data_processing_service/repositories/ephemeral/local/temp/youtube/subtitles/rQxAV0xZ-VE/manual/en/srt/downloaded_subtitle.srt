1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,440
There is a tribe living in our Banaras

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,880
which has been surviving by burning dead bodies for the last 3000 years.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,679
But here I

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,240
experienced even more surprising things.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,880
A Holi which is played with the ashes of the dead.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,920
How more than 100 pyres are lit every day at this ghat.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,160
How one tribe is

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,560
trying to save the same river that is

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,240
slowly killing them.  And

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,119
much more.  This is Banaras.  A city which

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,239
apart from being divine is also facing many challenges today.

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,239
Good Morning.  It is 4:00 in the morning.

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
We have just reached here

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,120
and as soon as we reached there my heart became scared

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,480
because right in front of me the

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,440
pyres are burning even at 4:00 in the morning.  It is

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,399
believed here that 6000 years ago Lord Shiva

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,480
cursed the entire Dom tribe.  When

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,399
a member of this tribe

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,359
committed the crime of stealing the earrings of Goddess Parvati.

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,840
And right here on this ghat in Varanasi he is

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,080
atoning for this curse even today.  But

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,640
due to his atonement for so many years, today

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,240
he has also received a boon that

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,320
by the fire given by him and only by him, any human being

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,479
can attain salvation.  We are the ones who

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,000
are heaven.  You are the one who gives salvation.

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,240
Yes, that is it.  Our business is to hunt down the Dom's

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
leopard.  The burning of the Cheetah is the throne of the Dom king.

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,320
From there we light the fire.

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,960
This is our work.  How old were you

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,040
when you started working?  Was 18 years old.

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,200
You told me that your childhood was also spent here.  My

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,439
father used to come and give me food.

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
What is your name?  sunny.  Do you remember when

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,079
you first set Sita on fire?

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,479
First of all I thought how should I apply it.

38
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,400
How can I go into the fire?  So, I have

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,880
many uncles and all the workers here.

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,040
Those people helped me.

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Right now I can see different parts of different bodies burning in front of me.

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,280
Some have their

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,840
head, some have their legs, some have their hands and it is

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
not easy to see them.  You take money from life,

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,159
we take it from death.  We

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
earn our religion through death.  Yes, we earn

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,640
from death.  The wood used to set the pyre on fire is

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,840
also purchased from the ghat.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,200
Then the eldest descendant of the family sets fire to this wood.  the

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,640

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,720
name of Ram is the truth.  the name of Ram is the truth.  I know

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
that I

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,480
am the only girl here among so many people and I also

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,879
know that the presence of a girl at the cremation ground is

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,160
not considered auspicious.  So the feeling of being here and

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,800
telling these stories is

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,840
very different and very deep right now.  What

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,599
is the importance of Dom community and

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
what is the need for the work that Doms do?  We will not do it.

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,160
Who will do this?  The dead body will not come to the crematorium.   There

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,640
is no Dome there.  It is not going to burn.  This

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,519
is the head quarter of Domes where this fire is

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,760
lit and from this fire all the pyres are lit.

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,920
And this fire never goes off.   The

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,879
first fire that ignites the pyre is from here,

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,040
yes, it is taken from here.  And

67
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,040
who keeps it burning?  Dom King.  Dom King.

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,800
What problems arise?  Tell me a little

69
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,840
about it.  It seems that it is

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,560
summer now and there is no shade here but

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,480
even in that the people of our society serve everyone.

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
How long does it take for the body to burn

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,480
?  One and a half to two hours at least, and if the

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,879
person is unwell and you are taking medicine, then

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,840
sometimes it takes three to four hours also.

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,000
And

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,879
what do people think about the Dom community?   Is there

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,440
ever any talk of high and low?

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,879
After coming here you can say that this is the place of salvation.  the name of Ram

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,480
is the truth.  So there is nothing left after that.

81
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:42,920
Understanding death and talking about it is

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:46,319
not easy.  But this city is a little different.

83
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:50,480
And perhaps the biggest example of this is the

84
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,280
Holi played here, Masaan Holi.

85
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,940
While the whole world is afraid of death,

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:09,920
here death is celebrated.

87
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:11,159
[Music]

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,319
Har

89
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,639
Har

90
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,120
Mahadev Har

91
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,240
Har Mahadev Do come to play Holi once in your life. Once in a

92
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,560
lifetime

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,400
experience. Do come once to feel it.

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,120

95
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,680
Another festival as colourful as the Holi of Masaan.

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
I recently attended Unacademy Manzil

97
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,160
where after meeting more than 50 IAS IPS

98
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
officers, I came to know that

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,680
a single decision of the bureaucracy can change the lives of millions of people.

100
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,160
Similarly, in 2024, more than 80

101
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,800
UPSC toppers have made

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
their dreams come true with the guidance of Unacademy.  Here

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,320

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,560
student of Mrinal sir.  Now

109
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,240
 

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,160

click on the link in the description below and

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,520
start your UPSC journey.  Using

116
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,080
code KK Create A DOM worker's work is not an

117
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,240
everyday thing.  Work 24 hours a day for 10 days and then

118
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,240
no work for 10 days.  So these days, he

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
works on sifting bones.  Meaning, by

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,240
putting ash and burnt bones in the water, they

121
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,960
sort it out and look for small pieces of gold and silver.

122
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,039
 

123
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,600
But for this city, there is something more valuable than gold and silver.

124
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,960

125
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,600
This river Mother Ganga flows ahead of this ghat.

126
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,000
Many people also do the work of extracting coins from this Ganga Maiya

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,199
and their story is perhaps

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the most connected with this river.  This is Sonu, he

129
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,680
stays in water for 5 hours

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,800
every day since the age of 10.  Holding your breath for 10 minutes at a depth of 60 feet is

131
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,759
not easy.  When someone drowns,

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,520
these people rescue him and bring him home.  Like people are

133
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,840
drowning and we are wearing clothes.  The

134
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,000
mobile is there, the purse is there, every penny gets

135
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,919
wasted, and in an attempt to save it if

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
it catches hold of us then we have to drink two, four,

137
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,560
six, eight sips of water as well.  He is

138
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
drinking.  If it climbs on us then we also have to

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,960
drink water.  And he has to be rescued.   Have there

140
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,360
ever been any people with you who went to

141
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,199
rescue someone or dived down.   We have

142
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,960
gone very low and then if we come back like this then many

143
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,960
accidents happen.  Got trapped and died.

144
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,520

145
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,319
For these coin divers called Gangaputra, this river is no less than a mother.

146
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,319
This river is the life of Banaras.  But today, it looks something like this.

147
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,120
Meaning, the very river that we worship, we then

148
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,560
prepare to bury it alive.

149
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,680
But the people here, despite their innocence,

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,440
still consider Mother Ganga as sacred.  Pick up its water

151
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
and drink it.  See how it looks.

152
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,599
Look, we drink water.

153
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,720
Okay, you drink water.

154
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,280
More than 30 lakh people visit this holy land of Varanasi every year.

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,240
But the responsibility of rotating them is that

156
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,120
of just one community.

157
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,880
Boatsman of Varanasi also known as Malha.

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,520
 

159
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,680
How old is this boat?  This is 15 years

160
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,680
old.  How long have you been

161
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,039
driving now?  I was born in a boatman

162
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,520
's family.  what is your name sir?

163
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,080
Vijay my name is Manish Kumar.  Manish Kumar

164
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,880
ji, since when have you been rowing a boat?  Now the first

165
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,000
time we drove it, my friend was 20 years old at that time.   The

166
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,240
same 12 year old.  Was 12 years old.  Is

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,199
rowing a boat a hard job?  Why isn't there hard work?  A

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
lump falls on the hand.  My hand

169
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,560
starts hurting in the evening.  Be it sunshine or

170
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,360
rain, whatever happens, we have to do it.

171
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,160
Your children?  There are two children.   do you

172
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,360
study?  I did not study, I left it a bit,

173
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,840
both of them were doing water work, it was so hard work that I

174
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,639
left it and ran away to work at higher positions.   It

175
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,639
is hard work.  It is a very hard work.

176
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,160

177
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,960
After spending their whole life pursuing something, when people come to know that

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,680
it was all just a game.  Then they come to this city.

179
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,919
In this place you don't just see life and death.  You

180
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,879
feel it as well.  The

181
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,599
people here

182
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,960
show the path of death to the entire world.  Once I saw a pyre

183
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:35,519
burning in fire, I just kept looking at it.

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,519
Maybe one day we'll all come here
