00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
Today we are talking journals and

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,040
managing your life with pen and paper.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,720
Hi, I'm Lauren Valdez. I am Thiago's

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,120
wife. I'm also the co-founder of Forte

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,519
Labs. When I first started doing this

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,599
productivity stuff with Thiago, I kept

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,840
trying to copy Thiago's system and it

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
kept failing. And it wasn't until I I

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
learned like, oh, this doesn't work for

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,680
me because it's not the way I work. I am

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,600
not Thiago. And I started making systems

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,439
in a way that worked for my brain and

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,279
the way I process. That's when I could

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
really customize systems that actually

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
stuck and I could actually develop

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
habits. And that's what I want to leave

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,640
you with. So, I'm going to show you all

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,960
my systems of how I manage things in my

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,960
second brain, which is my notebooks.

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,680
Man, I really hate the word

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
productivity. It has this connotation of

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,280
like driving and machines and getting

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
things done fast and efficiently and

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,199
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. I

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,120
actually think about productivity in a

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,680
way about being intentional. Doing

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,559
things with pen and paper is how I slow

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,039
down to be more intentional and reflect

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,119
more on my life to make sure that I am

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,280
not just doing things to do things, but

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,520
that the things I'm doing are really

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,240
aligned with who I am and the kind of

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,240
life I want to live.

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,439
I have two productivity principles I

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,799
live by. The first one is what is simple

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,439
is sustainable. I try to keep my systems

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,200
as simple as possible so I don't burn

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,720
out, so I don't lose things, so I'm not

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
wasting time trying to figure out how to

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,960
use a new digital tool. This is why I do

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
everything by pen and paper. It is just

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,920
simple. My second productivity principle

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,079
is what is pleasurable is motivating. It

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
is so pleasurable for me to sit and

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
write with my pretty pens and my

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,920
journals and go outside and feel all

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,759
peaceful. I love it. I crave it. So, I

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
make time for it. Whereas sitting in

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,560
front of my computer with my calendar

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,159
and my task manager and all that stuff,

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
that's not pleasurable for me. That

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,640
makes me feel like uh why am I doing

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,439
this? And that was the reason my digital

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,280
systems regularly broke down. And once I

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,280
moved to pen and paper, I realized that

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,200
it was a lot more pleasurable for me.

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,119
[Music]

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,720
So, for all of you nerdy folks out

59
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
there, there is a ton of literature and

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,319
evidence out there on why writing by

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,319
hand fires up more synapses and

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,920
connections in your brain. And you draw

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,599
on more memories when you're writing by

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
hand and you form more memories when

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,080
you're writing by hand than when you are

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,040
typewriting. But for me, writing by hand

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
is really about slowing down. I am the

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
kind of person who has a really hard

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,519
time saying no to things. And it's so

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
easy when you have digital task managers

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
to just like say yes to things, grab an

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
email, copy and paste everything into

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
your task manager. And I want to make

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,519
the point that it's not about paper

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,640
versus digital. It's knowing when it's

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,480
best for me to use a tool that's digital

77
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,239
or writing by pen and paper. There are a

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,480
couple other reasons personally why I

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,519
like to do things by hand as much as

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,440
possible. Me and my digital life, we got

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,280
issues. Like I don't know if it's my

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,519
psychic frequencies in the world that

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,920
make technology break down in my hands,

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,000
but I cannot even tell you how often I

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,239
am trying to do something really basic

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
and like my Bluetooth is not connecting,

87
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,159
the app's freezing that it just it feels

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
like there's often a lot of friction.

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,760
And when you just get out a piece of

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,840
paper and a pen, it's like there is no

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,080
friction. You just go and do what you

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,080
need to do.

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
Oo, I got so many notebooks. And I

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,040
didn't even bring all of them. Here I

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,599
have my uh my cheap CVS grocery store

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,799
school notebooks that I use for my brain

97
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,519
dump morning pages. Then I have my

98
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,920
official bullet journal that comes from

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,799
writer Carol's bullet journal method.

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,480
This is what I use for my task manager

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,080
and taking notes throughout the day

102
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
during meetings and things like that.

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,760
Then I have my weekly review journal and

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,920
this is where I kind of big picture look

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,560
at the week and I put these little

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,720
stickers of photos and it's kind of like

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,879
my memories of the highs and lows of the

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,560
week. And then I have what I call my

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,360
spell book. I know it's very hocus

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,480
pocus. It's where I do my annual review

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,879
and I I joke that it's for manifesting

112
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,639
but really um it's my goal setting

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,199
notebook. And these notebooks

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,840
essentially correspond to my daily,

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,360
weekly, monthly, and annual reviews. So

116
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,120
these are my four notebooks. And I'm

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,479
going to take you through my practices

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,479
for how I use these notebooks.

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm going to start by showing you my

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,960
daily review practice and what that

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,880
looks like. Starting out with my morning

122
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
pages journaling. If you're familiar

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
with morning pages, the practice, it

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,199
comes from Julia Cameron's book, The

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,199
Artist Way. For me, what this looks like

126
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,520
is I write super super fast in like 15

127
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,400
minutes to just get out all the gunk

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,440
that is in my brain so that I can be

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,520
present to my day. There really is no

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,600
prompt for this, but I am someone who

131
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,440
struggles with a lot of anxiety. Like,

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,199
I'm always replaying what just happened

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
yesterday and what I said that was dumb

134
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,160
and whatever. And normally in writing

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,919
that out, I see the absurdity of my

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,759
thoughts and I'm able to get distance

137
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,720
from them and make peace with my

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,120
feelings. But I'm often surprised by

139
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,039
what comes out in my journaling. Like

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
sometimes there is emotion that comes

141
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,639
out that I didn't even know I was

142
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,360
feeling and I just lay it all out on the

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,759
page. I see this as my space to say

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,600
things that I would never say aloud.

145
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
Like my judgments about myself and

146
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,720
others, my long rants and complaints

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
about me and the world or my husband or

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
whatever. Like I do something I call

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,639
rage writing where I just like rage on

150
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
the page. I highly recommend it. It's

151
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,919
really great. I wish I was like Thiago.

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
Like I wish I could just like sit down

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,919
and like go through my checklist and and

154
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,639
work, but that's not how I am. I have to

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,240
process my feelings first before I can

156
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,240
sit down and really work.

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
Next, I'm going to show you my task

158
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
management system, which I do following

159
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,240
writer Carol's bullet journal method.

160
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,680
Ryder is someone who's a friend, and I

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,600
know that he lives and breathes

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
intentionality in his life. I'm actually

163
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,520
like such a fan of his that Thiago's a

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,240
little bit jealous. Time can't be made,

165
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,600
it could only be taken, it can be taken

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,759
from us or it can be taken by us. And

167
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,840
that to me really encapsulates the

168
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,880
purpose of a bullet journal. It's not

169
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,160
just a tasks manager. It's really about

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,080
making time to think about what you want

171
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,919
to bring in into your life. What are you

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,600
saying yes to? Um, and probably the most

173
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,759
important thing about a bullet journal

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,000
is you have to update it and you have to

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,240
roll over manually your task by

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,039
rewriting out the task. If I am feeling

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
resistance to rewriting a task from

178
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,199
yesterday or last week over into a new

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,440
week, that makes me pause and really

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,560
think, do I want to be doing this in my

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,400
life? And it's funny how easy it is to

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
default to this passive mode of just

183
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,680
like doing something because you can and

184
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,039
maybe because you want to. But when I do

185
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,039
it this way by hand, I really have to

186
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,720
challenge myself. And I might roll over

187
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,080
a task like three or four times before I

188
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,319
realize, actually, Lauren, you don't

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,400
want to do this. and I make peace. I go

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,840
back to my morning uh pages and I make

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,280
peace with the task that I don't want to

192
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,039
do. Another thing I've noticed of moving

193
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,160
to doing these things physically versus

194
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,919
digitally, it is so easy to use an app

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
to track something like your coffee or

196
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,759
your sleep or to do a quick capture like

197
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,400
voice note or you know tell your Siri to

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,639
remind you about X Y and Z. But I

199
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,599
noticed that anytime I pick up my phone

200
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,680
for any reason, nine times out of 10 I

201
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,039
will start checking my notifications. 20

202
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
minutes have gone by and I don't

203
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,919
remember why I picked up my phone in the

204
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
first place. Um, and there's something

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,039
super gratifying about crossing off

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
something on your to-do list when it's

207
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,039
on paper. I I just don't feel that when

208
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,360
I check the little box on my task

209
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,199
manager um digitally, but it feels

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,850
really good to do it with a pen and

211
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,599
paper.

212

[Music]

213
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,639
This is my weekly review journal. It's a

214
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,479
pretty simple practice. I review my

215
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
photos from the past week and I pick out

216
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,919
my favorite two to three. I print them

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,199
on this little printer. And then I just

218
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,039
write out here's what happened this

219
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,800
week, the good and the challenging and

220
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,360
the lessons learned. I keep this pretty

221
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
quick and pretty messy. My writing is is

222
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,479
hard to read. I don't overthink it. I

223
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
don't try to make it fancy. I just try

224
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,240
to make sure I get it done. Also, I'm

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
not very rigid about any of these

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,520
practices. If I miss them, it's okay.

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,279
It's not the end of the world. And I

228
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,440
love having this boundary of only taking

229
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,080
one page because then I don't I don't

230
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,680
overdo it. I keep things very concise.

231

[Music]

232
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,279
This is my spell book. It's very big and

233
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,040
I only use it for what I call my moon

234
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,560
ritual and my annual reviews. And it has

235
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
like the chakras on it. So, it just

236
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
feels like more embodied, more

237
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,800
spiritual. When I use this, I get out

238
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,800
handles. I have a special reflective

239
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,360
playlist. So, I have fun with this. I

240
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,959
call it LV's book of spells. Um, my kids

241
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
have found it and colored on it a little

242
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,040
bit. And this is my book for I call it

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
manifesting. Someone else might call it

244
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,920
goal setting, but um I've never really

245
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,600
resonated with the idea of setting

246
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
goals. I like to do things in a way

247
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,080
that's more about setting an intention.

248
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,320
And an intention for me is distinctive

249
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,320
from a goal in that it's more about the

250
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,480
way I want to be, the way I want to

251
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,720
feel, like what I want to like create

252
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,720
rather than like here's this thing I'm

253
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
going to do which feels like separate

254
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
than me. I feel like goals are almost

255
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,240
like external, right? Mine is more like

256
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
and my intentions are more like

257
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,040
internal, more about me and how I feel

258
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
than about like what I accomplish.

259
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,680
Similarly to my breakdown with the

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,720
weekly reviews, I really struggled with

261
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,880
a monthly review process as defined in

262
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
the getting things done method or the

263
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,600
way Thiago defines it in building a

264
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,880
second brain. My monthly reviews finally

265
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,160
stuck when um I had a cousin who started

266
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,519
leading these new moon circles. For me,

267
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,240
doing a ritual every new moon, every new

268
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,560
moon cycle, so every 28 days, I feel

269
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,120
like I get a fresh start. I reflect on

270
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,480
the past moon cycle, the past 28 days,

271
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
um I look at my photos, I look at my

272
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,079
calendar, I'm like, what happened that

273
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,320
were like the highlights? What were the

274
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,320
challenging moments that I survived?

275
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
What were the lessons I learned? What do

276
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
I want to let go of from this past moon

277
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
cycle? And then I think about, well,

278
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
what do I want to create in my life? And

279
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,360
I set an intention for the new moon. And

280
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,200
then every full moon, it's a time I

281
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
reflect and I reflect on how I'm doing

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,279
on that intention. And I have some

283
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,880
prompts that really guide me to think

284
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,040
about like what is actually fulfilling

285
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,440
in my life and what is not fulfilling.

286
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,079
What I love about all this journaling I

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,839
do is that it keeps things better in my

288
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,079
memory and in my brain. like I don't

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,720
always have to go back and like review

290
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,200
my notes because I wrote them by hand. I

291
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,800
am more likely to recall what I wrote or

292
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,760
what I thought. So every year on my

293
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,320
birthday, I do a ritual where I reflect

294
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,680
on the past year and my age and what I'm

295
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,839
grateful for and what I want to let go

296
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,560
of and what I want to call in. And I can

297
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,800
do that practice in like an hour or two

298
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,120
because I can just flip through my moon

299
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,720
rituals and quickly glance. Here's what

300
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
happened in the past year. Here's how I

301
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
grew. Here were the lessons I've

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
learned.

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
If you want to get started with the

304
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
journaling practice and you feel a

305
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,399
little overwhelmed by everything I

306
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,720
shared, um, keep in mind the two

307
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,959
productivity principles that I live by.

308
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,519
One, what is simple is sustainable.

309
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,760
Start with what is simple. Maybe that's

310
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,320
one notebook and maybe you set a timer

311
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,320
for 15 minutes. The second principle is

312
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
to just keep it pleasurable. Like it

313
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
should feel good. You should crave it.

314
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,440
If it doesn't feel that way for you,

315
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
then maybe it's not for you. Or maybe

316
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,480
you need to figure out ways to make it

317
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,880
more fun and enjoyable for you like the

318
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,959
way I have my sticker printer or finding

319
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,040
beautiful journals or pack your journal

320
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,040
in a bag as you go on a hike and then

321
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
sit out in nature and journal. Like find

322
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,000
the ways that are going to make it

323
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
pleasurable for you so that you crave

324
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
it. You want to do it. You want to

325
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,279
incorporate it in your life. If you are

326
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,519
trying to start any kind of habit, stay

327
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,440
flexible with yourself. I skip

328
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
journaling sessions all the time and

329
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,680
that's fine. I know that I will come

330
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,440
back to it. And maybe that might be a

331
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,600
few days, maybe that's a few weeks, but

332
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,760
I will come back to it at some point

333
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,320
because I will start losing my if I

334
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,320
don't come back to it.

335
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,320
If you want to learn more about these

336
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,800
kinds of practices and and using more

337
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
embodied tools with your productivity,

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,360

journaling sessions as well as some new

345
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,430
moon and full moon ritual journaling

346
