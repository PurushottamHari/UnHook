1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
Thank you so much Bhaves. I have been

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,520
looking forward to this conversation

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,240
probably since I saw your first video on

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,639
Instagram. Very grateful. I'll tell you

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,440
why also

6
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:16,760
because tell me if my understanding is

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:20,160
accurate. I think the spiritual corpus

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,240
literature the the religious tradition

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,359
and ritual and deities and all this sort

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,519
of history that we come

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,840
from may not necessarily be a literal

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,279
history. M I think the video I saw of

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,480
you because it's been a few years was

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,920
about either Ma Kali or it was about

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,160
Shiv Shankar Maharaj and the way you had

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
framed how to interpret them was very

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
like I could touch it. I could feel it.

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,200
It's not some distant deity. It was an

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,680
understanding of the world that you'd

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,920
offered through that symbol. Is that an

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,079
accurate way of understanding?

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,320
True. Because the fact is whenever you

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,000
read something uh what is written by the

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,280
rishies and what you interpret is

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
something very different. Right.

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
However, when you experience it and you

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,399
talk on your basis of that experience,

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,479
you will realize that what was written

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,920
is true. So when you talk about daties

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,320
or talk about anything, it is actually

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,000
happening. So I think an above talks,

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,960
experience talks. So you were saying

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,280
that your life experience becomes easier

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,759
to understand using that symbol.

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
Intellectually no. Experientially yes.

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
So first it starts with intellect that

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,600
suppose we see Kalima holding something.

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,960
It is intellect that she'll do this. But

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,880
once you actually experience it, you

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,880
will relate it. And how does one

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,880
experience this? The best way to

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,560
experience is work on the ego.

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,119
Understand there's a greater energy that

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
is working and work on the path. Walking

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
on the path is like have discipline do

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,640
sadena and knowledge is very important.

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
Without knowledge nothing can happen.

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
But excess of knowledge is also a

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,799
problem because it'll become an

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,799
obstacle. Yeah. So knowledge plus

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,200
experience is wisdom. That is what we

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,240
need and especially for our generation

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,320
because we need evidence. We need logic

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,439
mind and I think spiritual is very

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,200
logical and experiential not fearing. I

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,960
so I was giving you this background

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,960
about myself before. Um I think my most

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
unpoluted direct access into the

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,959
spiritual world comes from my experience

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
with vipashana right um the first time

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,480
around I went as a silence challenge.

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,640
But God deals you what he wants to deal

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,239
you not what you ask right definitely.

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,239
So I am in there saying can I stay

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,400
silent for 10 days and like can I be

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,280
alone for 10 days but what is happening

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,360
inside of me is magic is waves is

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,879
bubbles bursting and like good and bad

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
painful and sad right all of that is

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,879
happening and I realize because Goena G

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,200
insists Genka G plays on a video because

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,200
he's since passed and he talks about the

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,040
experience you're having every day and

74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
he will say listen do not try to

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
intellectualize this don't ask me

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
questions about philosophy true I'm from

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
a philosophy background I'm offended

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
He's saying this he's like only

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,040
experience and so day one I'm like what

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,959
are you talking about don't talk about

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,879
philosophy day two I'm like what are you

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
talking about don't talk and slowly I'm

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,239
getting milder are sir what are you

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,920
saying till the day six comes and I'm

85
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
like no no no experience is something

86
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,920
completely different definitely and my

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
education in the western cannon has not

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,400
prepared me for understanding experience

89
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,080
now I know that experience and intellect

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
are different inside how do you explain

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
it to somebody who does not see it is

92
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,879
very very simple no we are living in a

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,480
world of duality a active. Yes. Like

94
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,080
what do you mean duality? Duality means

95
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,000
wherever there is happiness there is

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
sorrow. Wherever there is gain there is

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,599
pain. Where is win there is loss also.

98
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,239
We are living in this world and no one

99
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,680
can run away from it. Fact. Even now at

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,040
this point of you have everything. Next

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,599
moment everything goes. No one knows

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,200
what is going to happen. Acceptance. So

103
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,640
you understand that life is like this.

104
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,959
Now what happens? This is a space of

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,720
intellect. Now when you understand

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,720
spirituality it is a space beyond

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,239
intellect. Experience is talking but

108
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,360
it's not written in any book. And more

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,040
than that every experience is unique. If

110
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
we both are doing meditating we won't

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,840
have the same experience. Agreed. Yeah.

112
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,360
Initially bubble yoga white light but

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,920
those are not experiences. Those are

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
just mind going to higher whatever it

115
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,560
is. Right. So everyone is unique. So

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,959
that is a space where your sadna starts.

117
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,040
So in the beginning it's all physical

118
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,159
all repetitive. But once and six days

119
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
you experience imagine you're

120
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,599
maintaining that for one year. You'll be

121
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,360
completely evolved. H and so the

122
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,199
experience is me actually doing

123
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,720
something and then from there a

124
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,359
consequence emerging which is completely

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,040
unique to me. Yeah. But beyond that also

126
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,160
there's a state that is a very high

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,240
state where you realize that

128
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
um I don't want to call it samadhi

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,880
because there are different types of

130
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
samadi and that's a new term but there

131
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,800
are states where you become a witness of

132
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
everything.

133
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,680
Witness of the happen stance of your

134
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,080
life. Yeah. M you participate. See who

135
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,639
was a yogi if you ask me I would believe

136
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,880
a yogi or a very evolving as a person

137
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
who has no expectations no desire no

138
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,960
attachment but complete participation in

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,479
the game of life

140
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,720
no attachment but complete participation

141
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,240
yeah that means he's also crying but at

142
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
the end deep inside he knows that okay

143
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,080
you know what crying is a performance

144
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,479
yeah is a performance right internally

145
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm not this right so I'm cooking okay

146
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,360
he's my relationship he's my brother but

147
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,280
at the one of the one of the days he's

148
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,759
going to die a temporary but internally

149
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,639
you're established I It's a very high

150
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:17,320
state of being. I then life becomes a

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:21,120
game as you said. H right actually

152
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,120
um my interaction with spirituality and

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
philosophy and such and the way I I

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
think actually everybody at the base of

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,520
their mind is philosophical. Everybody

156
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
has a operating system. This is my world

157
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
view that people say right and my

158
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
worldview comes from realizing this

159
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,479
vipashna opened up for me is that see

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,720
beyond all of what is happening inside

161
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,720
I'm just silently watching

162
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
and that door did not exist before that

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,240
I didn't know because otherwise I was

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
sad I was in the sadness I was sad I

165
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,039
don't want to be sad but then I realized

166
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,199
I could just step back and be like oh

167
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,520
sadness is happening yeah of course and

168
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
once that happened I think a lot of my

169
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,400
opinions about life changed and I was

170
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,960
like now if I'm playing a game I'm

171
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
playing win or lose whatever mind and

172
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,759
you're not judging your own game. You're

173
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,520
not getting entangled in your emotions.

174
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
You're watching it as a you know the

175
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,400
beautiful phrase that all these are

176
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,800
passing clouds. I'm the sky. Huh? So you

177
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
know all this is passing lust, anger,

178
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,039
desire. You are the sky. If you realize

179
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,800
then you watch the cloud going you

180
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,960
participate also in it but internally

181
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
you're not shaken up.

182
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,280
That is awareness. If you're aware about

183
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
your existence okay but we drop down

184
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,280
because it is difficult to maintain that

185
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,199
state and once you maintain that state

186
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,000
then you become a very highly evolved

187
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,440
walking being on earth right why is it

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
so difficult to maintain that state

189
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,080
because we have been conditioned no for

190
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
such a long

191
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,560
time vanta calls it name and form we are

192
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,800
so conditioned to give name and form to

193
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,479
everything that is a conditioning

194
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,039
we are just making you realize that okay

195
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,720
there's something beyond that also right

196
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,960
fair um I wanted to start my line of

197
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,759
questioning by asking you uh how do you

198
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,000
selfidentify do you think you are a

199
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:09,039
teacher uh mistake what I think I'm just

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,039
a small particle under Kali's feet that

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,880
is my guru shv and kali and of course my

202
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,720
guru also right very practically

203
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
speaking fair of course I'm in the body

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,759
when I talk to you okay bhavish is

205
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
talking I can't talk like oh kali is

206
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
talking people will throw me But

207
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,160
internally, yes, that awareness is

208
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,000
there. You are just a small particle,

209
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
just an instrument in her hands. In

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,919
Kali's hand, whatever she wants, she'll

211
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,919
do. Is there a purpose to this

212
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,840
instrument in Kali's hand? An instrument

213
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,680
has no purpose. No. The duty of the

214
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,479
instrument is to be fit, fine, active,

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,080
and be at service. Right? Whatever Kali

216
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,919
might. So, my duty is to look after my

217
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,199
body, be aware, do what she wants, and

218
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,960
that's about it. That's She does

219
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,720
everything. My dear, who's rising the

220
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,240
sun? Who's setting the moon? The sun and

221
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,840
the moon never set or rise, right? But

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,919
it is happening in this Maya. No, earth

223
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
is rotating. No, there's one energy. If

224
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,440
you understand the flow of that energy

225
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
and if you surrender completely, you

226
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
will realize that life is beautiful.

227
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
Everything is taken care of. Your

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
smallest needs are taken care of. H at

229
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,680
the same time, what is not required is

230
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,280
blocked by that energy only. So you call

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
it sh, you call it shaky, you call it

232
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,759
kali, you call it consciousness, you

233
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,720
call it anything.

234
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,440
Right?

235
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,080
Is there a philosophy you have? Is there

236
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
a intellectual thought you subscribe to?

237
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,199
What is your method? Let me put it like

238
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
that. My method of worship. Good

239
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,000
question.

240
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:31,080
Uh if you ask me as my guru says that

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,680
I'm a mixture of uh vdanta and

242
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,200
tantra. So I follow the philosophy and

243
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,479
in fact on the spiritual path everyone

244
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
follows this philosophy that we come

245
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,039
from the same source. But the worship

246
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,640
may be met different. Someone is into bi

247
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,560
to gas into cup. So I think I'm a

248
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
mixture of worshiping the gods also

249
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,800
understanding that they are formless.

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,560
That is my method and of course uh I

251
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,480
think when you evolve on the path you

252
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,959
realize that no matter what path you

253
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,399
take all are connected they all play an

254
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,920
equal role. Explain to me this uh path

255
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,680
choosing how does one choose a path or

256
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,519
is does the path choose you? Like how

257
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
does this play? There are many things

258
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,320
the path is actually determined based on

259
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,920
your past sanscaras and kmas the past

260
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,080
impressions that you're holding right

261
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,680
secondly I think the first step of the

262
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
path is to understand what makes you

263
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,200
happy

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,839
more than jumping into understand what

265
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
is giving you peace of mind h so basic

266
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,360
whenever someone is walking on the path

267
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,440
or getting into this without a guru or

268
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,920
without having start with asan pranayam

269
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,680
ashtanga gate limbs work on that nicely

270
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,240
automatically it will unfold and the

271
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,080
desire to know the unknown should be

272
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
And if you realize you talk to great

273
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,120
saints or anyone, the first thing is the

274
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,800
curiosity. It hits everyone. Everyone's

275
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
curious. Everyone, everyone's

276
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,760
curious. What will happen after these

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,760
all basic question? It's everyone. That

278
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,680
means already since you're born, you're

279
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,519
walking on the path. I think that's in

280
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
fact very profound coming from a

281
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,040
psychological philosophical point of

282
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,480
view. And this, you know, Hume famously

283
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
said all addictions are low-level

284
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,839
searches for God. True. Right. And if

285
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,320
you look at anything for that matter, um

286
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,560
men desiring physical connection, fe

287
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,279
females desiring emotional connection,

288
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,399
um people desiring substance, uh people

289
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,720
desiring success, glory, fame, all of

290
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,040
these are imaginations of

291
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,200
self-trcendence that I will be beyond me

292
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,200
once I have this. I will not I will

293
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,279
cease to be imprisoned by myself. And so

294
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,680
we keep chasing them to realize this is

295
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,760
not it. This is not it. This is not it.

296
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
And nati nati unfolds like this in your

297
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,000
life. Beautiful. That is we practice

298
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,839
every day nati. In fact I talk about

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
natrii it's mentioned inad also very

300
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,040
clearly. Now when you think suppose if

301
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
you are running behind a car yeah you

302
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,800
run you run you get a very fancy car you

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,399
get one of the top models or whatever

304
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,399
but nature is very amazing till the time

305
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,560
you get it there'll be 10,000 models out

306
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,959
there. Then again you want more. The

307
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,120
mind is like this. Yeah we call it the

308
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,120
monkey mind right? The mad monkey mind

309
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,360
who's drunk all the time right? It never

310
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,519
gets satisfied. No. So what I believe

311
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,920
and understand is when the mind is under

312
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,880
control, he's a best friend. When he's

313
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,040
not, it's your worst enemy. Right. Worst

314
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,040
in any relationship, worse than any

315
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,959
problem because constantly it will just

316
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,480
drag you into everything. Right. Right.

317
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,959
Right. Right. Right. So even the

318
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,240
mechanism of this wanting more, you

319
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,760
know, one can experience this. So

320
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,519
suppose somebody's like I want 2 lakh

321
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,920
rupees monthly salary then I will be

322
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,279
happy. You will probably for 6 months

323
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
then you'll start comparing yourself to

324
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,760
everybody else who has two lakhs and

325
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
then some more and then you want that

326
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,240
and it keeps sort of keeping you loop

327
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,920
like I wonder what happens between 20

328
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,920
and 60 in a person's life and it seems

329
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,600
like this is what happens many loops

330
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
same roller coaster this is the main

331
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,920
teaching you know when we talk about uh

332
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,800
dharum and earth the two goals of life

333
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,079
is all our needs are taken care of never

334
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,079
agreed we humans are so greedy we want

335
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,320
to take take if you realize and Look at

336
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,959
the world the small ant is also taken

337
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,560
care even to this big bird or sun or

338
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,120
everything that is happening but we just

339
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,320
want want and I've seen people wanting

340
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,519
also and after that they're not

341
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
satisfied because mentally they are

342
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,200
messed up completely why do you think

343
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,040
people don't realize that this wanting

344
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
is not going to cease why do you think I

345
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,959
don't realize forget the word need take

346
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,639
subject matter one like uh because I

347
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,200
want I was telling you earlier I have

348
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,839
material aspiration um I try to stay at

349
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,920
best playing this game enjoying this

350
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,760
game I even tell myself active ly when

351
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,600
the game's not going my way material

352
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,959
game. I enjoy this. Yeah. Because

353
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,320
tomorrow when it will, I'll be like,

354
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,720
"Oh, bro, this was such a bad time."

355
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,200
Now, you know, you you have this. Why

356
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
don't I, Himmanshu, the rest of us

357
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
realize that this is not going to solve

358
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,760
it? You tell me. How long would you play

359
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,279
the game? Until I'm bored. I think

360
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,200
boredom is a divine signal. How about

361
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,519
after that? What? Something else. See,

362
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,519
every game has a rule, right? If I ask

363
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,560
you if you're playing football, one

364
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
person is uh can run behind the ball but

365
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
there are 12 people running behind the

366
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
ball for no reason because that is the

367
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,720
rule of the game. If you're talking

368
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
about the game of life, have you

369
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
understood the rules and regulation of

370
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,360
the game of life? You'll never get bored

371
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,600
because you will master life. Yeah, you

372
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,680
become a victim of life. I'm bored. I

373
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
don't know what to do. I'll find

374
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,440
something else. You're not understanding

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
the game. And that game will bind you to

376
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,200
karma. And who will have to pay? You

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,560
will have to pay. But if you have

378
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
understood the game of life, you have

379
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,000
understood how the rules of life or how

380
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
nature works and that is the beauty of

381
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,680
human birth. Tell me about these rules

382
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,320
and regulations. It's a very interesting

383
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,920
phrase. There are no rules as such. The

384
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
rules are like of course there's law of

385
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,839
karma. Sure. Explain to me because I

386
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,680
want to understand your we talk about

387
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
the four goals of life. If you have

388
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
taken a human body, there are four goals

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
of life. I'm sure you might be aware

390
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,240
about it. That is dharm, earth, calm and

391
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,920
mok. Yeah. The end goal of life is mok.

392
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
Now I'm not talking about mok because in

393
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,360
different schools Buddhism mok is

394
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,160
different. Patanjali mok is different.

395
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
Vanta mok. So leave it aside. Dharm is

396
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,240
something very interesting that our

397
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,800
generation needs very bad. If you

398
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,720
understand how dharm works. Dharm is not

399
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,279
a religion by the way. It is the law of

400
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
cosmic nature. We call it the law of

401
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
righteousness. And there are four

402
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,199
important points. If you understand in

403
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,480
this game automatically you start

404
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:15,360
evolving. One is you should give your

405
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,120
best in every situation and that is in

406
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,320
your hands. For example, I'm talking to

407
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,760
you now. I'm giving my best output. What

408
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,760
will you think about me later? I don't

409
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
care. None of my business. If I make

410
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,440
that my business, I'm binded into the

411
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,639
law of karma.

412
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,600
So, giving my best. Second is anywhere

413
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,000
you are placed

414
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,399
100%. Third is no

415
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,720
judgment to anyone and anyone. And

416
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,639
fourth is no expectation. If you are

417
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
implying these, of course, the rules get

418
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,480
higher when you evolve. But basic person

419
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,079
who's walking on the path 100% in any

420
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,199
situation being there I'm sitting here

421
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,120
I'm thinking oh no what I'm going to do

422
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,920
in education tomorrow out or I'm going

423
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,160
to hyder out secondly 100% means you're

424
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,000
there talking also with the person eye

425
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,040
to eye understanding and building that

426
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,959
kind is no judgment and third is no

427
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,680
expectation means no fruits demanded in

428
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,680
return fair this is very much like what

429
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,320
Krishna is saying to practical this is

430
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,760
that very yes very very practical but to

431
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
apply it is very difficult It's very

432
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,959
difficult. Very very difficult. Yeah.

433
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,040
Something comes and just takes you.

434
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,279
Yeah. Right. That you understand. In

435
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,880
fact, when you start understanding this,

436
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,279
the cosmic law will start supporting

437
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,639
you. I have heard of this. I don't

438
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,279
understand this but I have heard of

439
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
this. So when I start understanding and

440
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
I'm going, we call it the flow. You call

441
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,760
it everything. Nature will start

442
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,360
supporting you. The doors will start

443
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,680
opening. You'll start getting help

444
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,399
because you're walking with the current.

445
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,600
If Gangama flowing and I keep a rock, I

446
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,639
become the rock. I'm just going to

447
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,240
damage myself and but if I flow I will

448
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,600
meet the end path but that awareness

449
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,839
should be there and that will only come

450
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,040
when you do sadna. Now people talk about

451
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,079
matri also that is earth uh cal k is

452
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,000
desires earth is money earn money there

453
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,040
is no problem make money do everything

454
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,759
but keeping dharm in mind right and the

455
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,560
end goal is mo right so you'll never get

456
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,199
bored right because I know my goal is to

457
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,279
not come back in this world again I if I

458
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,079
come back not to be affected that is the

459
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,839
reason mo changes so practically if I

460
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,560
put it you just have to be a good human

461
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,040
being first rather than anything else

462
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,199
Right? Be nice. Mind your own business.

463
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,720
Do your own thing. And your most

464
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,480
um intense competition that you're going

465
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
through is with your own self, not with

466
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
others.

467
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,480
That is what I believe firmly. I want to

468
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,399
upgrade myself. If my sadness from A to

469
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
B, I want to take it to A to Z. I don't

470
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,920
care what you are doing. I don't care

471
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,639
what he's doing. I want to evolve. That

472
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,639
attitude is very important.

473
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,720
Sorry. Whatever. I think it's

474
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,639
a

475
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,000
I some days I wonder right I'll tell you

476
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,000
what I have a friend who is a type A

477
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,959
very ambitious very driven type of

478
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,760
person and funnily enough he gets what

479
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,760
he wants he'll take its time but he'll

480
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,520
get what he wants now for him in the

481
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,679
experience what he feels in first person

482
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,839
is I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying and

483
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,679
I get it and then a new search begins

484
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,120
whatever me who sees him intermittently

485
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,240
I see him after 8 months he's gotten

486
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,640
what he wants. And I'm like, "Oh, you

487
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,079
were always going to get it." And then

488
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,039
when he tells me about the struggle, I'm

489
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,319
like, "A lot of this seems psychological

490
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,600
that while you were going through it,

491
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
you're having these conflicts in your

492
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,760
head. Maybe this, maybe that, and in due

493
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
time, you got what you wanted anyway.

494
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,039
Maybe just drop the psychological

495
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,440
conflict. Maybe just stop fighting

496
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,160
internally. Maybe just dance with it and

497
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,480
get to where you're trying to get to."

498
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,880
He says if I don't have that conflict

499
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
then I will not get what I want. I tell

500
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,160
him because you have that conflict you

501
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,559
think getting what you want is harder

502
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,559
than what it is because you what are you

503
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,000
feeding your

504
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,600
system until I fight until I wrestle

505
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,720
with reality it doesn't appear. So when

506
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,400
you get it you feel like it's a

507
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
consequence of wrestling with reality.

508
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,919
Now I don't know what school of thought

509
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
is right. What what do you think? My

510
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,360
point of view is totally different on

511
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,600
this. See your school is right where you

512
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,840
think that just flow semi flow or flow

513
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,640
whatever you call it. My thing is if I

514
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,559
want this glass of water, it is my duty

515
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,559
to give my best and work towards it.

516
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,520
That means I'm free mentally, right? I

517
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,080
get it. If I get it, I cherish it. With

518
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,400
that awareness that is also temporary.

519
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,480
If I don't get it, I know that there is

520
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,840
something better and I will get what I

521
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,039
deserve. On the spot, you're free of

522
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,400
everything. You're relaxed. M that

523
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,400
person that you're talking is mentally

524
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
so messed up because he's not enjoying

525
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,480
life right in this situation also I'm

526
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
enjoying that beautiful sunrise I'm

527
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,039
watching manga I'm enjoying talking to

528
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,120
you right fair and what can you do you

529
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,640
think you are in control your duty is

530
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,799
only one thing to give your best in

531
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,160
every situation so maybe as a wife as a

532
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,240
husband as a brother as a sister as

533
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,000
anything that you take that is my belief

534
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,440
and it is not my belief in fact it is in

535
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,480
Gita it is in every text it seems I

536
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,720
think even even uh when you

537
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,200
said I participate in the world. Um I

538
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,480
think there is a Gita it's Gita only

539
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,080
there's also in the Bible something very

540
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,919
literal about it. Be of the world but

541
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,440
not part of the world or something like

542
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,039
this. There's a whole biblical code. So

543
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
like this is a very understood spiritual

544
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,320
very simple. Now if I jump into tantra

545
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,080
and all then things change then tantra

546
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,160
has you have to worship or into your

547
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,240
sabha your behavior. So they're

548
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
different. The beauty of sanatan is so

549
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,640
clear that depending upon your behavior

550
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
you worship God. There is no one way.

551
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
Yes, there is no one way university

552
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,000
level.

553
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
If you like to your curiosity, you do

554
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
vata. You enjoy it. You'll reach god

555
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,919
your way. If I like to do worship, I

556
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,160
like dies. I'm chantra as my way. If my

557
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,440
sister likes to work karma yogi,

558
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,840
everything is on that is her way.

559
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,120
Everyone has their own ways. No. No hard

560
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,960
and fast rule that if you don't take

561
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,640
this you'll be punished, right? Doesn't

562
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,720
work like this. So, so vanta is the same

563
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,320
as ad vanta or vanta right which is

564
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,440
nonuality. That is known that is the

565
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,799
highest teaching once actually it is a

566
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,520
teaching that is required to get in

567
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,039
day-to-day life to have a good state of

568
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,280
mind and to operate. Explain that

569
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,880
teaching. Um also with vanta I'll

570
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,600
explain one more thing. Vedanta is very

571
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,600
dangerous also because then you don't

572
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,600
participate in the game of life. You

573
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
think that everything is Maya I am

574
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,720
Brahman and then you just become

575
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,240
lethargic and again you come into tamas.

576
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,679
Yeah you you said a lot of words. Yeah,

577
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,720
I want to understand your grammar. No,

578
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,360
no, no. I I completely understand. Um my

579
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,320
my serial question is what is ad vanta?

580
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,919
What is tamasra? Okay, this vanta is a

581
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,039
topic which I can talk about years and

582
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,480
years. But uh let's make it simple. Ad

583
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,000
vanta ad means non-duality. Okay, there

584
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,520
are two there are many schools in vanta

585
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,960
also but I'm just talking about adw

586
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,720
because I think that is what people need

587
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,960
to practically apply in life. School of

588
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,559
non vdanta is the end of vedas which is

589
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,400
upanishad. So when you read nowadays it

590
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,159
is impossible to read V. So I would

591
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,760
recommend read the oponyishad start with

592
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,120
base to get into knowledge texture

593
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,000
knowledge and everything. Now how does

594
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,000
adanta work? Have you heard about

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Einstein? I'm sure you have. Yeah. What

596
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,159
he said he said something very

597
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,640
interesting that um everything is

598
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,360
relative nothing is absolute. That means

599
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,360
in simple language on its own nothing is

600
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,400
value. It is interdependent to have

601
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,799
value. Sure.

602
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:28,960
So but what Vanta says only the absolute

603
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:31,919
is reality rest everything is Maya that

604
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,840
means a source if you understand that

605
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,120
source you will understand the entire

606
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,960
consciousness entire world and

607
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,799
everything for example let me get it

608
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
more practical I'm sure you aware that

609
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,640
the world that you see is upside down

610
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,280
right oh because of the light reflection

611
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,320
sure yeah the brain flips it sure yeah

612
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,240
saying it is Maya isn't it true that the

613
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,919
first image in my eye is upside down And

614
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,559
then the brain flips it. But the world

615
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,799
is straight. Yeah. But it is my only.

616
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,000
No. Sure. Sure. I understand. I

617
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,559
understand the metal. Yeah. It is my

618
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,400
only. So the rishies are saying that I

619
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,600
will just talk about it and I'm asking

620
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,760
you only as if you're sitting. I'm

621
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,840
trying to explain vanta. I'm asking you

622
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,799
a question. What is constant in your

623
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,520
life? Nothing. The most. Yeah. I mean

624
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,120
the fact that it is me who is looking I

625
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,480
think nothing else is just 2 minutes you

626
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
said that past has changed completely.

627
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,840
Your body is changing completely. Yeah.

628
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,080
Yeah. Everything is changing. Then what

629
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,799
are you running

630
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,720
behind? Mhm. Then what you said part

631
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,080
I'll get bored. If you know it yourself

632
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,919
is not constant. Then why are you

633
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,600
running behind it? You'll never be

634
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,360
satisfied because the human mind is

635
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,520
always craving for a constant flow of

636
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,520
ecstasy. Right? Which is the highest

637
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,280
state and that is your birthright. You

638
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,120
think that praar you're doing this

639
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,039
podcast or traveling the world or

640
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,039
meeting Bhaves is your goal. No.

641
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,880
Something you'll crave more. That is the

642
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,240
rishies decoded long time ago. Then

643
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,400
again they went to a very simple

644
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,960
question that if you say that you're

645
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,440
you're the body and this time is

646
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,559
existing is this world a

647
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,559
reality? So they came up with a second

648
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,840
question. I'm making the open very

649
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,480
simple. So they're asking what is

650
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,960
reality? Because many people ask you are

651
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
you know I'm touching you up to real or

652
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,440
you know I'm awake now everything is

653
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,640
real. So the answer is very simple. They

654
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
are saying the three states of

655
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
consciousness that every human being

656
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,120
goes through. The first is the awake

657
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,600
state. I'm awake now. But they have also

658
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,720
answered this beautifully. Reality is

659
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,320
that which never

660
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,720
changes. H this is what modern science

661
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,600
is not able to crack it. Now reality is

662
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,080
that which never changes. That means if

663
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,200
I say I'm awake till I die I should be

664
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,039
awake. It is not possible I'm going to

665
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,799
sleep. Second is a dream state. In your

666
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,880
dream you get multiple dreams. That is

667
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
also changing. And deep sleep is

668
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,200
something if you go in deep sleep you

669
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,080
lose awareness. That is tamas actually.

670
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,320
So reality is what which never changes.

671
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,480
So what how they answer this beautifully

672
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,039
is saying there's only one reality that

673
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,039
is pure consciousness.

674
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,000
If you get tap into that or if you

675
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,159
experience

676
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,799
that what is changing is Maya.

677
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,640
Fair. Fair. So that is in a nutshell. Of

678
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,279
course it goes in detail but it's not

679
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:18,440
touch it will be too much. I see. Have

680
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:24,640
you ever encountered somebody who

681
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:26,720
is at that level? Yes. Many? Not many.

682
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Constantly operating in that state. Very

683
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,080
few. Very few. Very few. Are they

684
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,760
marketkedly different from other humans?

685
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,200
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How? They don't

686
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,720
care. They don't care. They're not like

687
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,080
us who want to come talk about. Of

688
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,679
course, their roles also differently

689
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,159
plays. But yeah, there are people now

690
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,760
also. I believe. Are they more common

691
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,760
than we might think? They are very

692
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,840
common. They are very common. In fact,

693
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,440
you don't realize he met a great saint

694
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,120
who was lying on the floor. We were in

695
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,720
Sri Shalam and um sitting and like

696
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,559
literally I should not say this but

697
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
literally begging. But when we went to

698
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,120
him and he started speaking it was

699
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,600
something. How do you know what is the

700
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,279
symptom?

701
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,480
I think the more spiritually evolved you

702
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,760
come to know who's genuine and who's

703
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,720
not. Sure genuiness is one thing but in

704
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,520
reaching that state there you come to

705
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,000
know I think sad tells you come to know

706
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,360
and is more than that also that uh how

707
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,159
much you have worked on yourself to

708
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,559
understand

709
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,799
them genuine people are there in fact uh

710
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,919
great rishies like

711
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,440
Ramanamarishi Turji they were all in

712
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,480
that state I yeah I mean I I'll give you

713
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,640
a primitive more approximate example I

714
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,360
have always felt and it might sound

715
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,960
biased. It is not. I have always felt my

716
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,159
mother is very special in this way

717
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,520
because in 30 years of being around her,

718
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,960
I have never seen her heavy in her

719
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,880
energy. Speaking in a very vague

720
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,360
language here and what I effectively

721
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,679
mean is almost nothing traps her. Then

722
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,520
she's free. And I keep saying this

723
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,520
privately, never to her directly. I I

724
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,320
think she's not many lifetimes away.

725
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,159
Yeah. It's very distinctly unique from

726
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,600
other people in her family. I think very

727
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,360
distinctly unique from other people in

728
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,039
my family. It's very unique about her

729
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,400
and it's just an instinct I have. I may

730
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,600
be completely you know like this should

731
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,679
be a private grammar whatever but

732
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,640
there's something I can sense there. M

733
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:24,400
um I it that made me wonder if there has

734
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,320
to be more people walking around normal

735
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
consciousness that are much more you

736
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,240
know more than sorry I'm cutting you

737
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,880
more than that I believe no you might be

738
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,720
a great saint I will not come to know

739
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,760
because at that state of consciousness

740
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,080
you can pretend you become very good

741
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,559
actors but only staying with the person

742
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,640
you will come to know how deep are they

743
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,320
enlightened or in higher states or how

744
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,440
they're pretentious that you come and

745
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,200
you know people are Not stupid. People

746
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,559
come to know everyone has you picked up.

747
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,320
You have that instinct. You're staying

748
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,120
with her. You have seen her. You have

749
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,799
studied her. Very rarely have I found

750
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,440
somebody who's just light. Yeah. Like

751
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,919
when we live with a guru, she is

752
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,840
amazing. Like she's 86 now and

753
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,039
um she's just amazing. Never have seen

754
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,480
her, you know, losing

755
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,279
balance any point of worst of the worst

756
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,480
scenarios. And even when she is angry,

757
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,799
it is an act to teach me something.

758
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,039
Anger as a tool as opposed to anger as a

759
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,440
state. Yeah. But inside, I'm sure she's

760
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,360
just laughing and all. Why? Because the

761
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,039
next second she's okay. Nothing has

762
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,799
happened. You were so spot on. I've had

763
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,799
to learn this which is see if you're

764
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,520
doing things and your anger is but

765
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,120
natural. How are you not angry after

766
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,400
you're done with anger? Such an

767
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,559
important trait cuz you could hang up

768
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,720
the phone and laugh. Yeah. And I've seen

769
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,159
it doing her like I because I've stayed

770
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,640
with her for so many days and she is

771
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,640
cutthroat. If you if you are wrong

772
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,640
she'll make you realize and once you

773
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,520
have learned the lesson she is like

774
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,799
nothing has happened but you can't be

775
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,679
normal because again the mind is playing

776
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,000
games. So that shows that there are

777
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,799
people who are

778
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,399
very and you know love joy or being you

779
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,960
know very collective required that is

780
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,440
the experience of their sad and that is

781
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,640
their so it is not just reading the

782
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,520
books or intellectually they have

783
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,200
experienced it and I think that the

784
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,960
source of unconditional love there is no

785
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,880
judgment

786
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,520
fair no judgment about do someone is

787
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,919
doing wrong okay let them do poor thing

788
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,240
doing let them come

789
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,840
out but the lessons are given

790
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,600
I think that is the role of a guru also.

791
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,159
They play multiple and very difficult to

792
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,840
decode them. Very difficult. They are

793
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,720
different different situations. How is

794
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,960
it that you led yourself into this

795
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,640
situation or how does life led you here

796
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,799
into this situation? Because see, I

797
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,480
mean, I'm curious. Um, I'm using myself

798
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,080
as patient just so that it's

799
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,000
easier. And at a certain point, I swear

800
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,919
to God, I've had an instinct. I maybe

801
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,919
need a guru, right? Uh, but one, I

802
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,520
thought if a guru, I need a guru, the

803
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,279
guru will appear, right? Like if if I'm

804
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,399
ready for it, it should automatically

805
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,559
sort of begin to happen. I don't know

806
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,240
where to go search for one. Um, as a

807
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,159
very unique thing that you ended up with

808
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,600
a guru because a curiosity emerged from

809
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,679
you. Tell tell me a little bit about

810
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,880
that.

811
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,559
I think um meeting the guru in this life

812
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,279
is I'm not that capable. It is a past

813
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,640
sanscaras of course you know it but uh

814
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,840
the thought should be there to know the

815
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,880
unknown how you're passionate about it

816
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,520
like you know I want to crack this I

817
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,120
want to go that

818
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,600
it so I think getting a guru is not that

819
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,520
easy in fact the guru knows it a very

820
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,080
highly evolved guru enlightened guru

821
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,679
knows it everything about the disciple

822
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,679
then constant connection but the

823
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,000
disciple should be ready and in fact it

824
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,679
is not the advantage of a guru a guru a

825
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,440
will not come like this they will test

826
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,279
you they will grind you but an

827
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,799
enlightened guru is that guru who will

828
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,279
tell you that I'm not your guru your

829
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,679
guru is inside you if you have met such

830
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,240
a person who unconditionally loving you

831
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,120
not expecting anything and making you

832
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
realize that you are that

833
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,760
truth that is a good what do you think

834
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,200
of somebody like a J Krishna Morti in

835
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,760
that way oh he was a fabulous uh man

836
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,000
what intellect he had

837
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,919
what intellect he wasn't dealing with

838
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,320
deities metaphor he has different

839
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,679
philosophies no Different ways,

840
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
different path of understanding but

841
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,000
adant regards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

842
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,120
Definitely definitely in fact his talks

843
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,600
are very difficult for people to

844
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,200
understand also like Shri though people

845
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,880
don't understand what he's talking but

846
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,240
they if you know and you have experience

847
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,760
then you can crack it he was a great uh

848
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,399
narrator great I'm sure he had some

849
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,159
great experiences you think he was in

850
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,000
the state is is that conversation about

851
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,360
in your circles very we have we have

852
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,640
conversations about what he writes how

853
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,919
he decodes but I think we to talk about

854
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
without staying with him is very

855
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,880
difficult very difficult very difficult

856
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,480
I personally believe now I've stayed

857
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
with My guru I stayed with many gurus I

858
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,440
know about them at the same time you met

859
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,000
people also we know that they're not

860
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,600
there or but you come to know h

861
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,919
interesting

862
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,039
so u I understand ad vant as and this is

863
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,559
my understanding from speaking with

864
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,120
somebody like an achar pashant for that

865
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,919
matter and such ad vant is fairly

866
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,840
intellectual um you can nati ni your way

867
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,360
to that point you know not this it's not

868
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,120
that and I mean this is what I suggest

869
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,520
people

870
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,760
I had this insight maybe a couple years

871
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,799
ago that we do things in this life form

872
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,320
to be done with them. True. And I say

873
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,679
this to people and it's not instinctive

874
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,480
or intuitive to them. I say for

875
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,880
instance, it's a comical example a

876
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,799
14year-old boy when he looks at his

877
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
peers and say they have facial hair. You

878
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,480
really want facial hair. It's a very

879
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,320
common male thing where like you run a

880
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,559
razor

881
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,360
once it happens you don't care about it.

882
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,679
Yeah. the first time somebody's going to

883
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,919
have physical intimacy. Before that,

884
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,159
there's a lot of anticipation. And if

885
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,519
you look at a 45 year old man and maybe

886
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,880
there's no physical intimacy in his life

887
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,799
and he just does not care. And so the

888
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,080
first Mercedes is one of those examples

889
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,000
for the luxury. I want to have my first

890
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,840
luxury car once it happens. And so you

891
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,159
keep doing these things to eventually

892
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,760
realize it's not this, it's not that.

893
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,200
None of these actually serve a purpose.

894
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,480
You keep moving towards a transcendent

895
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,880
place and and hopefully you arrive.

896
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,720
That's virant. I understand that is

897
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,120
human birth is full of experiences. No.

898
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,640
Yes. And each experience reveals itself

899
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,919
as nothing. No. No. Each experience will

900
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,840
either evolve you or bind you. Explain

901
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,440
this to me. This binding thing. So that

902
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,240
means now you said my first experience

903
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,640
of getting a merc. Okay. You are talking

904
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,919
based on some experience. Okay. Now

905
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,080
you're happy with it. But there's

906
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,799
someone like you after merc wants a

907
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,720
beamer whatever it's binding him. Right.

908
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,399
So every experience either bind you or

909
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,440
liberate you. It's very subjective. Oh,

910
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,039
very interesting. And depends over

911
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,240
individuals. Very interesting. I don't

912
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,120
think

913
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,399
so. Now you're telling me that

914
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,320
intimacy someone had an ex someone is

915
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,440
behind it. It will do again again again.

916
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,120
But someone is

917
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,760
like so this is the beauty of human

918
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,399
birth. No. Super interesting. My point

919
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,960
of view this was it's done. Like for

920
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,200
instance fame um it appears very quickly

921
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,039
in my profession. Yeah. Accept it. Now

922
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,960
you're saying you're done. I'm like

923
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,120
whatever fame right like okay but

924
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,039
someone like you may want more I think

925
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,480
wants to do more she wants to do more

926
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,240
more more but you're done but then

927
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,159
you'll go for something else so that

928
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,960
means that means you're evolving right

929
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:25,240
so coming at the peak then you think

930
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,679
okay so you're in that rat race but you

931
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,440
said now I want to do something else so

932
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,760
that experience will either evolve you

933
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,080
or bind you that is completely very

934
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,440
subjective interesting I just always

935
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,600
assumed that the natural progression

936
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,440
towards would be towards letting go.

937
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,960
That is only in your case. It might be

938
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,039
or I might be just blindsided to my own

939
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,880
insufficiencies also. I'm very huh I

940
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,799
understand that. Very good. Um this is

941
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,559
adant and you said you're a mix between

942
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,320
adant and tantra. Tantra is something uh

943
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,080
see nowadays whenever I've heard about

944
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,960
tantra people are thinking that tantra

945
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,320
is kalajadu it is that people won't no

946
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,080
tantra is not like this. In fact, it is

947
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,480
a higher science. When you understand

948
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,880
tens talks about in simple language, not

949
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,640
going technical terms, it is expansion

950
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,480
of consciousness.

951
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,560
It makes you realize that you're beyond

952
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,119
this body, mind and intellect which

953
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,480
leads to vanta only. Eventually

954
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,159
everything eventually will come to

955
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,720
Bhagat Gita of the first three chapters

956
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,480
vanta tantra. The last experience that

957
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,320
the dvta becomes one and you become

958
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,280
omniciently present that is vanta. You

959
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,879
take karma yogi everything is biant

960
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,359
everything comes but the parts are

961
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,280
different. for a karma for a tantra

962
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,839
they're getting in very simple language

963
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
they have defined three

964
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,359
behaviors a person who satic I'm sure

965
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,560
you know what satic is you just do me a

966
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,000
favor and explain regardless I want to

967
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,760
understand your worldview okay so I'm

968
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,599
putting it very simple for a person

969
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,359
who's new to tantra sure not getting

970
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,599
into dtal or getting into that

971
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,520
ritualistic part which was very hectic

972
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,000
tantra has three simple factors if you

973
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,760
understand tantra there are three kinds

974
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,079
of disciples or people who are

975
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,960
worshiping in tantra one is the satic

976
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,200
bhav who is intellectually strong does

977
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,079
all satwa one is ratik who's already

978
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,000
running running running running running

979
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,400
running running and one is tamik who's

980
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,079
very lethargic and lazy so in tantra

981
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,119
there are different methods given that

982
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,560
they all go beyond satwa raja and tama

983
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,160
and experience the formlessness so a

984
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,400
satwa would be given a method that takes

985
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,920
him beyond satwa and beyond rajas also

986
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,839
so like yeah same like bhagat gita sure

987
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
same like it comes to so tantra is very

988
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,240
simple but when you go dwell into deeper

989
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,079
aspects of tantra tantra is yantra

990
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,040
mantra Ra tantra yantra is the form

991
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,800
mantra is the sound yantra mantra tantra

992
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,400
is the final end meeting of everything.

993
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,440
So when I say praar praar is the mantra

994
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,079
for example you are the form and when

995
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,160
comes to the conclusion it is tantra

996
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,560
taking everything above so in that we

997
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,359
have mudras we have to do a lot of sadna

998
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,040
worship gods there's a different way so

999
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,880
every path has different way so I don't

1000
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,480
know where people are getting worried

1001
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,400
about tantra but it's very simple in

1002
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,040
fact any puja you do even offering

1003
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,480
coconut is tantra any worship that you

1004
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,079
do is tantra huh but depends is it Right

1005
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
hand or left hand. Now going into a bit

1006
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,640
detail. Sure. The right hand saddak is

1007
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,400
all satic people. The left hand sadic

1008
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,640
with the sadic change of yard may eat

1009
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
alcohol. So depending upon your sabha

1010
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,119
you worship god because in sanatan there

1011
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,520
is no hell or heaven. Hell or heaven is

1012
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:29,079
in our mind. Simple. So you're saying

1013
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,920
that tantra is effectively this

1014
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,440
self-trcendent aspect that emerges from

1015
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,119
expanding your consciousness. Yes. The

1016
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,880
goal is to expand our consciousness. How

1017
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,480
does what what does expanding your

1018
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,160
consciousness mean and how does one do

1019
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,240
that? So okay what I explained

1020
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,920
previously about tantra was just an just

1021
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,599
not even like taking you to the candy

1022
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,359
shop and all just showing you outside

1023
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,599
expanding the consciousness simple term

1024
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,240
is that making you realize that you're

1025
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,079
beyond this punchima buddhas the five

1026
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,839
senses the the punchabhas are earth fire

1027
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,839
elements five elements we think we are

1028
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,599
this body we are not then making you

1029
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,079
realize that beyond the senses also we

1030
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,079
have 11 senses we are beyond that also

1031
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,400
and making you realize that only in the

1032
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,160
human body you can experience That is

1033
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,160
sense which is greater than sex, greater

1034
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,359
than food, greater than sleep and

1035
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,240
greater than jealousy, anxiety, fear. So

1036
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:24,000
in tantra it is said a person who

1037
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,800
capable of not getting entangled between

1038
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,960
food, sleep, sex and fear is capable of

1039
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,320
doing higher sadhana.

1040
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
So these are the four things that we

1041
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,400
have to first be aware and move ahead of

1042
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,320
it. At some point I think I came across

1043
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,720
some texts in Buddhist tantra which I'm

1044
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,960
assuming would be very different from

1045
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,640
Hindu. When you talk about viganov

1046
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,200
tantra, Buddhist chantra, they are

1047
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,040
similar but the forms and the worship is

1048
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,599
a bit different. Right. And it spoke of

1049
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,800
something called the higher method and

1050
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,280
the lower method. The mahayana

1051
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,200
and right and uh the descriptions in the

1052
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,440
text I were reading were very radical.

1053
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,440
Um so I I think if I remember correctly

1054
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,920
it said something about how the tantric

1055
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,200
Buddhism is a highway to enlightenment

1056
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,520
as opposed to your regular stuff which

1057
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,079
is it'll take its lifetimes and you have

1058
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,839
to do very revolutionary things like

1059
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,280
maybe eat feal matter and there were

1060
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,720
suggestions of this nature that I didn't

1061
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,240
completely understand or could make

1062
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,240
sense of is that am I remembering

1063
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,880
correctly or you're talking in a right

1064
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,960
way but even in tantra as we dwell into

1065
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,720
deeper aspects there are different paths

1066
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,640
also given where depending upon your

1067
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,200
sabha you take the path like a path of

1068
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,599
an aguri or path of a person living in

1069
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,079
swashan or many many ways in that

1070
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,000
imagine a state let me be very very

1071
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,520
simple imagine there's a state where you

1072
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
are not affected by anything in the

1073
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,400
world maybe fal matter maybe diamond

1074
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,920
maybe having anything in a from the

1075
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,359
dusbin because you have come to

1076
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,000
realization that everything is divine

1077
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,240
mother if you are into that state you

1078
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,880
have become a siddha so there are

1079
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,480
methods also taken there aa so those

1080
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,880
methods exist for a certain sabha

1081
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,480
certain sabha not for everyone not for

1082
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,880
everyone but I feel like it's very hard

1083
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,240
for somebody to selfdeiper all like I

1084
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,320
think a guru is then very required in

1085
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,160
something because who's going to reflect

1086
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,920
and tell me what so you know we call

1087
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,400
tantra I tell this all the time because

1088
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,480
I personally believe that tantra is

1089
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,320
walking on the razor's edge you're

1090
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,720
walking on the razor's edge one side is

1091
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,119
the value of ego and other side is a

1092
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,160
value of desires but that razor's edge

1093
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,480
is a shortcut so that shortcut to cross

1094
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,640
anoguru otherwise you will be messing up

1095
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,640
completely. Have you seen people messed

1096
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,440
up from this kind of stuff? I I have met

1097
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,200
few people. Yes. Yeah. They they get

1098
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,599
mental hallucinations. They start

1099
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,960
getting uh Yeah. They get messed up.

1100
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,320
That is the reason the guru takes you

1101
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
back to reality saying that no, don't

1102
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,480
get entangled. Your goal is going beyond

1103
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,839
the consciousness this limited. Yeah.

1104
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,200
Because I've read a lot of these people

1105
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:51,359
who will have clear symptoms of

1106
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,960
psychosis talk about how their condalini

1107
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,200
is messed up also. And that's a very

1108
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,320
common internet trope. If you go to/ini

1109
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,760
or whatever you find a lot of these

1110
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,160
people and I wonder what's happening

1111
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,680
there. See I don't know people talk

1112
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,960
about kin very very very casually kini

1113
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,800
awakening is not for everyone once

1114
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,640
you're kin awaken you're not the same.

1115
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,160
Yeah that's what I to be honestly I

1116
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,359
avoid I run away from such topics

1117
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,119
because these topics are so beautiful so

1118
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,480
experiential and nowadays people have

1119
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,079
just destroyed it. They've made it

1120
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,040
snacks. They have made it snacks and I

1121
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,760
think uh any anyone Tom Dick and Harry

1122
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,839
goes easy. Huh. any Tom Dick and Harry

1123
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,680
that I can awaken or third chakra. It

1124
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,160
doesn't work like this. It doesn't work

1125
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,839
like this. In fact, great gurus they all

1126
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,400
had a all of them. I'm sure in their own

1127
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:40,960
methods. So no matter what path you take

1128
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:43,000
a you take bi you take karma but if you

1129
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,520
talk from vantic point of view is

1130
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,839
Maya doesn't exist everything is Maya.

1131
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,079
So depending upon your sabha again sad

1132
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,560
should be done. Interesting.

1133
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,160
Interesting. explain to me uh this idea

1134
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,079
of agoris also because I think during

1135
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,760
the makum this sort of picked up a

1136
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,839
little and like it's very hard to

1137
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,920
explain somebody who's not native to

1138
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,640
this land what agoris are you know we

1139
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,319
were very fortunate to live with the um

1140
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,800
agoris and the nagas in the kum this

1141
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,640
time and they are very gentle people

1142
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,200
they are very they're doing their own

1143
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,280
thing so I don't know why there is so

1144
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,720
much misconception that the nagas are

1145
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,839
like this the aguris are like this I

1146
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,319
think they're very happy in their own

1147
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,000
world they don't want actual agura They

1148
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,839
don't want name. They don't want fame.

1149
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,240
In fact, I met a great Aguri was very

1150
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,160
well spoken in English. Traveled the

1151
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,119
world, seen everything and then took the

1152
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,680
path. I used to live in a kapal and his

1153
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,599
English was fabulous. His experiences

1154
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,000
were fabulous. But you would not realize

1155
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,000
very simple man. How is an agori

1156
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,119
different in their swabhawa or they an

1157
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,319
agori? There's a very beautiful phrase.

1158
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,720
Know what is day for a normal being is a

1159
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,720
night for aguri and what is night for

1160
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,560
people like us is day for agori because

1161
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,920
they are sad starts in the night and

1162
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,920
actual agur will never leave the

1163
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,040
cremation ground his home is that h he

1164
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,160
will die live eat everything there

1165
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,160
only and then if he wants to go to

1166
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,440
another cremation ground he'll move in

1167
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,040
the night only and no publicity nothing

1168
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,720
they don't want what is the what is the

1169
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,040
ration that is their sabha that is their

1170
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,319
sadha that is their journey

1171
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,280
In fact, we met at met a very

1172
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,359
interesting agur baba in Kashi also very

1173
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,800
well spoken very simple and he just said

1174
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,440
love is everything unconditional love

1175
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,880
without judgment you see divine mother

1176
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,640
everywhere and everything are you in

1177
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,920
that state he asked I said I'm praying

1178
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,119
that one day we get there he just

1179
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,560
started laughing why because he said

1180
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,920
you're walking on the path don't lie to

1181
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,440
me so they are aware and they're very

1182
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,000
simple and what they show on TV what are

1183
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,000
our just I it's a dramatized it's a

1184
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,920
dramatizer yeah right it's dramatized

1185
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
way. Of course, their practices are

1186
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,000
intense. In fact, in auror, there are

1187
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
practices where you go in the smashan

1188
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,480
and you're in a certain stage of

1189
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,480
evolution where you have to walk and not

1190
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,640
look behind. So there are practices with

1191
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,480
the but the guru is very important. So I

1192
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,800
think these things should be left only

1193
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,240
under the guru and the

1194
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,839
shasha and it is not meant for us. They

1195
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,599
walk through fire. They walk through

1196
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,359
fire. You know they walk through the

1197
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,160
swashan guard and there are entities

1198
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,720
that call you and all be but it is said

1199
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,880
that it is meant full of esoteric what

1200
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,880
needs to be done and you know even a

1201
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,240
swashan they do sadna many many things

1202
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,640
in fact there's a very beautiful story

1203
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,880
of an auror where uh he was a great

1204
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,960
enlightened being I can't recollect his

1205
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,119
name but uh he was a siddha born

1206
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,680
enlightened and he goes to swashan to do

1207
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,079
sadna and then there is this so-called

1208
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,400
entity it's a story not reality but make

1209
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,000
us realize so there's There's one entity

1210
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,359
that comes and tells him, "What do you

1211
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,280
want? I'll give you everything that you

1212
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,480
want. Everything. Tell me what you want.

1213
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,079
You want name? You want fame? You want

1214
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,839
power? What do you want?" He's sitting.

1215
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,599
He's sitting. He said, "Please don't

1216
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,680
bother me. Let me meditate. I'm here for

1217
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,280
my sad." Again, next day he goes in the

1218
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,040
night. She comes to him. Tell me what do

1219
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,200
you want? I will do this. I I'll take

1220
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,280
you to top of the world. This happens

1221
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,960
for a month. Then that great Siddha is

1222
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,680
tired and he says, "You know what? I

1223
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,480
have hepatitis on my right leg. Move it

1224
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,400
to my left leg. Free. I don't want to

1225
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,480
get entangled." M that is the state of

1226
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,800
an evol being

1227
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,880
that's a funny story. Yeah. So when you

1228
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,040
go into auror and you have a right guru

1229
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,040
the guru will make you realize you may

1230
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,520
get supernatural powers you may get name

1231
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,079
you may get fame you don't want that you

1232
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,480
want is the essence of god. I was

1233
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,839
recently in an interview um where I was

1234
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,359
the guest and they were talking to me

1235
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,760
about love and they were talking to me

1236
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,280
about forms of love that men have as

1237
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,000
opposed to forms of love that females

1238
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,599
might have. And it kind of felt like

1239
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,760
this could enter a tricky territory for

1240
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,280
public conversation. Um and I was trying

1241
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,800
to explain to them I said something

1242
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,680
along the lines of if you want to see

1243
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,040
the way a man loves watch him weep his

1244
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,240
beloved at the funeral at the cremation

1245
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,240
ground. Right? If you it's a genuine

1246
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,480
experience. Uh two of my close friends

1247
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,079
are twins. Um they lost their father

1248
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,720
recently. I woke up one day I got a text

1249
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,880
is like last week um boys lost their

1250
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,040
father come to the cremation ground and

1251
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,800
I was standing there and it's a surreal

1252
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,000
experience. It's a surreal experience

1253
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,040
being at a cremation ground. You watch

1254
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,400
60 plus years of memories being burned

1255
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,680
down true by the children of the person

1256
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,079
who's passed

1257
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,920
in for the purpose of making their

1258
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,520
memories immortal. It's a very weird

1259
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,400
thing. You watch them cry but you also

1260
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,160
watch them relieve themselves. It's a

1261
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,440
range of emotions. It's you getting

1262
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,960
perspective on your own life. You

1263
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,400
realizing how quick and fast and

1264
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,720
meaningless all of this is if you don't

1265
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,960
wake up. Um and I think one of the best

1266
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,040
ways to enter into spirituality is to

1267
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,800
spend a day in a shamshan. Yeah. True.

1268
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,960
That is what the first teaching of agur

1269
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,079
is. When he met the aguri he said if you

1270
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,839
think you're so um smart come to the

1271
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,280
smashan and see you will see that

1272
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,319
everything is nothing is permanent. In

1273
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,000
fact my guru

1274
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,920
whenever I used to get up and down in my

1275
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,839
sad she used to tell me bes whenever you

1276
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,839
go to a smashan you forget everything

1277
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,520
but the problem is when you come out you

1278
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,440
forget the smashan and again you get

1279
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,160
entangled

1280
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,440
that is so true right yeah and who's a

1281
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,839
person who's evolved who's always in

1282
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,599
balance he enjoys everything but at the

1283
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,400
same time he knows everything is

1284
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,240
temporary

1285
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,839
that is a very highly evolved being

1286
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,040
according to me there was a very

1287
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,599
interesting experience in my last

1288
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,200
vipashna um it was a very painful one I

1289
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,280
think much more painful than I was ready

1290
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,960
for or

1291
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,400
like be when I came out and people were

1292
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,520
like how was it I was like if I tell you

1293
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,760
you won't go so don't ask me but it was

1294
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,000
an experience after 7 8 days of intense

1295
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,319
agony one day something burst open

1296
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,160
pavish I don't know what happened it's

1297
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:42,079
it's the afternoon walk I'm having it

1298
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:45,440
and suddenly pure ecstasy just flowing

1299
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:48,000
through me every step I took boom just

1300
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,680
blasting into happiness is I can when I

1301
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,880
think of my family just pure pleasure

1302
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,359
emerges. When I think of all my work or

1303
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,440
like my friends or like the anything I

1304
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:00,640
thought of it's just pure pleasure right

1305
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,920
and in that I'm aware that this is going

1306
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,480
to pass and I was like what a strength

1307
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,599
to have built up that I'm experiencing

1308
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,440
such joy but completely aware it's maybe

1309
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,680
20 minutes or 2 hours or 2 days at rest.

1310
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:19,040
Imagine maintaining that state and

1311
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,880
consciously being in that state. It's so

1312
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,960
difficult to explain cuz I would touch a

1313
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,160
leaf and I was like what? This is so

1314
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,079
beautiful. It's so different from my

1315
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,079
normal waking consciousness. I can't

1316
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,000
explain it to somebody. I can't even go

1317
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,040
back at choice. It is not meant to be

1318
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,960
explained. It is only between you and

1319
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,200
the experience. Right? That is the

1320
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,280
beauty because words can't get it down.

1321
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,560
And I think uh it is the birth right

1322
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,319
that we have to stay in that

1323
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,720
consciousness at least I think everyone

1324
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,800
gets it you know at some point yeah

1325
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,599
unaware I think it's more prominent when

1326
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,920
you're a kid to feel that way and it

1327
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,400
just fades over a period of time uh I

1328
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,720
think it was sguru who mentioned to me

1329
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,480
about or it was satya I'm not sure which

1330
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,319
one said living by memory and living by

1331
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,920
experience is two different modalities

1332
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,680
what happens is you grow up and all this

1333
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,119
is memory so your drive back home is

1334
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,640
shorter because it's all memory you

1335
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,800
don't experience the road anymore the

1336
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,400
way you used to and uh more than that

1337
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,720
the older you get the concept of time

1338
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,640
changes drastically. Yeah. It becomes

1339
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,319
shorter. You've psychologically lived

1340
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,319
half your life by the age of 24. Of

1341
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,160
course. How old are you? 24. Yeah. Your

1342
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,359
half half of your life is done with bro.

1343
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,079
Can you believe it? It is such a

1344
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,839
shocking fact that by 24 your half your

1345
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,520
memories are already made. That is the

1346
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,920
reason. No. In one birth we are living

1347
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,480
multiple lives. You said that earlier.

1348
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,079
Explain it. Explain it for me. You know

1349
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,440
we were talking earlier. You said

1350
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,800
childhood was different. Now it is

1351
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,680
different. And with time you don't even

1352
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,760
realize how you were 10 years ago. Yeah.

1353
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,160
Right. And I believe every day we are

1354
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,000
changing. Every day we evolving. Again

1355
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,760
it is very subjective. Either you evolve

1356
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,359
or you get in the trap is up to you. And

1357
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,440
I think when you experience such higher

1358
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,520
states of consciousness you don't need

1359
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,880
anything. Then food, sex, drugs, nothing

1360
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,720
matters because you have tasted the

1361
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,680
nectar of life and you want to be in

1362
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,839
that state you can't get there because

1363
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,599
you don't have knowledge.

1364
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,760
Fair. So knowledge is very important.

1365
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,960
Right. Right. Have you have you

1366
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,880
experienced something like this? I am

1367
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,160
nothing to experience anything. No, but

1368
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,680
like I mean temporarily have you

1369
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,119
experienced like a state of ecstasy or

1370
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,280
bliss. Beautiful states. Beautiful

1371
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,240
state. But again, no, it's very uh

1372
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,559
dangerous because so much ego and pride

1373
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,839
I think it is his Yeah. Yeah. It is not

1374
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,160
mine like I didn't I didn't produce it

1375
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,680
by anyone. Everyone experiences it.

1376
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,079
Everyone

1377
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,240
and once you get that state or that kick

1378
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,319
or that taste you know beautiful saying

1379
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,079
no after tasting honeyole enjoy white

1380
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:37,640
sugar.

1381
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,240
Fair. Yeah. That is a state. Um do

1382
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,790
you generally answer a question like

1383
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,000
what is a good

1384
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:45,559
[Music]

1385
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,440
death? I think

1386
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:51,440
um we die before dying.

1387
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,240
What do you mean? That means there is so

1388
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,040
much fear of loss in our head. As we

1389
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,760
grow older, we are already dying every

1390
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,319
day. I think nobody ever told me that

1391
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,960
with growing older what will emerge that

1392
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:06,920
did not previously exist is my past.

1393
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,400
Because when

1394
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:12,880
you were there's nostalgia that consumes

1395
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,119
your mind. But suddenly one day you old

1396
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,960
enough to have nostalgia. And you wish

1397
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,440
for that as much as you wish for this

1398
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,880
the future and the past. For a long time

1399
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,359
the only struggle in my life was my

1400
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,520
future. Now I also deal with my past.

1401
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,040
Yeah. And at the same time again your

1402
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,119
future and again my future and then my

1403
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,359
past and it keeps moving like this. And

1404
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,240
uh there's a very famous line from Randi

1405
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:36,319
future like it ends up being like this.

1406
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,040
You know if you ask me about death it's

1407
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:42,400
a personal thing. I think every night

1408
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,520
when I go to sleep I just pray because I

1409
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,079
don't know next morning if I'll wake up

1410
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,240
or not.

1411
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,760
So I think we die every night. Sure.

1412
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,079
Because I don't know what tomorrow is

1413
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,000
holding. Right. At the same time I think

1414
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,800
death is something which is never in our

1415
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,920
hands. But if I know that I'm not this

1416
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,800
body and this is all Maya, then I'm dead

1417
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,160
alive doesn't matter. Sure. But I mean,

1418
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,000
would it really not if I brought a knife

1419
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,040
near you? Would you not like flinch and

1420
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,079
be like, "Oh, what are you doing?" Like,

1421
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,920
if I pulled a knife right now, see,

1422
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,319
human instincts will come. Yeah. But if

1423
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,480
I'm supposed to survive, I'll survive. I

1424
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,000
mean, that know if

1425
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,520
I've said this often and I've spoken

1426
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,880
about this with almost all spiritual

1427
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,160
conversations I do because here's my

1428
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,640
antithesis. Okay? And this is my lesson

1429
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:27,680
from the limited spiritual history I've

1430
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,280
read that are you tell me you know

1431
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,400
you're a enlightened person you put

1432
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,680
together a bunch of people around you

1433
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,359
who learn from you this is the way

1434
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,040
history has worked Jesus did this Buddha

1435
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,960
did this you know great rishies have

1436
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,720
taught people when they came to

1437
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,319
eventually what happens is the ingroup

1438
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,280
comes in conflict with the outroup

1439
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,440
somebody says not you and then you know

1440
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,680
there is conflict and even your most

1441
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,520
spiritual self does not survive a

1442
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,640
political conflict because if somebody

1443
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,920
picks picks up a knife, you have to

1444
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,760
defend yourself. You can't answer

1445
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,200
material threat with spiritual power.

1446
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,960
No, no. See, first thing is um there are

1447
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,880
two aspects to it. I'll give you another

1448
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,599
example which will connect to this. I

1449
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,250
know someone very strange somewhere. He

1450
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,040
tried to do suicide.

1451
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:13,280
[Music]

1452
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,400
Still moving still at it at it at it

1453
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,559
everything at it. Right.

1454
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,680
And he wanted to die. Interesting. Now,

1455
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,480
how is that possible if I ask you?

1456
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,319
I mean, I I He wanted to die. Yeah, he

1457
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,640
wanted He did many things. He did many

1458
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,400
things. He had rat poison also. Maybe

1459
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,480
he's

1460
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,359
incompetent. Like he had rat poison also

1461
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,440
and survived. Huh? How do you justify

1462
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,240
this?

1463
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,520
The desires to

1464
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,680
die then he gave up and now he's doing

1465
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,720
very good in life and he's very grateful

1466
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,440
that that didn't happen. So what I infer

1467
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,359
is there is some karmic bond and no one

1468
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,920
can run against that. If a time of death

1469
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:56,400
has come, you will die anyhow. Heart

1470
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,240
attack say and if that time of death has

1471
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,079
come by you stabbing me, it is going to

1472
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,520
come. I may be an enlightened being. I

1473
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,040
may be a stupid man. I may be a dumb

1474
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,040
man. I'm going to die. This is my

1475
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,119
understanding. But if my time of death

1476
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,520
has not come then even after stabbing I

1477
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,200
will survive. No but the odds change

1478
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,119
drastically after and before being

1479
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,200
stabbed. After stabbing your chances of

1480
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,520
surviving are lesser. But that is a

1481
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,119
karmic bond. No. So you saying you are

1482
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,280
willing to gamble your life on your

1483
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,720
karma. Who I'm willing to gamble in this

1484
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,280
point of time if you ask me and I know

1485
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,280
people will not accept it. The knife is

1486
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,680
Kali. The man who's stabbing me is Kali.

1487
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,839
So why should I worry? So you my faith

1488
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,760
is so strong and if I talk about

1489
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,680
surrender and I'm in complete surrender.

1490
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,640
I know then what's it to worry? Okay. So

1491
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,160
let me pay. But I'm not stupid that

1492
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,880
so you will negotiate with me like

1493
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,400
hypothetical I I pull out a knife and

1494
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,680
I'm like body reflex will work. Yeah.

1495
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,800
No. Yeah. That will happen and then I'll

1496
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,720
be like bhish I'm going to stab you.

1497
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,240
Will you try and convince me to not

1498
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,680
but why will you stab me? First question

1499
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,880
will come in my heart like logically I'm

1500
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,480
talking like you are right. Huh? Suppose

1501
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,400
I I you are in a dark part of the town

1502
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,040
and I'm trying to rob you and after I'm

1503
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,800
done robbing

1504
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:13,520
you seconds you will come

1505
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:15,040
in I'll just be in that scenario if

1506
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,400
you're talking yeah yeah I mean I use

1507
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,000
the example more broadly what I'm trying

1508
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,000
to say is suppose there is incoming

1509
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,760
physical harm from somebody wants to

1510
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,359
beat you up will you try and negotiate

1511
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,920
your way out it's there's a very fine

1512
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:28,000
line between spiritual and being stupid

1513
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,760
I will not be stupid yes agreed That's

1514
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,559
exactly what I want. Huh. Yeah. So you

1515
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,559
will you will try and be

1516
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,319
like so I'll talk to N me eventually.

1517
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,880
Right. Sure. I'm not Superman that.

1518
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:46,640
Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Yeah.

1519
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,680
And so the the spirituality which is the

1520
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,680
Yeah. But while dying I'll have no

1521
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:54,160
regrets. While dying I'll have no fear.

1522
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,520
That's and while dying I'm already free

1523
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,040
in this world. So what that is going to

1524
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,440
take away from me? That is the question

1525
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,359
I was asking about what is a good death.

1526
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,480
No fear, no this this is the answer I

1527
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,800
was looking for. Okay. Okay. Okay. Fair

1528
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,240
fair. So even if I go I get a heart

1529
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,000
attack, I have no fear because I'm not

1530
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,800
dying. Only the body is dying. And so do

1531
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,960
you wonder where the attention the

1532
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,640
awareness the cons consciousness go? Is

1533
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,200
that part of your depends upon how you

1534
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,200
have lived your life?

1535
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,240
The way you have lived your what's your

1536
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,160
age? I'm sorry. I'm 29. 29 of years of

1537
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,440
years you have lived will determine the

1538
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,480
moment before you die. If you're

1539
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,400
attached to something that thought will

1540
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,839
be running to you. Agreed. And that will

1541
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,559
determine your death. But in my case

1542
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,760
there's no regret. I was born by her

1543
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,599
will. I'll die by her will. Simple. And

1544
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,960
what people will cry for one year people

1545
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,599
think on my birthdays eventually they'll

1546
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,720
forget that also. Yeah. Yeah.

1547
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,960
Everybody die and pass. Yeah. Right. No

1548
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,359
one cares. What matters is how I have

1549
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,280
lived. the quality of I have lived the

1550
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,480
memories of the sadness that I have and

1551
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,079
how much I've evolved that is what

1552
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,920
matters in my case for me very

1553
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,839
subjective do you and I have done

1554
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:02,720
justice to my life or not

1555
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,160
do you wonder if because see this is a

1556
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,440
great answer to the question I want to

1557
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,280
die with no fear because I wonder if at

1558
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,280
what you feel at the point of death I am

1559
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,640
asking you one thing yes please when you

1560
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,920
are born we celebrate everyone's

1561
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,319
birthday you celebrated your birthday my

1562
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,040
birthday when I'm when I'm dying when

1563
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:21,520
I'm dying why are People are crying

1564
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,960
because there is fear of unseen.

1565
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,520
Exactly. So why should I worry about

1566
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,240
unseen? I wonder if there is at least a

1567
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,760
slight cause of celebration at death. I

1568
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,599
think life is meant to be celebrated

1569
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,359
even when you are born, not born or even

1570
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,880
after death. Entire life is celebration

1571
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,480
because everything is Maya. No. How can

1572
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,000
you forget the basic principles? Tell

1573
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,319
me.

1574
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,760
Fair. Yeah. Right. So at least there is

1575
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,079
and especially somebody who's lived

1576
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,200
completely. If you say worldly

1577
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,480
responsibility, somebody who's done

1578
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,400
that, somebody who's late 90s, hundreds,

1579
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,680
who's done a full life, at their death,

1580
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,720
there should be at least slight cause

1581
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,000
for celebration. I don't know if it's a

1582
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,680
radical idea. In fact, you know, when

1583
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,799
people die, this may sound very strange,

1584
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,200
but if I see someone is dying, I am sad

1585
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,640
because the the sad for the family, but

1586
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,799
happy for the person because he's free

1587
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,240
from the misery, right? What happens

1588
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,839
after death? Of course, there's a full

1589
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,720
literature on it, full gut pura,

1590
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,359
everything.

1591
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,760
But at the m in fact I think what death

1592
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:16,359
according to me is living in anxiety,

1593
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,480
fear, jealousy, constantly cribbing,

1594
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:20,799
crying. You're in death, you're not

1595
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,520
living and life is very short. Live

1596
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:27,839
moments, experience, breathe.

1597
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:30,400
How old are you? I am 36.

1598
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:32,720
Um, I feel very old in front of you by

1599
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,839
the way now. Maybe my questions are very

1600
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,280
childish. Maybe that is why. Um, yeah.

1601
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:40,400
Yeah. No, I mean I think you come from a

1602
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,599
very wise or if not wise, a very curious

1603
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,280
spot. Maybe that's a humbler way of

1604
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,040
putting it. Like you've actually put

1605
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,960
your money where your mouth is and your

1606
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,400
time where your desire is and you've

1607
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,839
gone after looking for these things,

1608
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,839
trying to understand the unknown, trying

1609
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,040
to see what you can make sense of and

1610
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:56,880
then you know you you're a very humble

1611
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,880
communicator of it as well. My dear, I'm

1612
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:01,920
nothing operator. She does everything.

1613
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:04,319
The fact that she wants me if she will

1614
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,240
not let me in also.

1615
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,400
And people say that oh it's an

1616
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,799
imagination talking to Kali and all. So

1617
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,480
those who know know those who don't know

1618
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:15,440
they don't need to know. Explain the

1619
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,559
experience of talking to Kali. Oh she's

1620
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,079
then what happens? You close your eyes

1621
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,160
and you can hear her. She's in

1622
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,359
everything. No. Uh if you think that

1623
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,960
okay I'm not talking about higher

1624
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,160
states. Normally if you think that one

1625
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,400
day she's going to come and tell you oh

1626
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,480
you're not

1627
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,720
praising very rare when you're a very

1628
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,200
evolved being. But you know for normal

1629
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,839
people like us she will open doors help

1630
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,839
you someone will come and help you some

1631
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:40,720
direction will come automatically some

1632
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,920
flow she's always around but the problem

1633
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,680
is you don't want that what she's giving

1634
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,440
you want something else only she's

1635
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,480
giving you a nice house but you want

1636
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,319
that 1050 building flows building which

1637
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,599
is not meant for you the smaller will

1638
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,040
appreciating but once you realize that

1639
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,119
small house will give you everything in

1640
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,119
return that is where the flow of

1641
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,319
surrender comes yeah so and it seems

1642
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,920
like a very interesting part of your

1643
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,520
philosophy Because I'll tell you what,

1644
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,480
I'll give you my honest feedback. Right?

1645
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,160
This is a it's a it's a conversational

1646
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,400
issue very often with people from the

1647
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,559
spirituality is because their worldview

1648
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,839
is

1649
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,520
it it's without this and without that ni

1650
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,720
in a way right like I am nothing is

1651
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,480
something that you would expect somebody

1652
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:23,920
who's on the spiritual path to say no no

1653
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:25,359
no no why no why is it no no why you are

1654
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,520
nothing but that doesn't mean that you

1655
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,799
don't operate no no of course of course

1656
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,319
what I'm trying to say is it becomes

1657
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,559
very difficult to have a conversation

1658
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:36,440
yeah yeah that is very Right? Because so

1659
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:40,520
I have to sort of pull out an

1660
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:43,040
answer because

1661
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,880
please very they will dedicate

1662
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,920
everything to Radha and at that point

1663
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,680
how do I ask a question and so like that

1664
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,440
that sort of accept it because you know

1665
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,920
it is important because now when I'm

1666
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,559
talking to you I also being very aware

1667
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,880
that oh I know so many things is my

1668
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,400
downfall so I offer it to generally I'm

1669
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,000
not vocal about it but I'm being vocal

1670
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,160
because you feel like you'll I'll

1671
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,400
understand. Yeah. Yes. And I think you

1672
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,240
are a

1673
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,680
curious man to actually apply it also

1674
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,119
somewhere. Right. And I'm humble enough

1675
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,559
to be like my point of view does not

1676
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,839
matter here, right? And I'm really

1677
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,119
understanding your point of view also

1678
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:18,319
because that curious point is very

1679
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,760
important. So it is balancing back and

1680
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,599
forth but generally when we talk outside

1681
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,520
I said okay you are the king you be the

1682
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,760
king your life your ship your rules do

1683
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,200
whatever you want it is not my place.

1684
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,119
But now we're talking because I think it

1685
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,599
is required. Right. I I I completely

1686
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,680
understand.

1687
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,000
It's

1688
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:39,440
a it's a very interesting sort of bent

1689
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,720
to have to life as well. Um but when I I

1690
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,319
asked you a question earlier on which is

1691
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,720
what is your philosophy and I'm

1692
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,480
realizing with a man like yourself it's

1693
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,640
harder to get the answer directly what I

1694
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,480
come to realize after about 20 30 40

1695
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,599
minutes of talking is that a large part

1696
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,319
of your philosophy is surrender. I think

1697
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,960
uh you know everyone talks about

1698
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:01,280
surrender bi it is very very difficult

1699
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,640
very very difficult because I think uh

1700
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,079
it is very easy to say that I leave

1701
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,319
everything in the hands of Bhagwan or

1702
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,160
Kali or Shiva Shakya and everything but

1703
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:14,160
surrender can only be possible when you

1704
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,480
have elements of gan and karam together

1705
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,440
and imagine where you are in a state

1706
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,040
where you don't take any credit at the

1707
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,319
same time you don't take any downfall

1708
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,880
and you know there's someone looking

1709
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,640
have to just leave it in their hands.

1710
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,720
both easier but in situation if you do

1711
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,559
that and you're aware about it in Bhagat

1712
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,520
Gita beautifully you know sitta there's

1713
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,040
a man a man with a steady intellect

1714
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,720
no matter what happens intellect is very

1715
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,200
steady if you are in that steady

1716
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,280
intellect you are evolving that is the

1717
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,640
first step of bacti so everything you're

1718
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:48,480
do and in fact bi also gets difficult

1719
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:50,720
when even in my enemy I see divinity

1720
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,240
fair right so they're evolving if you

1721
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,079
have experienced such states and that

1722
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,200
time if someone is yelling at you or

1723
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,440
someone is doing something wrong and

1724
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,040
you've realized oh he's doing it

1725
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,079
ignorance I should just pray for them

1726
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,680
you know softness you have kindness

1727
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,359
towards yes then compassion compassion

1728
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:05,599
will come that's compassion is a you

1729
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,839
know a great enlightened or evol being

1730
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,319
has two important traits uh one is

1731
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:12,720
humbleness second is compassion

1732
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:14,160
right um to go back to my question I was

1733
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,440
asking what does surrender look like

1734
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,119
what does it feel like how does how does

1735
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,680
one do it how does one practice this in

1736
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,720
daily life how to put it in simple

1737
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,480
language um

1738
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,839
you want me to try Yeah, I have an

1739
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,200
amateur version of all of these things,

1740
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:29,440
right? Like I have a grammar for this

1741
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,160
because I I'm a collector of experiences

1742
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,640
and I'm a writer of thoughts. Um I think

1743
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,400
there are two states. This is very

1744
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,839
trippy. Okay, this is this may make no

1745
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,640
sense to people watching. No, I'm loving

1746
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:43,440
it. Um I don't know when I had this

1747
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,040
thought.

1748
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,440
Maybe like maybe eight or nine years

1749
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,880
ago. I realized when I'm afraid I'm not

1750
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,079
breathing in completely and when I'm

1751
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,680
ashamed I'm not breathing out

1752
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,240
completely.

1753
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,920
True. So when I'm afraid

1754
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,839
yeah because huh any state of mind if it

1755
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:03,280
changes it directly affects your breath

1756
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,880
right which is very clear first first

1757
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,319
thing and this is all prea like this

1758
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,319
something I just bumped into when I'm

1759
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,760
ashamed

1760
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,200
it's on the upper side not on the lower

1761
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,480
side and so I realized there's something

1762
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,400
about the breath and uh this and that

1763
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,160
there was a moment in my life many years

1764
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,400
hence many years after this where I

1765
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,280
realized I had no instinct left anymore

1766
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,799
like I was so anxious so afraid and so

1767
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,039
thumbsick in a certain way had fallen

1768
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,880
into such a position. I would wonder I

1769
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,799
would ask my friends who were somewhat

1770
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,000
intuitive and spiritually inclined. And

1771
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,839
I was like, "Boss, I don't have an

1772
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,039
instinct. I don't know what to do. I

1773
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:37,599
have to think everything through and

1774
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,039
it's very tiring." And uh my friend, one

1775
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:40,400
of my friends, his name is Philip. He's

1776
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,839
a army veteran. He would be like,

1777
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,680
"Praer, you need to let go. You need to

1778
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:45,039
surrender." Like, "Boss, what is this?

1779
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,359
How do I let go? What am I holding on

1780
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,200
to? I can't tell." And he eventually

1781
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,880
said something. He's like, "Bro, the

1782
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,039
physical form of letting go or

1783
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,079
surrendering is breathing out." He says,

1784
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:57,839
"Just breathe out. Just breathe out." I

1785
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,400
have another friend who's a big fan of

1786
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:02,559
flow, who's a big fan of surrender. And

1787
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,640
his thing is, I don't keep me for him.

1788
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,240
It'll all work out. I'll just move with

1789
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,240
the way time moves. I'll just answer

1790
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,680
questions as they emerge. And something

1791
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,039
or the other shapes up. And it does for

1792
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,720
him. Life is much easier for him than

1793
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,200
anybody I know because he's just not

1794
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,880
bothered that much. Um, and so surrender

1795
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,680
is physically the act of breathing out

1796
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,520
and intellectually not worrying too much

1797
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,039
and letting life take its shape. This is

1798
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,480
what I've understood of flow and

1799
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,119
surrender. Is that Can we add one more

1800
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,640
thing? Yes. Also being constantly aware

1801
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,160
that I'm not the doer. Right. That that

1802
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,359
doing is happening to me. I'm not the

1803
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,440
doer. Yes. So I don't take credit.

1804
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:39,920
So if I'm not the doer, I will not get

1805
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,920
anxiety or heavy breath because I'm not

1806
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,160
responsible for anything. In such cases

1807
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,000
when you become aware, your actions will

1808
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,119
become

1809
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,119
spontaneously and spontaneous action

1810
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,799
that will happen that will be the actual

1811
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,400
flow. This is kind of what I meant by

1812
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:54,079
instinct. In that example that was

1813
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,960
spontaneous action. Then then you

1814
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,200
realize that you and the doors will

1815
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,559
open. It's very interesting also because

1816
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,720
this is exactly what Krishna is telling

1817
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,640
Arjun when he's anxious he's driving

1818
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,920
meaning out of self in the war and

1819
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,799
Krishna is like listen you're all just

1820
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,160
instruments of me. Yeah. Right. So

1821
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:13,599
coming back to that when you're holding

1822
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:15,839
the knife or you are killing me. If I

1823
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,839
know that you are an instrument then why

1824
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,359
should I worry about death? Right. So

1825
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,880
you so there is no worry about death

1826
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,920
because I there's a certain to be honest

1827
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,319
there's no worry about anything.

1828
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,000
We are making life complicated but this

1829
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,920
doesn't mean that I don't come I don't

1830
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,480
talk to you I'm not doing playing my

1831
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,799
role or when I go out I don't eat I'll

1832
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,720
do everything participate in everything

1833
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:38,319
but internally unaffected I'll tell you

1834
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,760
also I think what really happens I think

1835
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:41,440
worry and my are deeply connected

1836
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,680
because what happens is say I enter this

1837
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,839
room you enter this room from here you

1838
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,079
and I both um the first things we look

1839
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,280
at is what the microphone and the chairs

1840
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,400
because the chair is something I have to

1841
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,039
sit on the microphone is something I

1842
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,640
have to speak once I'm seated here of my

1843
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,000
field of vision. The most central focus

1844
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,039
I have is on you. There is a

1845
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,280
biocsychological requirement to focus in

1846
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,880
on objects in your environment to make

1847
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,559
sense of the environment. This room

1848
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,680
would be overwhelming and would make no

1849
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,440
sense to me if I didn't know I had to

1850
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,880
come and sit and talk here. If I take

1851
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,960
somebody from Sentinel tribe in the

1852
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,039
Anderman or the Laksh bring them here,

1853
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,359
they would not make sense of this. So

1854
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,079
our biology and psychology is programmed

1855
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:20,000
to for sensem. When that sense making

1856
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,599
goes in overdrive and tries to answer

1857
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,880
too many uncertain questions you it

1858
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:27,200
becomes worry. Now coming back to this

1859
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,480
whatever you are saying is true that

1860
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,319
preparation or that is required but in

1861
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,559
the mind the awareness should be there

1862
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:37,200
that the outcome is never in your hands

1863
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,599
you are free of the situation. Yes, I'm

1864
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,799
not saying go unprepared. Whatever is

1865
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,079
required is there. That is a part of

1866
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,880
life. You are in Maya. You're operating

1867
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:48,240
in Maya which is accepted. But the

1868
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,440
results is never in your hand. Bro, take

1869
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,559
let me believe that for a second, right?

1870
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,880
I I'll work with you. That is such a

1871
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:58,960
fearful feeling cuz I'm like wait, it's

1872
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,960
easier in a way I don't have to worry,

1873
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:06,480
right? Please. Identity crisis. Tell me

1874
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,480
more. I don't want to let go of my

1875
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:15,039
identity. My fear in all fairness is if

1876
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,319
that you're losing your identity because

1877
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,920
you're not completely letting go of

1878
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:20,240
things. Somewhere we want to stay in

1879
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,240
everything. That fear is coming. Fear is

1880
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,640
not that how good you are with your job.

1881
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,920
Fear is

1882
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,839
that subconsciously it is working.

1883
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,200
Because if I don't then am I lazy or am

1884
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:31,839
I not looking after things? Because

1885
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,760
that's genuinely the huh. No.

1886
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:35,440
It's so interesting and it is entangled.

1887
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,880
No. Yeah. Right. It is. It is entangled.

1888
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,520
Yeah. And you entangling it because

1889
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,319
again there is fear

1890
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:44,280
that what I'm saying is you're right.

1891
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:46,680
But

1892
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,520
conditioning that I will give my best

1893
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:52,720
result and more than that anything I'm

1894
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,319
doing I should enjoy. Automatically that

1895
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,240
enjoyment will be translated in your

1896
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:58,240
expression and the results will be given

1897
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,920
to you what you deserve. Nothing more

1898
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,160
nothing less.

1899
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,200
So why to worry? But at the same time

1900
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:08,319
I'm saying that oh brahman we call it

1901
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,319
the vdantic shuffle I call it the vantic

1902
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,680
you can move between layers of analysis

1903
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,599
at the top it means nothing but at the

1904
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,480
bottom it's no vantic shuffle here means

1905
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,479
that you know I am the self I am supreme

1906
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,600
human

1907
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:21,440
[Music]

1908
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,880
being that I am running away from my

1909
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,880
role right I'm running away from my

1910
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,640
duties. Sure. Right. So either you go

1911
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,400
this extreme or either you come in this

1912
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,880
extreme or you be in balance. Enjoy both

1913
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,880
the extremes. Be in balance. The middle

1914
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,960
part live in this world experience

1915
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,319
everything. Prepare yourself. At the

1916
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,679
same time be ready that results are not

1917
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,880
in my hand. Second time internally it is

1918
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:43,600
Maya. I'll enjoy the process. I'll watch

1919
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,679
the game. I'll play the game also. I

1920
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,480
will fall also. I will score also. But

1921
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,480
internally I know

1922
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,080
that then you're in balance and that is

1923
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,880
a perfect human being. There is a

1924
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,960
brilliant thing that um Goa G talks

1925
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,799
about in one of the days in his lecture

1926
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,480
have you said? I have done some other

1927
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:05,600
way in another way. Right. So Goka G

1928
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,080
talks about this story about his guru

1929
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,759
who Sai Ubakin and he says you know I

1930
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,880
realized from Saji Ubakin about how to

1931
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,080
get angry. We were talking about anger

1932
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,239
earlier. He's like this is what he would

1933
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,159
do. Saji would get super mad at

1934
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:18,640
somebody. He would go out and he would

1935
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:20,159
scold him scold him and just tell him

1936
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,600
how he's wrong and then he would walk

1937
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,759
back in the hut smiling be like go in

1938
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,839
car see what I did to him. And he was

1939
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,600
like he was so light about his anger. He

1940
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,719
realized the performance of it. And then

1941
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,400
there's a parallel thing I heard from

1942
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,880
Osho in one of his lectures. Rosho says

1943
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:36,239
he's like when you are crying be crying

1944
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,000
when you are happy be happy be become

1945
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:41,600
the thing itself and you will see it

1946
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,440
loses all power over you see was a great

1947
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,719
great intellect he had great experiences

1948
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,880
also but it was was so crisp people took

1949
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,880
it in other way altogether also so then

1950
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,560
another thing is as you mentioned

1951
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,239
talking to these great beings is another

1952
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,239
tricky game because what they see and

1953
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:57,600
what we infer is also a problem so we

1954
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,440
will infer things according to our state

1955
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,199
of consciousness sure sure that's a big

1956
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,159
problem. Sure, sure. Sure, sure, sure.

1957
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,159
Right. Right. No, I completely

1958
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:06,159
understand and think with with uh with

1959
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:08,719
somebody who spoke as much as Osho Osho

1960
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:11,280
did, there is a lot of space. Yeah. For

1961
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:13,440
miss and his commentaries or the way to

1962
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,960
talk are fabulous. Fabulous. No one can

1963
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,440
uh I think at least it's the most

1964
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,199
entertaining to listen. Yeah. I have

1965
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:22,159
realized on my journey that the great

1966
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:24,560
saints that I've met, they have a very

1967
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:26,239
not weird but a very different sense of

1968
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,520
humor. Quirky sense of humor. Quirky,

1969
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:29,360
very quirky. And they can change

1970
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,440
situations according to their will and

1971
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,440
the atmosphere also changes. But the

1972
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:36,239
sense of humor is very very different.

1973
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,679
In fact Swami Nityanandha the great he

1974
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,239
used to always sleep like this. He was a

1975
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,520
great sa he used to throw stones on

1976
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:42,880
people stone and people used to in the

1977
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,040
beginning people started talking bad

1978
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,560
about him what not what not. One day it

1979
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,640
is said he was sleeping like this and

1980
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,159
there was a big stone and her family

1981
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,480
came with a small girl who was

1982
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:54,320
completely paralyzed and they dragged

1983
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,400
her and got for her blessings and he

1984
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,560
threw a big stone on her. She felt

1985
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,560
unconscious. People started creating a

1986
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,560
chaos and all. When she woke up, she

1987
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,920
started

1988
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,840
walking. So we don't know how these

1989
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,040
great enlightened beings operate. They

1990
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,800
have their own ways to get things done.

1991
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,000
Very interesting. Many such great

1992
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,920
things. That is the reason it is

1993
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,280
important to have knowledge. Actually,

1994
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,960
it's a very interesting point because

1995
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,760
this could also become a good example

1996
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,679
for the u the mislication problem

1997
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,199
because you see the aesthetic of hitting

1998
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,920
a little girl with a stone is very

1999
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:27,600
radical and if this allows somebody who

2000
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,440
thinks he's a great being to pretend and

2001
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,120
go around and doing things they can fool

2002
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,800
a lot of people with this. So there is a

2003
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,040
mislication problem with you know I

2004
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,800
think there's a famous line um I'm not

2005
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,840
sure who said it is a finger that points

2006
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:43,440
towards God gets confused for God. Yeah.

2007
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:45,040
Yeah. Right. uh language is such and the

2008
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,800
way humans interact is such that the

2009
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,560
ultimate truth cannot be put into words

2010
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,120
and explained because the words become

2011
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,280
it as opposed to it being true you know

2012
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,560
a derivative of the words um and in that

2013
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,239
way I think there's a mislication

2014
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,960
problem with all spiritual wisdom is

2015
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:01,440
that people they sometimes apply a lot

2016
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,719
of their own interpretation yeah true

2017
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,920
that is the reason you're very right

2018
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,960
that is the reason knowledge is very

2019
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,199
important from where the source is

2020
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,040
coming at the same time again see very

2021
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,560
simple anything in life if When I'm

2022
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,320
saying knowledge, knowledge either bind

2023
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,080
you or liberate you. If you have this

2024
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,239
awareness all the time, you are in

2025
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,560
balance. Too much of knowledge without

2026
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:22,239
experience is also binding. And too much

2027
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,960
of experience without understanding what

2028
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:27,440
is written also problem. I think one

2029
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:30,480
very interesting facet in um which is

2030
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:33,440
accessible to our religious software to

2031
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:36,239
put it simply is the idea of Ras and

2032
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,440
Leela. Yeah. Which I don't think I've

2033
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:39,520
never really found a lot of other

2034
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,120
religions discussing this way. True. uh

2035
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,640
because other religions are framed as

2036
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:48,480
tests, complete tests of God, right? But

2037
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,239
the fact that this is divine dance just

2038
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,239
characters you know there is no test.

2039
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:53,520
Huh? You will know test. The more you

2040
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,840
walk on the path and the more you

2041
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,640
evolve, you will realize you know at

2042
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,760
point of time talking to you now when

2043
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:03,600
you look back few years back don't you

2044
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,840
think that there was a entire pattern

2045
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,000
that was set and beautifully everything

2046
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,760
was falling into place?

2047
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,840
I'm not sure if I feel that way. I just

2048
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,280
feel like it's random events unfolding.

2049
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,719
How? I mean I don't how random events I

2050
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,000
mean it's it's random in the sense I

2051
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,000
don't know how to decode if there's a

2052
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,360
pattern to it. It just happens. No, not

2053
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,920
a pattern but it was beautifully

2054
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,440
flowing. Not flow beautifully things led

2055
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,199
into each other so that your I have

2056
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,040
moments where I feel that that oh I

2057
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:34,000
didn't realize that significance of that

2058
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:36,719
is this. Wow. So at that time when you

2059
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,199
think something is wrong you crib you

2060
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,320
cry you whatever sulk in it but later

2061
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,679
years back when I turn around you

2062
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,560
realize that because of that I'm here

2063
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:46,400
today. It's yeah it's super accurate.

2064
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,320
It's super accurate. I had a very um

2065
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,080
catastrophic career killing moment in

2066
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,280
early on in my career and I felt so bad

2067
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,040
about it. I felt like I didn't even get

2068
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,640
a fair chance to represent myself. Now

2069
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,000
when I look back I know I can never be

2070
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,800
smitten by fame cuz I've seen the

2071
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,480
downside of it. That's it. I can I'm in

2072
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,560
so many ways immune to that poison. So

2073
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,400
the more you mature on the more the mind

2074
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,320
goes quiet you realize that there's a

2075
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,960
beautiful pathway given you just have to

2076
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,880
walk on it have no fear walk on it and

2077
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,320
even if you think you're falling that

2078
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,120
road will take you somewhere again it

2079
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,760
will take you high but again the ego is

2080
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,120
funny it takes over you know you've

2081
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,640
mentioned ego a couple of times too and

2082
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,080
I want to talk about ego I also want to

2083
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,679
get back to Leela and Ras because that's

2084
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,440
something I think if people understood

2085
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,960
their lives are going to be a lot better

2086
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:31,120
uh tell me about ego what is the ego and

2087
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,280
how does one spot

2088
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:36,480
I have this beautiful saying uh it is

2089
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:39,280
not ego it should be I go. The moment I

2090
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:43,040
goes you are completely good to go. That

2091
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:45,280
means the moment you think that I am in

2092
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,120
charge of everything and because of me

2093
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,640
everything is happening and I take

2094
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,400
credit for everything that is the

2095
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,239
biggest downfall on the spiritual path.

2096
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,719
Ego is important. So even in ego there

2097
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:56,320
are three eos

2098
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:59,920
satwa. So our goal is to get to satic

2099
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,159
ego. But before that also ego is very

2100
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,640
simple. The moment you take credit for

2101
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:06,640
anything you will have to pay for it

2102
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,800
because nothing is permanent. Every

2103
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,640
credit also has a downfall. The moment

2104
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,280
you realize that I'm doing it as an

2105
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:16,880
offering then you will evolve. So ego is

2106
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:18,719
not good or bad. But what is the worry

2107
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,400
point is the spiritual ego. That is very

2108
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,239
dangerous. That's probably the most

2109
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,320
dangerous. That is my point. So I'm not

2110
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:26,080
worried about ego because hey you need

2111
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,600
ego to sustain in the body also. If you

2112
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,280
don't have ego you'll go into some other

2113
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,560
to pass your exams you need ego because

2114
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,080
you need to believe you can do it like

2115
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,280
there has to be a concentration of self.

2116
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:37,840
Ego when channelized with awareness can

2117
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:40,239
give you motivation. Fair. But spiritual

2118
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,360
ego is very very dangerous and I feel

2119
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:44,560
like you probably meet a lot of people

2120
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,960
of that nature in your field. Uh because

2121
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,400
ya this is the last frontier of ego. The

2122
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,320
last temptation on the road to

2123
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,560
spirituality is thinking now I am

2124
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,719
spiritual therefore I'm better and now

2125
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,640
you've mixed the dirtiest part of the

2126
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,159
mind with what was an approach for the

2127
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,600
most positive part in your mind right

2128
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:01,360
that happens very often there's a very

2129
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,679
beautiful story there was a great being

2130
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,800
who was on the verge of getting

2131
01:16:02,679 --> 01:16:06,480
enlightened was almost there used to get

2132
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,080
glimpses or the flow or whatever you

2133
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,159
call it I don't want to name it or

2134
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,920
samadi or whatever he was there and all

2135
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:13,560
of a sudden he had a desire that I wish

2136
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,880
I was a

2137
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:19,199
butterfly he left his body He had a life

2138
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,199
of a butterfly lived for a few days and

2139
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,199
then he went to his final stage. So that

2140
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:25,679
means wherever there is ego, there is

2141
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:27,360
desire, there is want, there is greed.

2142
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,320
There's a new loop that completes and

2143
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,560
that spiritual desire is full of this.

2144
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,400
That is the most worry on the path. Ego

2145
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,440
you can't operate. The divine has given

2146
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:39,280
you ego to sharpen your intellect. It's

2147
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,040
like a razor that the knife used to cut

2148
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,560
the cake or kill someone. You decide. As

2149
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,480
a matter of fact, a litmus test for how

2150
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,400
real a spiritual speaker is to me,

2151
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,560
right? because I speak to so many is if

2152
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,159
I ask them about questions of ego and

2153
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,679
how humble the response is to the

2154
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,960
question of ego because I'm telling you

2155
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,400
as a matter I don't know maybe I'm

2156
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,080
intellectually not seeing this right but

2157
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,440
you cannot pass an exam without ego

2158
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,199
because you first need to believe that

2159
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,960
there is a doer who is going to do a

2160
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:02,560
thing and then he has to work towards it

2161
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,960
there has to be effort I can do it all

2162
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,199
these things have to happen I accept

2163
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,080
again with the

2164
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:09,440
understanding bind you or liberate you

2165
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,960
is up to you right right this is a

2166
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,760
performance knowing that this is a game

2167
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,000
I'm playing but this ego is okay

2168
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,679
spiritual ego Ego is the biggest

2169
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,679
downfall if you get entangled in that.

2170
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,560
Fair that is when you know you think

2171
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,560
that you are supreme higher than others

2172
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,960
or you know you get some occults or you

2173
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,960
that is another ball game. So this ego

2174
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,800
is okay. I'm talking about this ego

2175
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,480
where

2176
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,560
it is another thing boss you need to go

2177
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,159
to California to spot that. Have you if

2178
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,520
you go to there like people thinking

2179
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:41,600
they are I've done five I was so I have

2180
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,960
like it it it manifests in all these

2181
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,800
different ways and becomes blocker to

2182
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,960
transcendence. I have. So when I was

2183
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,120
talking about ego, you're talking to I'm

2184
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,400
talking about the spiritual ego. That I

2185
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,239
have knowledge. No, no, no. It doesn't

2186
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,920
belong to me. That is the reason putting

2187
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,920
Kali there is very important for me

2188
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,600
because she is the one who chop my ego

2189
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,600
off.

2190
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,280
Spiritual ego is dangerous. I think uh

2191
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,719
the the reason I asked you about ego is

2192
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,440
because it's a direct antithesis or

2193
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,120
rather the antithesis to ego is Leela

2194
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,880
and Ras and if you understand that this

2195
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,640
is a divine dance there is no way you

2196
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,000
can definitely that is reason why Khali

2197
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:16,520
comes in. Yeah. Interesting. Leela is

2198
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,080
something very beautiful. I think

2199
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,280
uh it's a change of

2200
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,280
perception. Either watch it as a ego

2201
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,040
game or trap or watch it as Leela.

2202
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,560
Right. Sure. Sure. Sure. Exactly. Those

2203
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,920
are the only two options you have.

2204
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,600
Either you get trapped in it and think

2205
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,040
this is personal. In fact, when you

2206
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,840
evolve on the path, you realize there

2207
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,600
are no option. Yeah. It just happens. It

2208
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,800
just happens. I feel you on that too

2209
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,239
because the grand way in which life

2210
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,360
unfolds is barely in your control. You

2211
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,120
have maybe like two degrees of freedom

2212
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,679
in a 100 degree of freedom game. Imagine

2213
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,840
if someone dies today that we both know

2214
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:48,400
someone dies today and we are not

2215
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,880
affected and we are okay. You have

2216
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:53,199
evolved so much.

2217
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,440
Yeah. Or someone you know that my job is

2218
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:57,040
gone or things are not doing good. You

2219
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,880
have understood that ego, spiritual ego

2220
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,400
everything and that is an experience

2221
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,840
that you're talking about and that is

2222
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,600
far greater than any book that you have

2223
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,520
read. Agreed. Then you have become an

2224
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,080
experiential being and that knowledge

2225
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,920
when it will talk you will be confident

2226
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:12,719
you will require no validation because

2227
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,400
you're living it right. Yeah. You don't

2228
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,840
have to defend it then because your

2229
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,280
truth after a while when you evolve on

2230
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,000
the path you will not even talk about it

2231
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,000
because you'll realize

2232
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:26,960
that there is a very famous story about

2233
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,760
the moment Gotham Buddha awakened. Um

2234
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,880
and when he awakened he

2235
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:35,440
realized that there is no point of

2236
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:38,000
speaking because people who know need no

2237
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:40,080
push and people who do not know will

2238
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,560
work with no push. And so 7 days he says

2239
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,800
silent he he he's he is of the opinion

2240
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,560
that this is it until the story goes on

2241
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:51,199
that many deities and dwas approached

2242
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:54,239
him said listen there are also people on

2243
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:56,000
the ledge on the boundary and only for

2244
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,239
the sake of those people if you spoke

2245
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,840
they will fall onto the knowing side

2246
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:02,000
then remaining on the unknowing side and

2247
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,920
that is what convinced him to preach and

2248
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,480
teach. Such an interesting way to look

2249
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,360
at the world you know um many people ask

2250
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:12,760
that what do you communicate with your

2251
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:17,120
guru what is there I think it's only

2252
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:20,800
silence because that what is unsaid in

2253
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:22,640
that space everything is communicated

2254
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,440
how often do you speak to your group I

2255
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:28,320
live with so you speak every day we talk

2256
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:31,199
it's that it's the communication is

2257
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,120
always there the leela is always there

2258
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,840
and when I do something wrong just by

2259
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:37,360
eyes I know that

2260
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:40,400
okay injection

2261
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:43,199
so you just know leelas are there right

2262
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,800
yeah and they crush your ego they'll

2263
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:47,040
crush it they'll crush it they'll crush

2264
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,440
it and only for your benefit they don't

2265
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:51,280
expect anything so actual guru plays a

2266
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,159
role because they have gone through it

2267
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,520
only when you have taken the road to

2268
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:57,199
faradhabad I know about how to take the

2269
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,040
road right exactly so they have taken

2270
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:01,840
the road to farabad they have come and

2271
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,560
now you're stuck somewhere they will 20

2272
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,560
ask a journey they'll make it 5 hours

2273
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,280
that is the reason guru is important and

2274
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,800
a constant reminder

2275
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,080
I know you don't generally worry about

2276
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,440
the future and I think I will have to

2277
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,719
pry this answer out of you in some

2278
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:19,360
different way but I'll ask you a direct

2279
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:22,560
question um where do you what do you see

2280
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,480
yourself doing in the future very good

2281
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,640
question because today morning I was

2282
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,880
asked this question in the cabal company

2283
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,040
what do you the cabal I was asking you

2284
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,400
was

2285
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,400
asking I said I don't know. And he

2286
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,159
laughs because he's like since 5 years

2287
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,679
I'm hearing the same thing, right? But

2288
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:40,239
things are happening. So I said let it

2289
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,560
happen because I have a very simple

2290
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:44,640
understanding not a philosophy

2291
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,400
practical. The day she wants I call her

2292
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,159
kali or the day whatever you call it

2293
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,320
doors will open and no one can stop it.

2294
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:52,400
The day she doesn't want nothing will

2295
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:55,520
happen. My duty as an instrument is to

2296
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,760
be fit fine doing in my best capacity

2297
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,159
and to show

2298
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:03,199
up. That's it. And you understand the

2299
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:04,880
capacity is to spread the word in some

2300
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:07,199
way. I don't know. No, you're a

2301
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,520
communicator. I hope I am. I think you

2302
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:11,520
are. If she wants I mean not talking

2303
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,719
that way but talking internally. Okay.

2304
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,880
There's an internal conversation you

2305
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,239
have right that's for the world outside

2306
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,679
for people that know Bhaves or people

2307
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,760
that watch this podcast and we'll find

2308
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:21,600
out about you. Um for them you're a

2309
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,840
communicator of ideas uh spiritual

2310
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:26,560
ideas. um ideas and these spiritual

2311
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,880
ideas are not like the the the Krishna

2312
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,639
Morti school of remove all abstraction

2313
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,560
and speak directly at the truth. It's

2314
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,960
it's a it's rooted in tradition. It's

2315
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,400
rooted in ritual. It's rooted in deity.

2316
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,080
So there's a specific identity the world

2317
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,600
gives you. Yeah. I don't know but I

2318
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,120
think practically what I'm going through

2319
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,440
my own experience is like you're making

2320
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,719
life very complicated. Don't segregate

2321
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,400
life that this is my professional life,

2322
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:49,280
my spiritual life. Take life as it

2323
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,800
comes. Put it together. We are humans.

2324
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,800
Bharat has given that knowledge how to

2325
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,600
become the perfect human being. Apply it

2326
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,960
at the same time don't run away from

2327
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,120
everything. A human being who's living

2328
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,800
in the mountains is not playing his role

2329
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:03,040
is not a perfect human being. Of course

2330
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,120
it is different when I say that suppose

2331
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,320
their karma will take wherever is but

2332
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:12,080
you know now this is a

2333
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,080
concept get followers become cool talk.

2334
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:20,159
No. The other end is stay spiritual, do

2335
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,760
material, right? It's this sort of and

2336
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:23,679
you will see this in the west popping up

2337
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,159
quite a lot also, but like this approach

2338
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,000
of becoming the modern monk. I once

2339
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,760
found a Instagram handle that that went

2340
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,520
the monk who bought his Ferrari. Yeah,

2341
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,120
that was I'm I'm genuinely I'm not

2342
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,040
making this up and it it it begs the

2343
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,719
question of like

2344
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,639
um then they just buy the Ferrari like

2345
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:41,520
drop the monk. Drop the monk. like why

2346
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:43,440
why marry them forcefully right so uh it

2347
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,840
seems like there's an insistence on drop

2348
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,920
everything and go this way or pretend

2349
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,040
like you got both the boats ridd so very

2350
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,320
good question because we get this

2351
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,440
question know you're spiritual you

2352
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,960
should uh doing this I have a very

2353
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,560
simple understanding everything in

2354
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,239
moderation is good fair simple keep it

2355
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,080
simple everything in moderation is very

2356
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:04,400
good now you should know what moderation

2357
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:06,400
is and again I come back to the basic

2358
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:08,159
because we are meeting for the first

2359
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:11,920
time it will either bind you or liberate

2360
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:14,159
It is up to you. Simple life

2361
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,920
in in in binding and liberation as

2362
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,679
concepts. How how does tradition and

2363
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,960
ritual play a part? Because it would

2364
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,960
appear that tradition and ritual would

2365
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,199
bind you. Of course. So it always binds

2366
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,800
you. So ritual if you're doing something

2367
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,159
it will bind you. It is a way but you

2368
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,239
should have that awareness that even

2369
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:32,719
after one day that ritual will stop

2370
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:32,719
because that see I came here in a

2371
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:39,120
cab free it has played its role and is

2372
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:42,120
there an importance to ritual in your

2373
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:44,239
worldview? Uh I think rituals are very

2374
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:46,560
scientific. It is not just offering

2375
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:49,280
flowers. It is not just praying and

2376
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,600
ringing bells. In fact when we do a puja

2377
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,520
which I've never we don't just giving

2378
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:57,679
you some ideas.

2379
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:59,440
We while offering flowers we exhale. So

2380
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:03,040
all the energy from the body is given to

2381
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:05,199
the dity. We take certain mudras we

2382
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:07,199
evoke that dity and when the puja is

2383
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:09,440
over the entire thing we take it back in

2384
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:12,159
the body because the dity is not outside

2385
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:13,920
the dity is inside. So rituals are way

2386
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:16,199
to remind you and keep you connected but

2387
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:19,520
eventually with time the ritual will

2388
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:21,440
also stop because it will happen

2389
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,800
constantly inside. So depending upon

2390
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,880
your sabha, depending upon your

2391
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,239
evolution, depending upon the guru's

2392
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,960
guidance, depending upon in what state

2393
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:31,560
you're operating, it changes. No, I I do

2394
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,400
understand rituals are

2395
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,960
a collective set of actions that make

2396
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:39,280
the unseen seen. Yeah. And people say

2397
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,000
that oh you're offering fruits to all

2398
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:45,080
the the daty takes that energy in subtle

2399
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,040
forms. So subtly everything is

2400
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,560
working. Now they're talking about

2401
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,400
energy and all but I think the great

2402
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,000
rishies knew it. the mudras that you

2403
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,639
take also. So it is completely

2404
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,920
scientific. What is this mudra? What do

2405
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,199
you think this is mudra? I've seen many

2406
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,880
people taking this mudra. What is this

2407
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,239
mudra? I just do not want to have my

2408
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,199
hands like this. So I start doing like

2409
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,639
this. It's a gun like that's I see

2410
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,920
people taking this mudra. I see people

2411
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,360
taking this mudra. I see people taking

2412
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,120
it's an awkwardness of the camera

2413
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,960
situation because see if I sit like this

2414
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,400
it's a very like different body posture.

2415
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,520
Somebody told me listen you open up your

2416
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,120
arms a little more. So I was like I'll

2417
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,239
just sit like this. This is people say

2418
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,480
channelizing this is yi mudra this but I

2419
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:22,560
believe you're doing this. Yeah. But if

2420
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,840
the mind is not aligned and you don't

2421
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,600
have the knowledge. Yeah. I don't have

2422
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,120
the knowledge. That's why I'm Yeah. So

2423
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,239
what is what am I what am I trying to

2424
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,920
channel here?

2425
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,520
Or maybe this like but what is this?

2426
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,520
Even this is a mudra. Even this is a

2427
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,480
mudra. This is a gang sign on the east

2428
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,639
coast. This is a gang sign. So when we

2429
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:43,280
talk about mudras no there's a perfect

2430
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:44,560
science to it. You need to be at that

2431
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,639
level. really need to channelize your

2432
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,719
prana, you need to do pranayam, you need

2433
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,639
to do shikar and then these will start

2434
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,320
working with proper mantras. Sure. So

2435
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,480
I'm just cutting it off because we get a

2436
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,239
lot of things that oh show me this mudra

2437
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:58,639
do this mudra. I avoid such topics

2438
01:26:56,239 --> 01:27:00,800
because there are two sets of people

2439
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,719
those already into it and they ask

2440
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,719
question is very different and that you

2441
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,080
answer because they require that push to

2442
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,520
understand knowledge and those are

2443
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,520
people who want to get there by doing

2444
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,000
anything. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right.

2445
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,639
Right.

2446
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,400
question because answer I get it. I

2447
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,920
completely get it. Um what I'm what I've

2448
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,600
realized from this conversation up until

2449
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,440
is really I think the grand lesson of

2450
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,600
this conversation um and what I

2451
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:27,040
understand of your your worldview is

2452
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:29,760
participate but don't drown participate

2453
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:31,840
in the world but remain of the constant

2454
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,239
awareness that this is participation. My

2455
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,880
language it is play the game but don't

2456
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:38,000
get married to the game right because

2457
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,960
you have to play multiple games. Because

2458
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,800
you have to play multiple games

2459
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,480
throughout life in the same moment. will

2460
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,679
make you play multiple games, right? Is

2461
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,719
there is there a is there a central

2462
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:49,040
lesson you'd like to pass on? Uh

2463
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:51,679
before talking about great spiritual

2464
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:54,960
talks or before getting into such be a

2465
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:57,360
good human. Appreciate others. Be gentle

2466
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,719
and work on jealousy and competition,

2467
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,239
you know. Yeah, that's a big one, huh?

2468
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,560
Yeah. For ambitious people, that's a

2469
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:04,000
huge one. Yeah. Let people do everyone

2470
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,360
has their own thing. Let them you do

2471
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,719
your thing. Yeah. Your greatest

2472
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:09,679
competition, your greatest jealousy

2473
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:11,760
should be how you evolve. And I think

2474
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:14,400
love and compassion is something which

2475
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:17,040
we are lacking. We are very selective.

2476
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,760
Selective convenience. I know Praar so I

2477
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,760
love him more. I don't know him so I

2478
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,239
won't love him more. You're out dude.

2479
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,280
You lost. So this is what we are

2480
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:29,360
lacking. Right. Um is there a question

2481
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:32,080
you have for me since I've been asking

2482
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:34,560
questions all this while? H I think you

2483
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:36,560
should start some practices. Okay.

2484
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,000
intellectual practices that was good for

2485
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:42,320
you like and I think just for you

2486
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,960
specifically just disconnect sit with

2487
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:47,280
yourself I think that vapasa has a great

2488
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,620
impact on you but don't take it

2489
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,159
personally I think you have to be

2490
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:55,520
[Music]

2491
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:58,320
consistent so do some you will enjoy it

2492
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:01,520
is a very beautiful um sh karma you gaze

2493
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,040
at the candle without blinking huh and

2494
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,120
how long and I think that your subver

2495
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,400
demands that so this is a personal thing

2496
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,159
I don't know it should come out but it's

2497
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,920
a personal thing shoot at me I'm I'm so

2498
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:12,000
interested look I took off my glasses

2499
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,920
tell me huh there's a for you it is

2500
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,040
coming of course because kali wants only

2501
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,719
there's a very beautiful exercise which

2502
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,440
you will enjoy it and it will give you

2503
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:23,360
clarity of mind also is a process where

2504
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:25,199
we take a dya mud muda keep it one arm

2505
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:28,199
distance at your eye level look into it

2506
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:31,600
without blinking for how

2507
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:31,600
long then start

2508
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:36,960
again but do Do it. Do it. You will

2509
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:39,360
realize a lot of things about your own

2510
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,760
self. Do it for good 6 months. Do it for

2511
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:43,760
six month you will enjoy it. That part I

2512
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,120
follow. Yes. So sit cross like or sit on

2513
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,159
the chair. But spine should be straight.

2514
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,000
Spine should be straight. So this is my

2515
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,440
dya for example. One arm distance right

2516
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,760
now. You keep your mic closed. I'll keep

2517
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,920
the di here. So at eye level at eye

2518
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:57,120
level. Yeah. Yoga and just look into it.

2519
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,239
Bus and breathe. Breathe normally. Let

2520
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:01,520
the body breathe in a dark room. In a

2521
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,040
dark room. In a dark room. So it has to

2522
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,880
be done at night basically. Basically in

2523
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:07,040
the dark and so say I'm doing this um

2524
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,880
I'm looking at this um and then my eyes

2525
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,400
blink I just start again. Yeah it will

2526
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,040
blink but later with time you'll realize

2527
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,040
that the eyes is not blinking it is open

2528
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,480
and then later you you'll realize many

2529
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,560
things but I don't tell you because the

2530
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,400
mind has the property to create things

2531
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,840
and it is said I I get that. Yeah. So

2532
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,719
then you message me and then you will

2533
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,480
laugh. Yeah. You laugh together. And is

2534
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:29,679
that a 30inut thing or a 1 hour thing or

2535
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,679
should I not think of

2536
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,840
it? It's okay. Blink open. Blink open.

2537
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,360
It's okay. But 3 minutes and then I'm

2538
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,520
done. Yeah. 3 minutes to say it is

2539
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:43,400
difficult for sit for 2 minutes. Yeah.

2540
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:45,520
Yeah. I know that. I know. I know. 20

2541
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:47,600
seconds then we'll see what to do. But

2542
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,600
start with this because you're not the

2543
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,120
type who's going to do rituals or mantra

2544
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,600
or not. That is not your vibe. No, your

2545
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:57,199
vibe is different. So then you do breath

2546
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:58,800
work. then then you'll enjoy. So first 6

2547
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:00,719
months you said 6 months is too much. Do

2548
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,639
it for 1 month then we'll get into I'll

2549
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:04,960
call you in 1 month. I I'll put my notes

2550
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:07,199
down in 1 month. Yeah. Then breath work

2551
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,040
will come. I I massively appreciate how

2552
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,120
uh straight up you are about that too. I

2553
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,960
actually don't mind that one bit. Uh I

2554
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,360
love that. Huh? But that is what it is.

2555
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,800
No, I agree. If a person likes it,

2556
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,719
doesn't like it, it's not my burden. My

2557
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,920
job is to tell. And you've you've told

2558
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,199
me from your spontaneity which I

2559
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,880
genuinely appreciate. Thank you so I

2560
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:24,480
think you'll enjoy it and you will

2561
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,639
realize the subtlest emotions that you

2562
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,639
were running away from. You will

2563
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,400
encounter it. Wow. And then the breath

2564
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:33,440
will come. That combination of breath

2565
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:36,239
and tratak is where your actual

2566
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:38,400
meditation or dhana begins for long run.

2567
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:40,400
Beautiful. Beautiful man. This has been

2568
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,920
a very enjoyable conversation. Yeah. I'm

2569
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,560
very grateful because it's a very raw

2570
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,320
conversation like you are very this is

2571
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:49,120
who I am outside inside. Yeah. Yeah.

2572
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:51,280
Yeah. So uh very spontaneous and yeah I

2573
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:53,040
just go I generally will carry this

2574
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,440
artifact because I sometimes have things

2575
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:57,360
written on it I never open it and every

2576
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,760
time it's closed I mean I've done and

2577
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:03,120
I'm glad that

2578
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:04,960
u it is um your experience that is your

2579
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,040
getting in together. Yeah, that is good.

2580
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,120
But thrat is a game changer. Try it. I

2581
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,360
am. Of course, breath and thrat together

2582
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,880
is a dynamite. But slowly, let's start

2583
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,159
one step at a time. One step at a time.

2584
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,280
I appreciate you. Thank you so much for

2585
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,320
coming. I'm going to see you again.

2586
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,520
We're going to have more conversations

2587
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:20,480
in the future. Very, very grateful.

2588
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,480
time. Thank you so
