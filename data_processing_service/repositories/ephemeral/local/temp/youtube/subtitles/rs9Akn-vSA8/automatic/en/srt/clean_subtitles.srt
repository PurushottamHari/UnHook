Thank you so much Bhaves. I have been looking forward to this conversation probably since I saw your first video on Instagram. Very grateful. I'll tell you why also because tell me if my understanding is accurate. I think the spiritual corpus literature the the religious tradition and ritual and deities and all this sort of history that we come from may not necessarily be a literal history. M I think the video I saw of you because it's been a few years was about either Ma Kali or it was about Shiv Shankar Maharaj and the way you had framed how to interpret them was very like I could touch it. I could feel it. It's not some distant deity. It was an understanding of the world that you'd offered through that symbol. Is that an accurate way of understanding? True. Because the fact is whenever you read something uh what is written by the rishies and what you interpret is something very different. Right. However, when you experience it and you talk on your basis of that experience, you will realize that what was written is true. So when you talk about daties or talk about anything, it is actually happening. So I think an above talks, experience talks. So you were saying that your life experience becomes easier to understand using that symbol. Intellectually no. Experientially yes. So first it starts with intellect that suppose we see Kalima holding something. It is intellect that she'll do this. But once you actually experience it, you will relate it. And how does one experience this? The best way to experience is work on the ego. Understand there's a greater energy that is working and work on the path. Walking on the path is like have discipline do sadena and knowledge is very important. Without knowledge nothing can happen. But excess of knowledge is also a problem because it'll become an obstacle. Yeah. So knowledge plus experience is wisdom. That is what we need and especially for our generation because we need evidence. We need logic mind and I think spiritual is very logical and experiential not fearing. I so I was giving you this background about myself before. Um I think my most unpoluted direct access into the spiritual world comes from my experience with vipashana right um the first time around I went as a silence challenge. But God deals you what he wants to deal you not what you ask right definitely. So I am in there saying can I stay silent for 10 days and like can I be alone for 10 days but what is happening inside of me is magic is waves is bubbles bursting and like good and bad painful and sad right all of that is happening and I realize because Goena G insists Genka G plays on a video because he's since passed and he talks about the experience you're having every day and he will say listen do not try to intellectualize this don't ask me questions about philosophy true I'm from a philosophy background I'm offended He's saying this he's like only experience and so day one I'm like what are you talking about don't talk about philosophy day two I'm like what are you talking about don't talk and slowly I'm getting milder are sir what are you saying till the day six comes and I'm like no no no experience is something completely different definitely and my education in the western cannon has not prepared me for understanding experience now I know that experience and intellect are different inside how do you explain it to somebody who does not see it is very very simple no we are living in a world of duality a active. Yes. Like what do you mean duality? Duality means wherever there is happiness there is sorrow. Wherever there is gain there is pain. Where is win there is loss also. We are living in this world and no one can run away from it. Fact. Even now at this point of you have everything. Next moment everything goes. No one knows what is going to happen. Acceptance. So you understand that life is like this. Now what happens? This is a space of intellect. Now when you understand spirituality it is a space beyond intellect. Experience is talking but it's not written in any book. And more than that every experience is unique. If we both are doing meditating we won't have the same experience. Agreed. Yeah. Initially bubble yoga white light but those are not experiences. Those are just mind going to higher whatever it is. Right. So everyone is unique. So that is a space where your sadna starts. So in the beginning it's all physical all repetitive. But once and six days you experience imagine you're maintaining that for one year. You'll be completely evolved. H and so the experience is me actually doing something and then from there a consequence emerging which is completely unique to me. Yeah. But beyond that also there's a state that is a very high state where you realize that um I don't want to call it samadhi because there are different types of samadi and that's a new term but there are states where you become a witness of everything. Witness of the happen stance of your life. Yeah. M you participate. See who was a yogi if you ask me I would believe a yogi or a very evolving as a person who has no expectations no desire no attachment but complete participation in the game of life no attachment but complete participation yeah that means he's also crying but at the end deep inside he knows that okay you know what crying is a performance yeah is a performance right internally I'm not this right so I'm cooking okay he's my relationship he's my brother but at the one of the one of the days he's going to die a temporary but internally you're established I It's a very high state of being. I then life becomes a game as you said. H right actually um my interaction with spirituality and philosophy and such and the way I I think actually everybody at the base of their mind is philosophical. Everybody has a operating system. This is my world view that people say right and my worldview comes from realizing this vipashna opened up for me is that see beyond all of what is happening inside I'm just silently watching and that door did not exist before that I didn't know because otherwise I was sad I was in the sadness I was sad I don't want to be sad but then I realized I could just step back and be like oh sadness is happening yeah of course and once that happened I think a lot of my opinions about life changed and I was like now if I'm playing a game I'm playing win or lose whatever mind and you're not judging your own game. You're not getting entangled in your emotions. You're watching it as a you know the beautiful phrase that all these are passing clouds. I'm the sky. Huh? So you know all this is passing lust, anger, desire. You are the sky. If you realize then you watch the cloud going you participate also in it but internally you're not shaken up. That is awareness. If you're aware about your existence okay but we drop down because it is difficult to maintain that state and once you maintain that state then you become a very highly evolved walking being on earth right why is it so difficult to maintain that state because we have been conditioned no for such a long time vanta calls it name and form we are so conditioned to give name and form to everything that is a conditioning we are just making you realize that okay there's something beyond that also right fair um I wanted to start my line of questioning by asking you uh how do you selfidentify do you think you are a teacher uh mistake what I think I'm just a small particle under Kali's feet that is my guru shv and kali and of course my guru also right very practically speaking fair of course I'm in the body when I talk to you okay bhavish is talking I can't talk like oh kali is talking people will throw me But internally, yes, that awareness is there. You are just a small particle, just an instrument in her hands. In Kali's hand, whatever she wants, she'll do. Is there a purpose to this instrument in Kali's hand? An instrument has no purpose. No. The duty of the instrument is to be fit, fine, active, and be at service. Right? Whatever Kali might. So, my duty is to look after my body, be aware, do what she wants, and that's about it. That's She does everything. My dear, who's rising the sun? Who's setting the moon? The sun and the moon never set or rise, right? But it is happening in this Maya. No, earth is rotating. No, there's one energy. If you understand the flow of that energy and if you surrender completely, you will realize that life is beautiful. Everything is taken care of. Your smallest needs are taken care of. H at the same time, what is not required is blocked by that energy only. So you call it sh, you call it shaky, you call it kali, you call it consciousness, you call it anything. Right? Is there a philosophy you have? Is there a intellectual thought you subscribe to? What is your method? Let me put it like that. My method of worship. Good question. Uh if you ask me as my guru says that I'm a mixture of uh vdanta and tantra. So I follow the philosophy and in fact on the spiritual path everyone follows this philosophy that we come from the same source. But the worship may be met different. Someone is into bi to gas into cup. So I think I'm a mixture of worshiping the gods also understanding that they are formless. That is my method and of course uh I think when you evolve on the path you realize that no matter what path you take all are connected they all play an equal role. Explain to me this uh path choosing how does one choose a path or is does the path choose you? Like how does this play? There are many things the path is actually determined based on your past sanscaras and kmas the past impressions that you're holding right secondly I think the first step of the path is to understand what makes you happy more than jumping into understand what is giving you peace of mind h so basic whenever someone is walking on the path or getting into this without a guru or without having start with asan pranayam ashtanga gate limbs work on that nicely automatically it will unfold and the desire to know the unknown should be And if you realize you talk to great saints or anyone, the first thing is the curiosity. It hits everyone. Everyone's curious. Everyone, everyone's curious. What will happen after these all basic question? It's everyone. That means already since you're born, you're walking on the path. I think that's in fact very profound coming from a psychological philosophical point of view. And this, you know, Hume famously said all addictions are low-level searches for God. True. Right. And if you look at anything for that matter, um men desiring physical connection, fe females desiring emotional connection, um people desiring substance, uh people desiring success, glory, fame, all of these are imaginations of self-trcendence that I will be beyond me once I have this. I will not I will cease to be imprisoned by myself. And so we keep chasing them to realize this is not it. This is not it. This is not it. And nati nati unfolds like this in your life. Beautiful. That is we practice every day nati. In fact I talk about natrii it's mentioned inad also very clearly. Now when you think suppose if you are running behind a car yeah you run you run you get a very fancy car you get one of the top models or whatever but nature is very amazing till the time you get it there'll be 10,000 models out there. Then again you want more. The mind is like this. Yeah we call it the monkey mind right? The mad monkey mind who's drunk all the time right? It never gets satisfied. No. So what I believe and understand is when the mind is under control, he's a best friend. When he's not, it's your worst enemy. Right. Worst in any relationship, worse than any problem because constantly it will just drag you into everything. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. So even the mechanism of this wanting more, you know, one can experience this. So suppose somebody's like I want 2 lakh rupees monthly salary then I will be happy. You will probably for 6 months then you'll start comparing yourself to everybody else who has two lakhs and then some more and then you want that and it keeps sort of keeping you loop like I wonder what happens between 20 and 60 in a person's life and it seems like this is what happens many loops same roller coaster this is the main teaching you know when we talk about uh dharum and earth the two goals of life is all our needs are taken care of never agreed we humans are so greedy we want to take take if you realize and Look at the world the small ant is also taken care even to this big bird or sun or everything that is happening but we just want want and I've seen people wanting also and after that they're not satisfied because mentally they are messed up completely why do you think people don't realize that this wanting is not going to cease why do you think I don't realize forget the word need take subject matter one like uh because I want I was telling you earlier I have material aspiration um I try to stay at best playing this game enjoying this game I even tell myself active ly when the game's not going my way material game. I enjoy this. Yeah. Because tomorrow when it will, I'll be like, "Oh, bro, this was such a bad time." Now, you know, you you have this. Why don't I, Himmanshu, the rest of us realize that this is not going to solve it? You tell me. How long would you play the game? Until I'm bored. I think boredom is a divine signal. How about after that? What? Something else. See, every game has a rule, right? If I ask you if you're playing football, one person is uh can run behind the ball but there are 12 people running behind the ball for no reason because that is the rule of the game. If you're talking about the game of life, have you understood the rules and regulation of the game of life? You'll never get bored because you will master life. Yeah, you become a victim of life. I'm bored. I don't know what to do. I'll find something else. You're not understanding the game. And that game will bind you to karma. And who will have to pay? You will have to pay. But if you have understood the game of life, you have understood how the rules of life or how nature works and that is the beauty of human birth. Tell me about these rules and regulations. It's a very interesting phrase. There are no rules as such. The rules are like of course there's law of karma. Sure. Explain to me because I want to understand your we talk about the four goals of life. If you have taken a human body, there are four goals of life. I'm sure you might be aware about it. That is dharm, earth, calm and mok. Yeah. The end goal of life is mok. Now I'm not talking about mok because in different schools Buddhism mok is different. Patanjali mok is different. Vanta mok. So leave it aside. Dharm is something very interesting that our generation needs very bad. If you understand how dharm works. Dharm is not a religion by the way. It is the law of cosmic nature. We call it the law of righteousness. And there are four important points. If you understand in this game automatically you start evolving. One is you should give your best in every situation and that is in your hands. For example, I'm talking to you now. I'm giving my best output. What will you think about me later? I don't care. None of my business. If I make that my business, I'm binded into the law of karma. So, giving my best. Second is anywhere you are placed 100%. Third is no judgment to anyone and anyone. And fourth is no expectation. If you are implying these, of course, the rules get higher when you evolve. But basic person who's walking on the path 100% in any situation being there I'm sitting here I'm thinking oh no what I'm going to do in education tomorrow out or I'm going to hyder out secondly 100% means you're there talking also with the person eye to eye understanding and building that kind is no judgment and third is no expectation means no fruits demanded in return fair this is very much like what Krishna is saying to practical this is that very yes very very practical but to apply it is very difficult It's very difficult. Very very difficult. Yeah. Something comes and just takes you. Yeah. Right. That you understand. In fact, when you start understanding this, the cosmic law will start supporting you. I have heard of this. I don't understand this but I have heard of this. So when I start understanding and I'm going, we call it the flow. You call it everything. Nature will start supporting you. The doors will start opening. You'll start getting help because you're walking with the current. If Gangama flowing and I keep a rock, I become the rock. I'm just going to damage myself and but if I flow I will meet the end path but that awareness should be there and that will only come when you do sadna. Now people talk about matri also that is earth uh cal k is desires earth is money earn money there is no problem make money do everything but keeping dharm in mind right and the end goal is mo right so you'll never get bored right because I know my goal is to not come back in this world again I if I come back not to be affected that is the reason mo changes so practically if I put it you just have to be a good human being first rather than anything else Right? Be nice. Mind your own business. Do your own thing. And your most um intense competition that you're going through is with your own self, not with others. That is what I believe firmly. I want to upgrade myself. If my sadness from A to B, I want to take it to A to Z. I don't care what you are doing. I don't care what he's doing. I want to evolve. That attitude is very important. Sorry. Whatever. I think it's a I some days I wonder right I'll tell you what I have a friend who is a type A very ambitious very driven type of person and funnily enough he gets what he wants he'll take its time but he'll get what he wants now for him in the experience what he feels in first person is I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying and I get it and then a new search begins whatever me who sees him intermittently I see him after 8 months he's gotten what he wants. And I'm like, "Oh, you were always going to get it." And then when he tells me about the struggle, I'm like, "A lot of this seems psychological that while you were going through it, you're having these conflicts in your head. Maybe this, maybe that, and in due time, you got what you wanted anyway. Maybe just drop the psychological conflict. Maybe just stop fighting internally. Maybe just dance with it and get to where you're trying to get to." He says if I don't have that conflict then I will not get what I want. I tell him because you have that conflict you think getting what you want is harder than what it is because you what are you feeding your system until I fight until I wrestle with reality it doesn't appear. So when you get it you feel like it's a consequence of wrestling with reality. Now I don't know what school of thought is right. What what do you think? My point of view is totally different on this. See your school is right where you think that just flow semi flow or flow whatever you call it. My thing is if I want this glass of water, it is my duty to give my best and work towards it. That means I'm free mentally, right? I get it. If I get it, I cherish it. With that awareness that is also temporary. If I don't get it, I know that there is something better and I will get what I deserve. On the spot, you're free of everything. You're relaxed. M that person that you're talking is mentally so messed up because he's not enjoying life right in this situation also I'm enjoying that beautiful sunrise I'm watching manga I'm enjoying talking to you right fair and what can you do you think you are in control your duty is only one thing to give your best in every situation so maybe as a wife as a husband as a brother as a sister as anything that you take that is my belief and it is not my belief in fact it is in Gita it is in every text it seems I think even even uh when you said I participate in the world. Um I think there is a Gita it's Gita only there's also in the Bible something very literal about it. Be of the world but not part of the world or something like this. There's a whole biblical code. So like this is a very understood spiritual very simple. Now if I jump into tantra and all then things change then tantra has you have to worship or into your sabha your behavior. So they're different. The beauty of sanatan is so clear that depending upon your behavior you worship God. There is no one way. Yes, there is no one way university level. If you like to your curiosity, you do vata. You enjoy it. You'll reach god your way. If I like to do worship, I like dies. I'm chantra as my way. If my sister likes to work karma yogi, everything is on that is her way. Everyone has their own ways. No. No hard and fast rule that if you don't take this you'll be punished, right? Doesn't work like this. So, so vanta is the same as ad vanta or vanta right which is nonuality. That is known that is the highest teaching once actually it is a teaching that is required to get in day-to-day life to have a good state of mind and to operate. Explain that teaching. Um also with vanta I'll explain one more thing. Vedanta is very dangerous also because then you don't participate in the game of life. You think that everything is Maya I am Brahman and then you just become lethargic and again you come into tamas. Yeah you you said a lot of words. Yeah, I want to understand your grammar. No, no, no. I I completely understand. Um my my serial question is what is ad vanta? What is tamasra? Okay, this vanta is a topic which I can talk about years and years. But uh let's make it simple. Ad vanta ad means non-duality. Okay, there are two there are many schools in vanta also but I'm just talking about adw because I think that is what people need to practically apply in life. School of non vdanta is the end of vedas which is upanishad. So when you read nowadays it is impossible to read V. So I would recommend read the oponyishad start with base to get into knowledge texture knowledge and everything. Now how does adanta work? Have you heard about Einstein? I'm sure you have. Yeah. What he said he said something very interesting that um everything is relative nothing is absolute. That means in simple language on its own nothing is value. It is interdependent to have value. Sure. So but what Vanta says only the absolute is reality rest everything is Maya that means a source if you understand that source you will understand the entire consciousness entire world and everything for example let me get it more practical I'm sure you aware that the world that you see is upside down right oh because of the light reflection sure yeah the brain flips it sure yeah saying it is Maya isn't it true that the first image in my eye is upside down And then the brain flips it. But the world is straight. Yeah. But it is my only. No. Sure. Sure. I understand. I understand the metal. Yeah. It is my only. So the rishies are saying that I will just talk about it and I'm asking you only as if you're sitting. I'm trying to explain vanta. I'm asking you a question. What is constant in your life? Nothing. The most. Yeah. I mean the fact that it is me who is looking I think nothing else is just 2 minutes you said that past has changed completely. Your body is changing completely. Yeah. Yeah. Everything is changing. Then what are you running behind? Mhm. Then what you said part I'll get bored. If you know it yourself is not constant. Then why are you running behind it? You'll never be satisfied because the human mind is always craving for a constant flow of ecstasy. Right? Which is the highest state and that is your birthright. You think that praar you're doing this podcast or traveling the world or meeting Bhaves is your goal. No. Something you'll crave more. That is the rishies decoded long time ago. Then again they went to a very simple question that if you say that you're you're the body and this time is existing is this world a reality? So they came up with a second question. I'm making the open very simple. So they're asking what is reality? Because many people ask you are you know I'm touching you up to real or you know I'm awake now everything is real. So the answer is very simple. They are saying the three states of consciousness that every human being goes through. The first is the awake state. I'm awake now. But they have also answered this beautifully. Reality is that which never changes. H this is what modern science is not able to crack it. Now reality is that which never changes. That means if I say I'm awake till I die I should be awake. It is not possible I'm going to sleep. Second is a dream state. In your dream you get multiple dreams. That is also changing. And deep sleep is something if you go in deep sleep you lose awareness. That is tamas actually. So reality is what which never changes. So what how they answer this beautifully is saying there's only one reality that is pure consciousness. If you get tap into that or if you experience that what is changing is Maya. Fair. Fair. So that is in a nutshell. Of course it goes in detail but it's not touch it will be too much. I see. Have you ever encountered somebody who is at that level? Yes. Many? Not many. Constantly operating in that state. Very few. Very few. Very few. Are they marketkedly different from other humans? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How? They don't care. They don't care. They're not like us who want to come talk about. Of course, their roles also differently plays. But yeah, there are people now also. I believe. Are they more common than we might think? They are very common. They are very common. In fact, you don't realize he met a great saint who was lying on the floor. We were in Sri Shalam and um sitting and like literally I should not say this but literally begging. But when we went to him and he started speaking it was something. How do you know what is the symptom? I think the more spiritually evolved you come to know who's genuine and who's not. Sure genuiness is one thing but in reaching that state there you come to know I think sad tells you come to know and is more than that also that uh how much you have worked on yourself to understand them genuine people are there in fact uh great rishies like Ramanamarishi Turji they were all in that state I yeah I mean I I'll give you a primitive more approximate example I have always felt and it might sound biased. It is not. I have always felt my mother is very special in this way because in 30 years of being around her, I have never seen her heavy in her energy. Speaking in a very vague language here and what I effectively mean is almost nothing traps her. Then she's free. And I keep saying this privately, never to her directly. I I think she's not many lifetimes away. Yeah. It's very distinctly unique from other people in her family. I think very distinctly unique from other people in my family. It's very unique about her and it's just an instinct I have. I may be completely you know like this should be a private grammar whatever but there's something I can sense there. M um I it that made me wonder if there has to be more people walking around normal consciousness that are much more you know more than sorry I'm cutting you more than that I believe no you might be a great saint I will not come to know because at that state of consciousness you can pretend you become very good actors but only staying with the person you will come to know how deep are they enlightened or in higher states or how they're pretentious that you come and you know people are Not stupid. People come to know everyone has you picked up. You have that instinct. You're staying with her. You have seen her. You have studied her. Very rarely have I found somebody who's just light. Yeah. Like when we live with a guru, she is amazing. Like she's 86 now and um she's just amazing. Never have seen her, you know, losing balance any point of worst of the worst scenarios. And even when she is angry, it is an act to teach me something. Anger as a tool as opposed to anger as a state. Yeah. But inside, I'm sure she's just laughing and all. Why? Because the next second she's okay. Nothing has happened. You were so spot on. I've had to learn this which is see if you're doing things and your anger is but natural. How are you not angry after you're done with anger? Such an important trait cuz you could hang up the phone and laugh. Yeah. And I've seen it doing her like I because I've stayed with her for so many days and she is cutthroat. If you if you are wrong she'll make you realize and once you have learned the lesson she is like nothing has happened but you can't be normal because again the mind is playing games. So that shows that there are people who are very and you know love joy or being you know very collective required that is the experience of their sad and that is their so it is not just reading the books or intellectually they have experienced it and I think that the source of unconditional love there is no judgment fair no judgment about do someone is doing wrong okay let them do poor thing doing let them come out but the lessons are given I think that is the role of a guru also. They play multiple and very difficult to decode them. Very difficult. They are different different situations. How is it that you led yourself into this situation or how does life led you here into this situation? Because see, I mean, I'm curious. Um, I'm using myself as patient just so that it's easier. And at a certain point, I swear to God, I've had an instinct. I maybe need a guru, right? Uh, but one, I thought if a guru, I need a guru, the guru will appear, right? Like if if I'm ready for it, it should automatically sort of begin to happen. I don't know where to go search for one. Um, as a very unique thing that you ended up with a guru because a curiosity emerged from you. Tell tell me a little bit about that. I think um meeting the guru in this life is I'm not that capable. It is a past sanscaras of course you know it but uh the thought should be there to know the unknown how you're passionate about it like you know I want to crack this I want to go that it so I think getting a guru is not that easy in fact the guru knows it a very highly evolved guru enlightened guru knows it everything about the disciple then constant connection but the disciple should be ready and in fact it is not the advantage of a guru a guru a will not come like this they will test you they will grind you but an enlightened guru is that guru who will tell you that I'm not your guru your guru is inside you if you have met such a person who unconditionally loving you not expecting anything and making you realize that you are that truth that is a good what do you think of somebody like a J Krishna Morti in that way oh he was a fabulous uh man what intellect he had what intellect he wasn't dealing with deities metaphor he has different philosophies no Different ways, different path of understanding but adant regards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely definitely in fact his talks are very difficult for people to understand also like Shri though people don't understand what he's talking but they if you know and you have experience then you can crack it he was a great uh narrator great I'm sure he had some great experiences you think he was in the state is is that conversation about in your circles very we have we have conversations about what he writes how he decodes but I think we to talk about without staying with him is very difficult very difficult very difficult I personally believe now I've stayed with My guru I stayed with many gurus I know about them at the same time you met people also we know that they're not there or but you come to know h interesting so u I understand ad vant as and this is my understanding from speaking with somebody like an achar pashant for that matter and such ad vant is fairly intellectual um you can nati ni your way to that point you know not this it's not that and I mean this is what I suggest people I had this insight maybe a couple years ago that we do things in this life form to be done with them. True. And I say this to people and it's not instinctive or intuitive to them. I say for instance, it's a comical example a 14year-old boy when he looks at his peers and say they have facial hair. You really want facial hair. It's a very common male thing where like you run a razor once it happens you don't care about it. Yeah. the first time somebody's going to have physical intimacy. Before that, there's a lot of anticipation. And if you look at a 45 year old man and maybe there's no physical intimacy in his life and he just does not care. And so the first Mercedes is one of those examples for the luxury. I want to have my first luxury car once it happens. And so you keep doing these things to eventually realize it's not this, it's not that. None of these actually serve a purpose. You keep moving towards a transcendent place and and hopefully you arrive. That's virant. I understand that is human birth is full of experiences. No. Yes. And each experience reveals itself as nothing. No. No. Each experience will either evolve you or bind you. Explain this to me. This binding thing. So that means now you said my first experience of getting a merc. Okay. You are talking based on some experience. Okay. Now you're happy with it. But there's someone like you after merc wants a beamer whatever it's binding him. Right. So every experience either bind you or liberate you. It's very subjective. Oh, very interesting. And depends over individuals. Very interesting. I don't think so. Now you're telling me that intimacy someone had an ex someone is behind it. It will do again again again. But someone is like so this is the beauty of human birth. No. Super interesting. My point of view this was it's done. Like for instance fame um it appears very quickly in my profession. Yeah. Accept it. Now you're saying you're done. I'm like whatever fame right like okay but someone like you may want more I think wants to do more she wants to do more more more but you're done but then you'll go for something else so that means that means you're evolving right so coming at the peak then you think okay so you're in that rat race but you said now I want to do something else so that experience will either evolve you or bind you that is completely very subjective interesting I just always assumed that the natural progression towards would be towards letting go. That is only in your case. It might be or I might be just blindsided to my own insufficiencies also. I'm very huh I understand that. Very good. Um this is adant and you said you're a mix between adant and tantra. Tantra is something uh see nowadays whenever I've heard about tantra people are thinking that tantra is kalajadu it is that people won't no tantra is not like this. In fact, it is a higher science. When you understand tens talks about in simple language, not going technical terms, it is expansion of consciousness. It makes you realize that you're beyond this body, mind and intellect which leads to vanta only. Eventually everything eventually will come to Bhagat Gita of the first three chapters vanta tantra. The last experience that the dvta becomes one and you become omniciently present that is vanta. You take karma yogi everything is biant everything comes but the parts are different. for a karma for a tantra they're getting in very simple language they have defined three behaviors a person who satic I'm sure you know what satic is you just do me a favor and explain regardless I want to understand your worldview okay so I'm putting it very simple for a person who's new to tantra sure not getting into dtal or getting into that ritualistic part which was very hectic tantra has three simple factors if you understand tantra there are three kinds of disciples or people who are worshiping in tantra one is the satic bhav who is intellectually strong does all satwa one is ratik who's already running running running running running running running and one is tamik who's very lethargic and lazy so in tantra there are different methods given that they all go beyond satwa raja and tama and experience the formlessness so a satwa would be given a method that takes him beyond satwa and beyond rajas also so like yeah same like bhagat gita sure same like it comes to so tantra is very simple but when you go dwell into deeper aspects of tantra tantra is yantra mantra Ra tantra yantra is the form mantra is the sound yantra mantra tantra is the final end meeting of everything. So when I say praar praar is the mantra for example you are the form and when comes to the conclusion it is tantra taking everything above so in that we have mudras we have to do a lot of sadna worship gods there's a different way so every path has different way so I don't know where people are getting worried about tantra but it's very simple in fact any puja you do even offering coconut is tantra any worship that you do is tantra huh but depends is it Right hand or left hand. Now going into a bit detail. Sure. The right hand saddak is all satic people. The left hand sadic with the sadic change of yard may eat alcohol. So depending upon your sabha you worship god because in sanatan there is no hell or heaven. Hell or heaven is in our mind. Simple. So you're saying that tantra is effectively this self-trcendent aspect that emerges from expanding your consciousness. Yes. The goal is to expand our consciousness. How does what what does expanding your consciousness mean and how does one do that? So okay what I explained previously about tantra was just an just not even like taking you to the candy shop and all just showing you outside expanding the consciousness simple term is that making you realize that you're beyond this punchima buddhas the five senses the the punchabhas are earth fire elements five elements we think we are this body we are not then making you realize that beyond the senses also we have 11 senses we are beyond that also and making you realize that only in the human body you can experience That is sense which is greater than sex, greater than food, greater than sleep and greater than jealousy, anxiety, fear. So in tantra it is said a person who capable of not getting entangled between food, sleep, sex and fear is capable of doing higher sadhana. So these are the four things that we have to first be aware and move ahead of it. At some point I think I came across some texts in Buddhist tantra which I'm assuming would be very different from Hindu. When you talk about viganov tantra, Buddhist chantra, they are similar but the forms and the worship is a bit different. Right. And it spoke of something called the higher method and the lower method. The mahayana and right and uh the descriptions in the text I were reading were very radical. Um so I I think if I remember correctly it said something about how the tantric Buddhism is a highway to enlightenment as opposed to your regular stuff which is it'll take its lifetimes and you have to do very revolutionary things like maybe eat feal matter and there were suggestions of this nature that I didn't completely understand or could make sense of is that am I remembering correctly or you're talking in a right way but even in tantra as we dwell into deeper aspects there are different paths also given where depending upon your sabha you take the path like a path of an aguri or path of a person living in swashan or many many ways in that imagine a state let me be very very simple imagine there's a state where you are not affected by anything in the world maybe fal matter maybe diamond maybe having anything in a from the dusbin because you have come to realization that everything is divine mother if you are into that state you have become a siddha so there are methods also taken there aa so those methods exist for a certain sabha certain sabha not for everyone not for everyone but I feel like it's very hard for somebody to selfdeiper all like I think a guru is then very required in something because who's going to reflect and tell me what so you know we call tantra I tell this all the time because I personally believe that tantra is walking on the razor's edge you're walking on the razor's edge one side is the value of ego and other side is a value of desires but that razor's edge is a shortcut so that shortcut to cross anoguru otherwise you will be messing up completely. Have you seen people messed up from this kind of stuff? I I have met few people. Yes. Yeah. They they get mental hallucinations. They start getting uh Yeah. They get messed up. That is the reason the guru takes you back to reality saying that no, don't get entangled. Your goal is going beyond the consciousness this limited. Yeah. Because I've read a lot of these people who will have clear symptoms of psychosis talk about how their condalini is messed up also. And that's a very common internet trope. If you go to/ini or whatever you find a lot of these people and I wonder what's happening there. See I don't know people talk about kin very very very casually kini awakening is not for everyone once you're kin awaken you're not the same. Yeah that's what I to be honestly I avoid I run away from such topics because these topics are so beautiful so experiential and nowadays people have just destroyed it. They've made it snacks. They have made it snacks and I think uh any anyone Tom Dick and Harry goes easy. Huh. any Tom Dick and Harry that I can awaken or third chakra. It doesn't work like this. It doesn't work like this. In fact, great gurus they all had a all of them. I'm sure in their own methods. So no matter what path you take a you take bi you take karma but if you talk from vantic point of view is Maya doesn't exist everything is Maya. So depending upon your sabha again sad should be done. Interesting. Interesting. explain to me uh this idea of agoris also because I think during the makum this sort of picked up a little and like it's very hard to explain somebody who's not native to this land what agoris are you know we were very fortunate to live with the um agoris and the nagas in the kum this time and they are very gentle people they are very they're doing their own thing so I don't know why there is so much misconception that the nagas are like this the aguris are like this I think they're very happy in their own world they don't want actual agura They don't want name. They don't want fame. In fact, I met a great Aguri was very well spoken in English. Traveled the world, seen everything and then took the path. I used to live in a kapal and his English was fabulous. His experiences were fabulous. But you would not realize very simple man. How is an agori different in their swabhawa or they an agori? There's a very beautiful phrase. Know what is day for a normal being is a night for aguri and what is night for people like us is day for agori because they are sad starts in the night and actual agur will never leave the cremation ground his home is that h he will die live eat everything there only and then if he wants to go to another cremation ground he'll move in the night only and no publicity nothing they don't want what is the what is the ration that is their sabha that is their sadha that is their journey In fact, we met at met a very interesting agur baba in Kashi also very well spoken very simple and he just said love is everything unconditional love without judgment you see divine mother everywhere and everything are you in that state he asked I said I'm praying that one day we get there he just started laughing why because he said you're walking on the path don't lie to me so they are aware and they're very simple and what they show on TV what are our just I it's a dramatized it's a dramatizer yeah right it's dramatized way. Of course, their practices are intense. In fact, in auror, there are practices where you go in the smashan and you're in a certain stage of evolution where you have to walk and not look behind. So there are practices with the but the guru is very important. So I think these things should be left only under the guru and the shasha and it is not meant for us. They walk through fire. They walk through fire. You know they walk through the swashan guard and there are entities that call you and all be but it is said that it is meant full of esoteric what needs to be done and you know even a swashan they do sadna many many things in fact there's a very beautiful story of an auror where uh he was a great enlightened being I can't recollect his name but uh he was a siddha born enlightened and he goes to swashan to do sadna and then there is this so-called entity it's a story not reality but make us realize so there's There's one entity that comes and tells him, "What do you want? I'll give you everything that you want. Everything. Tell me what you want. You want name? You want fame? You want power? What do you want?" He's sitting. He's sitting. He said, "Please don't bother me. Let me meditate. I'm here for my sad." Again, next day he goes in the night. She comes to him. Tell me what do you want? I will do this. I I'll take you to top of the world. This happens for a month. Then that great Siddha is tired and he says, "You know what? I have hepatitis on my right leg. Move it to my left leg. Free. I don't want to get entangled." M that is the state of an evol being that's a funny story. Yeah. So when you go into auror and you have a right guru the guru will make you realize you may get supernatural powers you may get name you may get fame you don't want that you want is the essence of god. I was recently in an interview um where I was the guest and they were talking to me about love and they were talking to me about forms of love that men have as opposed to forms of love that females might have. And it kind of felt like this could enter a tricky territory for public conversation. Um and I was trying to explain to them I said something along the lines of if you want to see the way a man loves watch him weep his beloved at the funeral at the cremation ground. Right? If you it's a genuine experience. Uh two of my close friends are twins. Um they lost their father recently. I woke up one day I got a text is like last week um boys lost their father come to the cremation ground and I was standing there and it's a surreal experience. It's a surreal experience being at a cremation ground. You watch 60 plus years of memories being burned down true by the children of the person who's passed in for the purpose of making their memories immortal. It's a very weird thing. You watch them cry but you also watch them relieve themselves. It's a range of emotions. It's you getting perspective on your own life. You realizing how quick and fast and meaningless all of this is if you don't wake up. Um and I think one of the best ways to enter into spirituality is to spend a day in a shamshan. Yeah. True. That is what the first teaching of agur is. When he met the aguri he said if you think you're so um smart come to the smashan and see you will see that everything is nothing is permanent. In fact my guru whenever I used to get up and down in my sad she used to tell me bes whenever you go to a smashan you forget everything but the problem is when you come out you forget the smashan and again you get entangled that is so true right yeah and who's a person who's evolved who's always in balance he enjoys everything but at the same time he knows everything is temporary that is a very highly evolved being according to me there was a very interesting experience in my last vipashna um it was a very painful one I think much more painful than I was ready for or like be when I came out and people were like how was it I was like if I tell you you won't go so don't ask me but it was an experience after 7 8 days of intense agony one day something burst open pavish I don't know what happened it's it's the afternoon walk I'm having it and suddenly pure ecstasy just flowing through me every step I took boom just blasting into happiness is I can when I think of my family just pure pleasure emerges. When I think of all my work or like my friends or like the anything I thought of it's just pure pleasure right and in that I'm aware that this is going to pass and I was like what a strength to have built up that I'm experiencing such joy but completely aware it's maybe 20 minutes or 2 hours or 2 days at rest. Imagine maintaining that state and consciously being in that state. It's so difficult to explain cuz I would touch a leaf and I was like what? This is so beautiful. It's so different from my normal waking consciousness. I can't explain it to somebody. I can't even go back at choice. It is not meant to be explained. It is only between you and the experience. Right? That is the beauty because words can't get it down. And I think uh it is the birth right that we have to stay in that consciousness at least I think everyone gets it you know at some point yeah unaware I think it's more prominent when you're a kid to feel that way and it just fades over a period of time uh I think it was sguru who mentioned to me about or it was satya I'm not sure which one said living by memory and living by experience is two different modalities what happens is you grow up and all this is memory so your drive back home is shorter because it's all memory you don't experience the road anymore the way you used to and uh more than that the older you get the concept of time changes drastically. Yeah. It becomes shorter. You've psychologically lived half your life by the age of 24. Of course. How old are you? 24. Yeah. Your half half of your life is done with bro. Can you believe it? It is such a shocking fact that by 24 your half your memories are already made. That is the reason. No. In one birth we are living multiple lives. You said that earlier. Explain it. Explain it for me. You know we were talking earlier. You said childhood was different. Now it is different. And with time you don't even realize how you were 10 years ago. Yeah. Right. And I believe every day we are changing. Every day we evolving. Again it is very subjective. Either you evolve or you get in the trap is up to you. And I think when you experience such higher states of consciousness you don't need anything. Then food, sex, drugs, nothing matters because you have tasted the nectar of life and you want to be in that state you can't get there because you don't have knowledge. Fair. So knowledge is very important. Right. Right. Have you have you experienced something like this? I am nothing to experience anything. No, but like I mean temporarily have you experienced like a state of ecstasy or bliss. Beautiful states. Beautiful state. But again, no, it's very uh dangerous because so much ego and pride I think it is his Yeah. Yeah. It is not mine like I didn't I didn't produce it by anyone. Everyone experiences it. Everyone and once you get that state or that kick or that taste you know beautiful saying no after tasting honeyole enjoy white sugar. Fair. Yeah. That is a state. Um do you generally answer a question like what is a good [Music] death? I think um we die before dying. What do you mean? That means there is so much fear of loss in our head. As we grow older, we are already dying every day. I think nobody ever told me that with growing older what will emerge that did not previously exist is my past. Because when you were there's nostalgia that consumes your mind. But suddenly one day you old enough to have nostalgia. And you wish for that as much as you wish for this the future and the past. For a long time the only struggle in my life was my future. Now I also deal with my past. Yeah. And at the same time again your future and again my future and then my past and it keeps moving like this. And uh there's a very famous line from Randi future like it ends up being like this. You know if you ask me about death it's a personal thing. I think every night when I go to sleep I just pray because I don't know next morning if I'll wake up or not. So I think we die every night. Sure. Because I don't know what tomorrow is holding. Right. At the same time I think death is something which is never in our hands. But if I know that I'm not this body and this is all Maya, then I'm dead alive doesn't matter. Sure. But I mean, would it really not if I brought a knife near you? Would you not like flinch and be like, "Oh, what are you doing?" Like, if I pulled a knife right now, see, human instincts will come. Yeah. But if I'm supposed to survive, I'll survive. I mean, that know if I've said this often and I've spoken about this with almost all spiritual conversations I do because here's my antithesis. Okay? And this is my lesson from the limited spiritual history I've read that are you tell me you know you're a enlightened person you put together a bunch of people around you who learn from you this is the way history has worked Jesus did this Buddha did this you know great rishies have taught people when they came to eventually what happens is the ingroup comes in conflict with the outroup somebody says not you and then you know there is conflict and even your most spiritual self does not survive a political conflict because if somebody picks picks up a knife, you have to defend yourself. You can't answer material threat with spiritual power. No, no. See, first thing is um there are two aspects to it. I'll give you another example which will connect to this. I know someone very strange somewhere. He tried to do suicide. [Music] Still moving still at it at it at it everything at it. Right. And he wanted to die. Interesting. Now, how is that possible if I ask you? I mean, I I He wanted to die. Yeah, he wanted He did many things. He did many things. He had rat poison also. Maybe he's incompetent. Like he had rat poison also and survived. Huh? How do you justify this? The desires to die then he gave up and now he's doing very good in life and he's very grateful that that didn't happen. So what I infer is there is some karmic bond and no one can run against that. If a time of death has come, you will die anyhow. Heart attack say and if that time of death has come by you stabbing me, it is going to come. I may be an enlightened being. I may be a stupid man. I may be a dumb man. I'm going to die. This is my understanding. But if my time of death has not come then even after stabbing I will survive. No but the odds change drastically after and before being stabbed. After stabbing your chances of surviving are lesser. But that is a karmic bond. No. So you saying you are willing to gamble your life on your karma. Who I'm willing to gamble in this point of time if you ask me and I know people will not accept it. The knife is Kali. The man who's stabbing me is Kali. So why should I worry? So you my faith is so strong and if I talk about surrender and I'm in complete surrender. I know then what's it to worry? Okay. So let me pay. But I'm not stupid that so you will negotiate with me like hypothetical I I pull out a knife and I'm like body reflex will work. Yeah. No. Yeah. That will happen and then I'll be like bhish I'm going to stab you. Will you try and convince me to not but why will you stab me? First question will come in my heart like logically I'm talking like you are right. Huh? Suppose I I you are in a dark part of the town and I'm trying to rob you and after I'm done robbing you seconds you will come in I'll just be in that scenario if you're talking yeah yeah I mean I use the example more broadly what I'm trying to say is suppose there is incoming physical harm from somebody wants to beat you up will you try and negotiate your way out it's there's a very fine line between spiritual and being stupid I will not be stupid yes agreed That's exactly what I want. Huh. Yeah. So you will you will try and be like so I'll talk to N me eventually. Right. Sure. I'm not Superman that. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Yeah. And so the the spirituality which is the Yeah. But while dying I'll have no regrets. While dying I'll have no fear. That's and while dying I'm already free in this world. So what that is going to take away from me? That is the question I was asking about what is a good death. No fear, no this this is the answer I was looking for. Okay. Okay. Okay. Fair fair. So even if I go I get a heart attack, I have no fear because I'm not dying. Only the body is dying. And so do you wonder where the attention the awareness the cons consciousness go? Is that part of your depends upon how you have lived your life? The way you have lived your what's your age? I'm sorry. I'm 29. 29 of years of years you have lived will determine the moment before you die. If you're attached to something that thought will be running to you. Agreed. And that will determine your death. But in my case there's no regret. I was born by her will. I'll die by her will. Simple. And what people will cry for one year people think on my birthdays eventually they'll forget that also. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody die and pass. Yeah. Right. No one cares. What matters is how I have lived. the quality of I have lived the memories of the sadness that I have and how much I've evolved that is what matters in my case for me very subjective do you and I have done justice to my life or not do you wonder if because see this is a great answer to the question I want to die with no fear because I wonder if at what you feel at the point of death I am asking you one thing yes please when you are born we celebrate everyone's birthday you celebrated your birthday my birthday when I'm when I'm dying when I'm dying why are People are crying because there is fear of unseen. Exactly. So why should I worry about unseen? I wonder if there is at least a slight cause of celebration at death. I think life is meant to be celebrated even when you are born, not born or even after death. Entire life is celebration because everything is Maya. No. How can you forget the basic principles? Tell me. Fair. Yeah. Right. So at least there is and especially somebody who's lived completely. If you say worldly responsibility, somebody who's done that, somebody who's late 90s, hundreds, who's done a full life, at their death, there should be at least slight cause for celebration. I don't know if it's a radical idea. In fact, you know, when people die, this may sound very strange, but if I see someone is dying, I am sad because the the sad for the family, but happy for the person because he's free from the misery, right? What happens after death? Of course, there's a full literature on it, full gut pura, everything. But at the m in fact I think what death according to me is living in anxiety, fear, jealousy, constantly cribbing, crying. You're in death, you're not living and life is very short. Live moments, experience, breathe. How old are you? I am 36. Um, I feel very old in front of you by the way now. Maybe my questions are very childish. Maybe that is why. Um, yeah. Yeah. No, I mean I think you come from a very wise or if not wise, a very curious spot. Maybe that's a humbler way of putting it. Like you've actually put your money where your mouth is and your time where your desire is and you've gone after looking for these things, trying to understand the unknown, trying to see what you can make sense of and then you know you you're a very humble communicator of it as well. My dear, I'm nothing operator. She does everything. The fact that she wants me if she will not let me in also. And people say that oh it's an imagination talking to Kali and all. So those who know know those who don't know they don't need to know. Explain the experience of talking to Kali. Oh she's then what happens? You close your eyes and you can hear her. She's in everything. No. Uh if you think that okay I'm not talking about higher states. Normally if you think that one day she's going to come and tell you oh you're not praising very rare when you're a very evolved being. But you know for normal people like us she will open doors help you someone will come and help you some direction will come automatically some flow she's always around but the problem is you don't want that what she's giving you want something else only she's giving you a nice house but you want that 1050 building flows building which is not meant for you the smaller will appreciating but once you realize that small house will give you everything in return that is where the flow of surrender comes yeah so and it seems like a very interesting part of your philosophy Because I'll tell you what, I'll give you my honest feedback. Right? This is a it's a it's a conversational issue very often with people from the spirituality is because their worldview is it it's without this and without that ni in a way right like I am nothing is something that you would expect somebody who's on the spiritual path to say no no no no why no why is it no no why you are nothing but that doesn't mean that you don't operate no no of course of course what I'm trying to say is it becomes very difficult to have a conversation yeah yeah that is very Right? Because so I have to sort of pull out an answer because please very they will dedicate everything to Radha and at that point how do I ask a question and so like that that sort of accept it because you know it is important because now when I'm talking to you I also being very aware that oh I know so many things is my downfall so I offer it to generally I'm not vocal about it but I'm being vocal because you feel like you'll I'll understand. Yeah. Yes. And I think you are a curious man to actually apply it also somewhere. Right. And I'm humble enough to be like my point of view does not matter here, right? And I'm really understanding your point of view also because that curious point is very important. So it is balancing back and forth but generally when we talk outside I said okay you are the king you be the king your life your ship your rules do whatever you want it is not my place. But now we're talking because I think it is required. Right. I I I completely understand. It's a it's a very interesting sort of bent to have to life as well. Um but when I I asked you a question earlier on which is what is your philosophy and I'm realizing with a man like yourself it's harder to get the answer directly what I come to realize after about 20 30 40 minutes of talking is that a large part of your philosophy is surrender. I think uh you know everyone talks about surrender bi it is very very difficult very very difficult because I think uh it is very easy to say that I leave everything in the hands of Bhagwan or Kali or Shiva Shakya and everything but surrender can only be possible when you have elements of gan and karam together and imagine where you are in a state where you don't take any credit at the same time you don't take any downfall and you know there's someone looking have to just leave it in their hands. both easier but in situation if you do that and you're aware about it in Bhagat Gita beautifully you know sitta there's a man a man with a steady intellect no matter what happens intellect is very steady if you are in that steady intellect you are evolving that is the first step of bacti so everything you're do and in fact bi also gets difficult when even in my enemy I see divinity fair right so they're evolving if you have experienced such states and that time if someone is yelling at you or someone is doing something wrong and you've realized oh he's doing it ignorance I should just pray for them you know softness you have kindness towards yes then compassion compassion will come that's compassion is a you know a great enlightened or evol being has two important traits uh one is humbleness second is compassion right um to go back to my question I was asking what does surrender look like what does it feel like how does how does one do it how does one practice this in daily life how to put it in simple language um you want me to try Yeah, I have an amateur version of all of these things, right? Like I have a grammar for this because I I'm a collector of experiences and I'm a writer of thoughts. Um I think there are two states. This is very trippy. Okay, this is this may make no sense to people watching. No, I'm loving it. Um I don't know when I had this thought. Maybe like maybe eight or nine years ago. I realized when I'm afraid I'm not breathing in completely and when I'm ashamed I'm not breathing out completely. True. So when I'm afraid yeah because huh any state of mind if it changes it directly affects your breath right which is very clear first first thing and this is all prea like this something I just bumped into when I'm ashamed it's on the upper side not on the lower side and so I realized there's something about the breath and uh this and that there was a moment in my life many years hence many years after this where I realized I had no instinct left anymore like I was so anxious so afraid and so thumbsick in a certain way had fallen into such a position. I would wonder I would ask my friends who were somewhat intuitive and spiritually inclined. And I was like, "Boss, I don't have an instinct. I don't know what to do. I have to think everything through and it's very tiring." And uh my friend, one of my friends, his name is Philip. He's a army veteran. He would be like, "Praer, you need to let go. You need to surrender." Like, "Boss, what is this? How do I let go? What am I holding on to? I can't tell." And he eventually said something. He's like, "Bro, the physical form of letting go or surrendering is breathing out." He says, "Just breathe out. Just breathe out." I have another friend who's a big fan of flow, who's a big fan of surrender. And his thing is, I don't keep me for him. It'll all work out. I'll just move with the way time moves. I'll just answer questions as they emerge. And something or the other shapes up. And it does for him. Life is much easier for him than anybody I know because he's just not bothered that much. Um, and so surrender is physically the act of breathing out and intellectually not worrying too much and letting life take its shape. This is what I've understood of flow and surrender. Is that Can we add one more thing? Yes. Also being constantly aware that I'm not the doer. Right. That that doing is happening to me. I'm not the doer. Yes. So I don't take credit. So if I'm not the doer, I will not get anxiety or heavy breath because I'm not responsible for anything. In such cases when you become aware, your actions will become spontaneously and spontaneous action that will happen that will be the actual flow. This is kind of what I meant by instinct. In that example that was spontaneous action. Then then you realize that you and the doors will open. It's very interesting also because this is exactly what Krishna is telling Arjun when he's anxious he's driving meaning out of self in the war and Krishna is like listen you're all just instruments of me. Yeah. Right. So coming back to that when you're holding the knife or you are killing me. If I know that you are an instrument then why should I worry about death? Right. So you so there is no worry about death because I there's a certain to be honest there's no worry about anything. We are making life complicated but this doesn't mean that I don't come I don't talk to you I'm not doing playing my role or when I go out I don't eat I'll do everything participate in everything but internally unaffected I'll tell you also I think what really happens I think worry and my are deeply connected because what happens is say I enter this room you enter this room from here you and I both um the first things we look at is what the microphone and the chairs because the chair is something I have to sit on the microphone is something I have to speak once I'm seated here of my field of vision. The most central focus I have is on you. There is a biocsychological requirement to focus in on objects in your environment to make sense of the environment. This room would be overwhelming and would make no sense to me if I didn't know I had to come and sit and talk here. If I take somebody from Sentinel tribe in the Anderman or the Laksh bring them here, they would not make sense of this. So our biology and psychology is programmed to for sensem. When that sense making goes in overdrive and tries to answer too many uncertain questions you it becomes worry. Now coming back to this whatever you are saying is true that preparation or that is required but in the mind the awareness should be there that the outcome is never in your hands you are free of the situation. Yes, I'm not saying go unprepared. Whatever is required is there. That is a part of life. You are in Maya. You're operating in Maya which is accepted. But the results is never in your hand. Bro, take let me believe that for a second, right? I I'll work with you. That is such a fearful feeling cuz I'm like wait, it's easier in a way I don't have to worry, right? Please. Identity crisis. Tell me more. I don't want to let go of my identity. My fear in all fairness is if that you're losing your identity because you're not completely letting go of things. Somewhere we want to stay in everything. That fear is coming. Fear is not that how good you are with your job. Fear is that subconsciously it is working. Because if I don't then am I lazy or am I not looking after things? Because that's genuinely the huh. No. It's so interesting and it is entangled. No. Yeah. Right. It is. It is entangled. Yeah. And you entangling it because again there is fear that what I'm saying is you're right. But conditioning that I will give my best result and more than that anything I'm doing I should enjoy. Automatically that enjoyment will be translated in your expression and the results will be given to you what you deserve. Nothing more nothing less. So why to worry? But at the same time I'm saying that oh brahman we call it the vdantic shuffle I call it the vantic you can move between layers of analysis at the top it means nothing but at the bottom it's no vantic shuffle here means that you know I am the self I am supreme human [Music] being that I am running away from my role right I'm running away from my duties. Sure. Right. So either you go this extreme or either you come in this extreme or you be in balance. Enjoy both the extremes. Be in balance. The middle part live in this world experience everything. Prepare yourself. At the same time be ready that results are not in my hand. Second time internally it is Maya. I'll enjoy the process. I'll watch the game. I'll play the game also. I will fall also. I will score also. But internally I know that then you're in balance and that is a perfect human being. There is a brilliant thing that um Goa G talks about in one of the days in his lecture have you said? I have done some other way in another way. Right. So Goka G talks about this story about his guru who Sai Ubakin and he says you know I realized from Saji Ubakin about how to get angry. We were talking about anger earlier. He's like this is what he would do. Saji would get super mad at somebody. He would go out and he would scold him scold him and just tell him how he's wrong and then he would walk back in the hut smiling be like go in car see what I did to him. And he was like he was so light about his anger. He realized the performance of it. And then there's a parallel thing I heard from Osho in one of his lectures. Rosho says he's like when you are crying be crying when you are happy be happy be become the thing itself and you will see it loses all power over you see was a great great intellect he had great experiences also but it was was so crisp people took it in other way altogether also so then another thing is as you mentioned talking to these great beings is another tricky game because what they see and what we infer is also a problem so we will infer things according to our state of consciousness sure sure that's a big problem. Sure, sure. Sure, sure, sure. Right. Right. No, I completely understand and think with with uh with somebody who spoke as much as Osho Osho did, there is a lot of space. Yeah. For miss and his commentaries or the way to talk are fabulous. Fabulous. No one can uh I think at least it's the most entertaining to listen. Yeah. I have realized on my journey that the great saints that I've met, they have a very not weird but a very different sense of humor. Quirky sense of humor. Quirky, very quirky. And they can change situations according to their will and the atmosphere also changes. But the sense of humor is very very different. In fact Swami Nityanandha the great he used to always sleep like this. He was a great sa he used to throw stones on people stone and people used to in the beginning people started talking bad about him what not what not. One day it is said he was sleeping like this and there was a big stone and her family came with a small girl who was completely paralyzed and they dragged her and got for her blessings and he threw a big stone on her. She felt unconscious. People started creating a chaos and all. When she woke up, she started walking. So we don't know how these great enlightened beings operate. They have their own ways to get things done. Very interesting. Many such great things. That is the reason it is important to have knowledge. Actually, it's a very interesting point because this could also become a good example for the u the mislication problem because you see the aesthetic of hitting a little girl with a stone is very radical and if this allows somebody who thinks he's a great being to pretend and go around and doing things they can fool a lot of people with this. So there is a mislication problem with you know I think there's a famous line um I'm not sure who said it is a finger that points towards God gets confused for God. Yeah. Yeah. Right. uh language is such and the way humans interact is such that the ultimate truth cannot be put into words and explained because the words become it as opposed to it being true you know a derivative of the words um and in that way I think there's a mislication problem with all spiritual wisdom is that people they sometimes apply a lot of their own interpretation yeah true that is the reason you're very right that is the reason knowledge is very important from where the source is coming at the same time again see very simple anything in life if When I'm saying knowledge, knowledge either bind you or liberate you. If you have this awareness all the time, you are in balance. Too much of knowledge without experience is also binding. And too much of experience without understanding what is written also problem. I think one very interesting facet in um which is accessible to our religious software to put it simply is the idea of Ras and Leela. Yeah. Which I don't think I've never really found a lot of other religions discussing this way. True. uh because other religions are framed as tests, complete tests of God, right? But the fact that this is divine dance just characters you know there is no test. Huh? You will know test. The more you walk on the path and the more you evolve, you will realize you know at point of time talking to you now when you look back few years back don't you think that there was a entire pattern that was set and beautifully everything was falling into place? I'm not sure if I feel that way. I just feel like it's random events unfolding. How? I mean I don't how random events I mean it's it's random in the sense I don't know how to decode if there's a pattern to it. It just happens. No, not a pattern but it was beautifully flowing. Not flow beautifully things led into each other so that your I have moments where I feel that that oh I didn't realize that significance of that is this. Wow. So at that time when you think something is wrong you crib you cry you whatever sulk in it but later years back when I turn around you realize that because of that I'm here today. It's yeah it's super accurate. It's super accurate. I had a very um catastrophic career killing moment in early on in my career and I felt so bad about it. I felt like I didn't even get a fair chance to represent myself. Now when I look back I know I can never be smitten by fame cuz I've seen the downside of it. That's it. I can I'm in so many ways immune to that poison. So the more you mature on the more the mind goes quiet you realize that there's a beautiful pathway given you just have to walk on it have no fear walk on it and even if you think you're falling that road will take you somewhere again it will take you high but again the ego is funny it takes over you know you've mentioned ego a couple of times too and I want to talk about ego I also want to get back to Leela and Ras because that's something I think if people understood their lives are going to be a lot better uh tell me about ego what is the ego and how does one spot I have this beautiful saying uh it is not ego it should be I go. The moment I goes you are completely good to go. That means the moment you think that I am in charge of everything and because of me everything is happening and I take credit for everything that is the biggest downfall on the spiritual path. Ego is important. So even in ego there are three eos satwa. So our goal is to get to satic ego. But before that also ego is very simple. The moment you take credit for anything you will have to pay for it because nothing is permanent. Every credit also has a downfall. The moment you realize that I'm doing it as an offering then you will evolve. So ego is not good or bad. But what is the worry point is the spiritual ego. That is very dangerous. That's probably the most dangerous. That is my point. So I'm not worried about ego because hey you need ego to sustain in the body also. If you don't have ego you'll go into some other to pass your exams you need ego because you need to believe you can do it like there has to be a concentration of self. Ego when channelized with awareness can give you motivation. Fair. But spiritual ego is very very dangerous and I feel like you probably meet a lot of people of that nature in your field. Uh because ya this is the last frontier of ego. The last temptation on the road to spirituality is thinking now I am spiritual therefore I'm better and now you've mixed the dirtiest part of the mind with what was an approach for the most positive part in your mind right that happens very often there's a very beautiful story there was a great being who was on the verge of getting enlightened was almost there used to get glimpses or the flow or whatever you call it I don't want to name it or samadi or whatever he was there and all of a sudden he had a desire that I wish I was a butterfly he left his body He had a life of a butterfly lived for a few days and then he went to his final stage. So that means wherever there is ego, there is desire, there is want, there is greed. There's a new loop that completes and that spiritual desire is full of this. That is the most worry on the path. Ego you can't operate. The divine has given you ego to sharpen your intellect. It's like a razor that the knife used to cut the cake or kill someone. You decide. As a matter of fact, a litmus test for how real a spiritual speaker is to me, right? because I speak to so many is if I ask them about questions of ego and how humble the response is to the question of ego because I'm telling you as a matter I don't know maybe I'm intellectually not seeing this right but you cannot pass an exam without ego because you first need to believe that there is a doer who is going to do a thing and then he has to work towards it there has to be effort I can do it all these things have to happen I accept again with the understanding bind you or liberate you is up to you right right this is a performance knowing that this is a game I'm playing but this ego is okay spiritual ego Ego is the biggest downfall if you get entangled in that. Fair that is when you know you think that you are supreme higher than others or you know you get some occults or you that is another ball game. So this ego is okay. I'm talking about this ego where it is another thing boss you need to go to California to spot that. Have you if you go to there like people thinking they are I've done five I was so I have like it it it manifests in all these different ways and becomes blocker to transcendence. I have. So when I was talking about ego, you're talking to I'm talking about the spiritual ego. That I have knowledge. No, no, no. It doesn't belong to me. That is the reason putting Kali there is very important for me because she is the one who chop my ego off. Spiritual ego is dangerous. I think uh the the reason I asked you about ego is because it's a direct antithesis or rather the antithesis to ego is Leela and Ras and if you understand that this is a divine dance there is no way you can definitely that is reason why Khali comes in. Yeah. Interesting. Leela is something very beautiful. I think uh it's a change of perception. Either watch it as a ego game or trap or watch it as Leela. Right. Sure. Sure. Sure. Exactly. Those are the only two options you have. Either you get trapped in it and think this is personal. In fact, when you evolve on the path, you realize there are no option. Yeah. It just happens. It just happens. I feel you on that too because the grand way in which life unfolds is barely in your control. You have maybe like two degrees of freedom in a 100 degree of freedom game. Imagine if someone dies today that we both know someone dies today and we are not affected and we are okay. You have evolved so much. Yeah. Or someone you know that my job is gone or things are not doing good. You have understood that ego, spiritual ego everything and that is an experience that you're talking about and that is far greater than any book that you have read. Agreed. Then you have become an experiential being and that knowledge when it will talk you will be confident you will require no validation because you're living it right. Yeah. You don't have to defend it then because your truth after a while when you evolve on the path you will not even talk about it because you'll realize that there is a very famous story about the moment Gotham Buddha awakened. Um and when he awakened he realized that there is no point of speaking because people who know need no push and people who do not know will work with no push. And so 7 days he says silent he he he's he is of the opinion that this is it until the story goes on that many deities and dwas approached him said listen there are also people on the ledge on the boundary and only for the sake of those people if you spoke they will fall onto the knowing side then remaining on the unknowing side and that is what convinced him to preach and teach. Such an interesting way to look at the world you know um many people ask that what do you communicate with your guru what is there I think it's only silence because that what is unsaid in that space everything is communicated how often do you speak to your group I live with so you speak every day we talk it's that it's the communication is always there the leela is always there and when I do something wrong just by eyes I know that okay injection so you just know leelas are there right yeah and they crush your ego they'll crush it they'll crush it they'll crush it and only for your benefit they don't expect anything so actual guru plays a role because they have gone through it only when you have taken the road to faradhabad I know about how to take the road right exactly so they have taken the road to farabad they have come and now you're stuck somewhere they will 20 ask a journey they'll make it 5 hours that is the reason guru is important and a constant reminder I know you don't generally worry about the future and I think I will have to pry this answer out of you in some different way but I'll ask you a direct question um where do you what do you see yourself doing in the future very good question because today morning I was asked this question in the cabal company what do you the cabal I was asking you was asking I said I don't know. And he laughs because he's like since 5 years I'm hearing the same thing, right? But things are happening. So I said let it happen because I have a very simple understanding not a philosophy practical. The day she wants I call her kali or the day whatever you call it doors will open and no one can stop it. The day she doesn't want nothing will happen. My duty as an instrument is to be fit fine doing in my best capacity and to show up. That's it. And you understand the capacity is to spread the word in some way. I don't know. No, you're a communicator. I hope I am. I think you are. If she wants I mean not talking that way but talking internally. Okay. There's an internal conversation you have right that's for the world outside for people that know Bhaves or people that watch this podcast and we'll find out about you. Um for them you're a communicator of ideas uh spiritual ideas. um ideas and these spiritual ideas are not like the the the Krishna Morti school of remove all abstraction and speak directly at the truth. It's it's a it's rooted in tradition. It's rooted in ritual. It's rooted in deity. So there's a specific identity the world gives you. Yeah. I don't know but I think practically what I'm going through my own experience is like you're making life very complicated. Don't segregate life that this is my professional life, my spiritual life. Take life as it comes. Put it together. We are humans. Bharat has given that knowledge how to become the perfect human being. Apply it at the same time don't run away from everything. A human being who's living in the mountains is not playing his role is not a perfect human being. Of course it is different when I say that suppose their karma will take wherever is but you know now this is a concept get followers become cool talk. No. The other end is stay spiritual, do material, right? It's this sort of and you will see this in the west popping up quite a lot also, but like this approach of becoming the modern monk. I once found a Instagram handle that that went the monk who bought his Ferrari. Yeah, that was I'm I'm genuinely I'm not making this up and it it it begs the question of like um then they just buy the Ferrari like drop the monk. Drop the monk. like why why marry them forcefully right so uh it seems like there's an insistence on drop everything and go this way or pretend like you got both the boats ridd so very good question because we get this question know you're spiritual you should uh doing this I have a very simple understanding everything in moderation is good fair simple keep it simple everything in moderation is very good now you should know what moderation is and again I come back to the basic because we are meeting for the first time it will either bind you or liberate It is up to you. Simple life in in in binding and liberation as concepts. How how does tradition and ritual play a part? Because it would appear that tradition and ritual would bind you. Of course. So it always binds you. So ritual if you're doing something it will bind you. It is a way but you should have that awareness that even after one day that ritual will stop because that see I came here in a cab free it has played its role and is there an importance to ritual in your worldview? Uh I think rituals are very scientific. It is not just offering flowers. It is not just praying and ringing bells. In fact when we do a puja which I've never we don't just giving you some ideas. We while offering flowers we exhale. So all the energy from the body is given to the dity. We take certain mudras we evoke that dity and when the puja is over the entire thing we take it back in the body because the dity is not outside the dity is inside. So rituals are way to remind you and keep you connected but eventually with time the ritual will also stop because it will happen constantly inside. So depending upon your sabha, depending upon your evolution, depending upon the guru's guidance, depending upon in what state you're operating, it changes. No, I I do understand rituals are a collective set of actions that make the unseen seen. Yeah. And people say that oh you're offering fruits to all the the daty takes that energy in subtle forms. So subtly everything is working. Now they're talking about energy and all but I think the great rishies knew it. the mudras that you take also. So it is completely scientific. What is this mudra? What do you think this is mudra? I've seen many people taking this mudra. What is this mudra? I just do not want to have my hands like this. So I start doing like this. It's a gun like that's I see people taking this mudra. I see people taking this mudra. I see people taking it's an awkwardness of the camera situation because see if I sit like this it's a very like different body posture. Somebody told me listen you open up your arms a little more. So I was like I'll just sit like this. This is people say channelizing this is yi mudra this but I believe you're doing this. Yeah. But if the mind is not aligned and you don't have the knowledge. Yeah. I don't have the knowledge. That's why I'm Yeah. So what is what am I what am I trying to channel here? Or maybe this like but what is this? Even this is a mudra. Even this is a mudra. This is a gang sign on the east coast. This is a gang sign. So when we talk about mudras no there's a perfect science to it. You need to be at that level. really need to channelize your prana, you need to do pranayam, you need to do shikar and then these will start working with proper mantras. Sure. So I'm just cutting it off because we get a lot of things that oh show me this mudra do this mudra. I avoid such topics because there are two sets of people those already into it and they ask question is very different and that you answer because they require that push to understand knowledge and those are people who want to get there by doing anything. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. question because answer I get it. I completely get it. Um what I'm what I've realized from this conversation up until is really I think the grand lesson of this conversation um and what I understand of your your worldview is participate but don't drown participate in the world but remain of the constant awareness that this is participation. My language it is play the game but don't get married to the game right because you have to play multiple games. Because you have to play multiple games throughout life in the same moment. will make you play multiple games, right? Is there is there a is there a central lesson you'd like to pass on? Uh before talking about great spiritual talks or before getting into such be a good human. Appreciate others. Be gentle and work on jealousy and competition, you know. Yeah, that's a big one, huh? Yeah. For ambitious people, that's a huge one. Yeah. Let people do everyone has their own thing. Let them you do your thing. Yeah. Your greatest competition, your greatest jealousy should be how you evolve. And I think love and compassion is something which we are lacking. We are very selective. Selective convenience. I know Praar so I love him more. I don't know him so I won't love him more. You're out dude. You lost. So this is what we are lacking. Right. Um is there a question you have for me since I've been asking questions all this while? H I think you should start some practices. Okay. intellectual practices that was good for you like and I think just for you specifically just disconnect sit with yourself I think that vapasa has a great impact on you but don't take it personally I think you have to be [Music] consistent so do some you will enjoy it is a very beautiful um sh karma you gaze at the candle without blinking huh and how long and I think that your subver demands that so this is a personal thing I don't know it should come out but it's a personal thing shoot at me I'm I'm so interested look I took off my glasses tell me huh there's a for you it is coming of course because kali wants only there's a very beautiful exercise which you will enjoy it and it will give you clarity of mind also is a process where we take a dya mud muda keep it one arm distance at your eye level look into it without blinking for how long then start again but do Do it. Do it. You will realize a lot of things about your own self. Do it for good 6 months. Do it for six month you will enjoy it. That part I follow. Yes. So sit cross like or sit on the chair. But spine should be straight. Spine should be straight. So this is my dya for example. One arm distance right now. You keep your mic closed. I'll keep the di here. So at eye level at eye level. Yeah. Yoga and just look into it. Bus and breathe. Breathe normally. Let the body breathe in a dark room. In a dark room. In a dark room. So it has to be done at night basically. Basically in the dark and so say I'm doing this um I'm looking at this um and then my eyes blink I just start again. Yeah it will blink but later with time you'll realize that the eyes is not blinking it is open and then later you you'll realize many things but I don't tell you because the mind has the property to create things and it is said I I get that. Yeah. So then you message me and then you will laugh. Yeah. You laugh together. And is that a 30inut thing or a 1 hour thing or should I not think of it? It's okay. Blink open. Blink open. It's okay. But 3 minutes and then I'm done. Yeah. 3 minutes to say it is difficult for sit for 2 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. I know that. I know. I know. 20 seconds then we'll see what to do. But start with this because you're not the type who's going to do rituals or mantra or not. That is not your vibe. No, your vibe is different. So then you do breath work. then then you'll enjoy. So first 6 months you said 6 months is too much. Do it for 1 month then we'll get into I'll call you in 1 month. I I'll put my notes down in 1 month. Yeah. Then breath work will come. I I massively appreciate how uh straight up you are about that too. I actually don't mind that one bit. Uh I love that. Huh? But that is what it is. No, I agree. If a person likes it, doesn't like it, it's not my burden. My job is to tell. And you've you've told me from your spontaneity which I genuinely appreciate. Thank you so I think you'll enjoy it and you will realize the subtlest emotions that you were running away from. You will encounter it. Wow. And then the breath will come. That combination of breath and tratak is where your actual meditation or dhana begins for long run. Beautiful. Beautiful man. This has been a very enjoyable conversation. Yeah. I'm very grateful because it's a very raw conversation like you are very this is who I am outside inside. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So uh very spontaneous and yeah I just go I generally will carry this artifact because I sometimes have things written on it I never open it and every time it's closed I mean I've done and I'm glad that u it is um your experience that is your getting in together. Yeah, that is good. But thrat is a game changer. Try it. I am. Of course, breath and thrat together is a dynamite. But slowly, let's start one step at a time. One step at a time. I appreciate you. Thank you so much for coming. I'm going to see you again. We're going to have more conversations in the future. Very, very grateful. time. Thank you so
