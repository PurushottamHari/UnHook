1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Every Single Book Pitch Has a Topper Like But

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
Nothing Works for Me.  I was like it won't

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,679
happen, let's leave it.  If it is not happening then

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
what is the use of reading them again and again?

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,560
I would like to thank Study IQ.  I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Got Connected to Study IQ.  Study

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
IQ supported me till Mains.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Even after that he did not leave me.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
And I have taken this mock I study IQ.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
And I would recommend Study IQ.  Yes, I

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
will definitely recommend Study

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
IQ.

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,760
Hello Friends.  Friends, for quite some time now

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,320
this controversy has been going on as to whether the US had any role in the

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,719
mediation that took place after Operation Sindoor or

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,280
not.  Donald Trump has

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,680
repeatedly said on many platforms that

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,000
this entire operation has stopped because of him.

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,320
Meaning, ceasefire was imposed here.   On the

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,719
other hand, India's stand has always been that no

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,520

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,840
third party can be involved in the entire dispute between India and Pakistan.

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,160
And even at this time no third

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,800
party has come here.

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,359
This entire ceasefire has happened only on the request of both the countries.  The

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,439
US had no role.  And in fact,

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,600
after this controversy, because

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,000
Donald Trump had said it several times, it became necessary for India to

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,240
respond.  So finally let

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
me tell you that PM Modi is currently in Canada

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,760
and this entire

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
controversy has been put to an end by him.

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,200
Because directly on the phone call

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,759
he clearly told Donald Trump that we had

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
never got mediation done with anyone before.  I have

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
n’t got it done yet and wo

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
n’t get it done in the future either.  You can see the news

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,479
India never has never will accept

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,799
mediation, PM Modi tells Trump on phone

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,560
call.  This phone call lasted for 35 minutes.  Let us

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
understand this in a little detail as to what has happened in

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,720
this.  You will get to know a lot.   In

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,880
fact, a news has also come that his

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,280
invitation has also been rejected.

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,520
PM Modi is going to Croatia instead

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
of US.  So I will tell you this also.

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
But before that friends, let me tell you all that

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
those of you who are

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,280
interested in UPSC courses.  One

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,280
thing we have done here is that we have allotted a dedicated team

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
for you.  Meaning if you have

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,000
any doubt or any problem related to batches

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,719
then you can talk on this phone number.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,320
Our team will help you.  Whatever

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,239
doubts you have will be resolved.

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,720
Ultimately what you need to do is

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,879
enter the code mentioned live at the time of check out

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,879
so that you can avail maximum discount.  Let's get

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,720
started.  First of all,

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,360
if we talk about the background, you all know

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,560
that Operation Sindoor happened between 7th May to 10th May

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
and in this a lot of exchanges took place from India and Pakistan side.

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,040

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,840
Finally you know that the

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,760
DGMO of Pakistan calls the DGMO of India

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,920
and after that this ceasefire takes place.

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,640
But in the meantime, Donald

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,040
Trump himself first tweeted about it

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,760
on social media

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,400
and said from his side that we have done a

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,400
lot of work in this entire mediation.   The

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,879
deal that is here is

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,720
done by me between India and Pakistan.  Donald Trump was

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,720
trying to take advantage of this somewhere.

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,879
And in the meanwhile, what finally happens is

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
that PM Modi has gone to Canada and look

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,440
what has happened in Canada, Donald Trump should also have been there

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
but now because of the

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,680
ongoing Israel-Iran war,

80
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
he returned yesterday only, so finally

81
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
what has happened is that PM Modi is there and other

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,000
leaders are also there.  Now what

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,480
happens in the meantime is that Donald Trump would want to go for

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Operation Sindoor and then there is a

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,720
35 minute phone call between PM Modi and Donald Trump and

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
our Foreign Secretary Vikram

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
Misri told about this during the press briefing here

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,640
and he clarified many things

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
so that the

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,799
whole world knows what exactly had happened.

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,519
So the first thing if you

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,400
see here is that PM Modi categorically

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,720
rejected Trump's claim that

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,879
America had done some kind of

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
mediation here.  Because whatever has been India's

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,480
position regarding Kashmir

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,400
towards Pakistan, it is strictly butteral.  That means

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,640
you can see the Shimla Agreement on this.  It has

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120
simply been clarified

101
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,360
that no third party will

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,760
do mediation here.  The

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
same thing was repeated in the Lahore Declaration also.  India

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,159
cannot do this thing.  So India did

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,879
not accept US and any third party

106
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,959
mediation in past, present and future.

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,599
PM Modi said this to Donald Trump here

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,760
and again said that it is the non-

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,840
negotiable principle of Indian foreign

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,680
policy.  Meaning we

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,919
cannot do any kind of negotiation in this matter.  So the

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,320
implication is that this was a

113
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,720
direct rebuttal to Trump's assertion.  An

114
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,440
attempt has been made to defuse the entire tension that Trump was repeatedly saying

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
and India has said here and ensured

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,000
that there can be no tampering with the strategic autonomy.

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
It will

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
remain completely intact.  Secondly, here

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,720
regarding the ceasefire, I mean, firstly he

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
talked about mediation and because of mediation the ceasefire

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
happened.  So again here PM Modi

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
said that this was direct military to

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,000
military communication.  Meaning, first the

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,560
DGMO of Pakistan called the DGMO of India

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
and said that we want ceasefire, to which

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
India said okay because

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,440
our main objective was the

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,840
first day of Operation Sindoor, in which we

130
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,600
attacked many terrorist bases in Pakistan, that was

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
over and we were repeatedly saying

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
that we do not want to escalate the matter.

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,280
So when Pakistan said let's do ceasefire.

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
So we also said, okay let's declare

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,360
cease fire.  So there was

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,759
no intermediary here.  Now what can happen,

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,000
see, Donald Trump was the

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,880
first person who

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,039
said this in the media that a kind of

140
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,120
mediation has been done by the US.

141
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,039
Now, what may be possible is that

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,360
Pakistan might have informed Trump.

143
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
So Trump got excited and posted it.  In

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
a way, I was also making my domestic audience

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
happy by saying, see how I am

146
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
bringing peace to the world.  So this one

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,160
could be there, somewhere.  But the

148
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,680
implication is that this happened because of India's aim and the

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,759
global narrative and not

150
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,520
because of external powers.

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,440
Somewhere or the other we have dispelled it.

152
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,919
And at the same time, we have also in a way challenged Pakistan's

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,759
repeated call for third party mediation

154
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,840

155
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,600
through this phone call.  Apart from this,

156
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,160
another important thing happened here.

157
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,639
Donald Trump was saying that we were

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,560
threatening here regarding trade that if you do not

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,039
do this ceasefire, do not do that, do

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,520
not do mediation then we will stop trading with you.

161
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,080
So in that case also, PM Modi

162
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,400
told Donald Trump during the phone call

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,639
that there was no linkage between ceasefire

164
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
diplomacy and any India-US

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,120
trade deal.  This has nothing to do with this.

166
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,880
Meaning, here a narrative was being spread

167
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,600
across the world that

168
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,680
we have

169
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
given a lot of encouragement to commercial diplomacy.  So PM Modi

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,240
said this during the phone call, look,

171
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,319
we do not do transactional diplomacy in national security matters.

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319

173
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,960
Meaning, if it is a matter of national security then there

174
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,759
can be no compromise with it.

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,440
This is simply the biggest issue for us.

176
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,840
So it is not that

177
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
this will happen only if we trade.  So, many of these

178
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,160
things have become clear.  Now apart from this,

179
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,319
if you see here,

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,199
terrorism was also discussed during the phone call.  Here

181
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,919
PM Modi strongly stated that the

182
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,240
way India has been attacked in the past

183
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,720
, be it Pulwama or the recent

184
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Pahalgam attack, India

185
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,039
no longer views terrorism as a proxy war.

186
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,039
He actually sees it as a war.

187
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,520
So what was Pakistan doing all these years

188
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,560
?  He used to attack India through proxies, that is

189
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,960
through his ISI,

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,880
through army personnel, that is by

191
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,199
sending them in civilian dress.

192
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,440
So, somewhere India also

193
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
remained on the back foot that look, the Pakistani

194
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
army did not attack.

195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,639
Pakistan has not attacked directly.

196
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,120
They are terrorists who have attacked.

197
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,440
But now India's clear

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
statement here is that look, we do

199
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,560
not see this as a proxy war.  If there is

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,039
any kind of attack from across the border, it will be

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,520
considered a war for us.  Just a war that

202
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,319
Pakistan has declared war against us.

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,560
And for that India will respond with full son force.

204
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
We will

205
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
not tolerate any form of cross border terrorism.

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
And what was Trump's response to this

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,120
?  He gave condolence

208
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,960
for the Pahalgam attack.  He said that yes, terrorism is

209
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,520
a shared threat.  There is a threat for us too,

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
and

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,160
we will continue to provide US support to India in counter terror efforts.

212
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,000
Look at the implication of this,

213
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,919
India has in a way redefined the rules of

214
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,720
engagement.

215
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,039
Meaning military response is now a

216
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,360
legitimate and immediate reaction to terror

217
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,440
attack.  If there is any terror attack, we will

218
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,440
give a military response and

219
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
you will see a big shift in India's

220
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
security doctrine.  So all these

221
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,960
things were discussed.  But

222
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
along with this, a very interesting thing has happened.  The

223
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,759
first thing is that this year the

224
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
Quad Summit is to be held in Delhi, India.  And for this,

225
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,560
PM Modi first invited Trump to

226
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,320
come to the COD Summit.  You all know it is

227
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
very important in today's date.  So

228
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
Trump accepted it and also suggested

229
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,719
that US's interest

230
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,360
in the Indo-Pacific collaboration will continue.   On the

231
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,839
other hand, here Trump wanted that

232
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
before PM Modi leaves, it is a kind of

233
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,200
short term.  Now what could be the short term

234
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,760
?  Because PM Modi is just

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,240
next to the US.  There is Canada above, so I wanted to

236
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,560

237
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,040
visit the US once when I return to India from Canada.  So somewhere it is being

238
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,040
said that PM Modi declined that visit

239
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,519
because things were already

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,080
packed very tightly.  That means there are domestic and

241
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,880
international commitments and for now

242
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,279
we have committed that the

243
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
Prime Minister of India, PM Modi will visit Croatia.

244
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,080
So, you will get to see a big snub somewhere or the other.

245
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,000

246
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
Why is PM Modi's visit to Croatia so important?

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
Look, we have prioritized this.

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,200
Croatia: First of all, understand that

249
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,360
if you look here in Europe, it is a small

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
country.  If you can see it in the middle,

251
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,640
its entire shape looks like this

252
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,480
and here is the

253
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,200
Adriatic Sea.  Ok?

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,880
You all know this entire Mediterranean Sea.  And here

255
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,279
it becomes important for us.

256
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,959
This move was not accidental.  It means that it is

257
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,440
not so easy that the President of America

258
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,760
says that it will be better if you go through our place.

259
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,440
But somewhere or the

260
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
other we rejected that thing, PM Modi

261
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,680
said that look, right now our entire

262
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
engagement is with Croatia, so

263
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,360
we cannot deny it there.  We have to go there.

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
So why Croatia?

265
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,000
Why is Croatia so important?  India

266
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,320

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,240

268
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,000
wants to expand its influence in Central and Eastern Europe.  We want to

269
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,760
bring our influence there as well.

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
If

271
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,600
you look at Croatia today, it is a part of the European Union

272
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,959
, a part of NATO and a part of the Three Seas

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
Initiative.  Well, this

274
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,160
may come in your exam.  What is the Three Seas?

275
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
Basically I told you there

276
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,279
is Adriatic Sea here.  Ok?  Above is the Baltic

277
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
Sea and here is the Black Sea.  So, there are

278
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,720

279
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,720
around 13 countries in between these, basically one or three.  And

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,519
these are the components of the entire Three C

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,519
Initiative.  So Croatia is also a part of this.

282
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,320
So here India sees a new

283
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,000
geo-economic frontier.  Meaning,

284
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
PM Modi's visit

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,480
demonstrates that India is not

286
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,560
dependent on any one country.  Even if there is a

287
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
global power like the US.  India's

288
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,920
foreign policy will be based on strategic autonomy and

289
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,440
balanced partnership.  So in a

290
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,760
way it's a symbolic snub to the US

291
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,079
by not visiting the US.  In a way

292
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,000
we have said that we are

293
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,760
not going to succumb to the pressure of any one country.  No matter

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,399
how close a partner he is to us.

295
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,399
Friendship not interference.  This is what India

296
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,399
wants; it wants to have behavioral relations with everyone

297
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
on the lines of friendship.

298
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,440
On the basis of not interference.  So overall see,

299
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,279
what is the takeaway at the end of the video

300
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
?  Whatever has happened this is it.  The

301
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,560
first is diplomatic autonomy.  Meaning, India will

302
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,800
not allow US and any power to intervene

303
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,640
in Indo-Pak matters.  We have done this clearly.

304
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,880
Then the second thing is that cross border

305
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,120
terrorism will be seen as an act of war.

306
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,600
Third is PM Modi correcting the record

307
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,360
publicly.  Because Donald Trump was continuously

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,959
raising this issue several times.  So we

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,959
said this thing publicly here and

310
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,880
made it crystal clear that the US had

311
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,560
no role in it.  It is possible that Donald Trump may

312
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,720
repeat this again and again.  There

313
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,440
is no trust in him.  But apart from this, India has

314
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,240
strictly upheld the butter framework and the

315
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,160
historical treaties

316
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
and you will see a big change in the global image here too.

317
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360

318
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,680
India has projected as a

319
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,839
confident regional power that we are

320
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,440
not under anyone's pressure.  So this was the whole video

321
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,800
friends.  I hope you have understood the details

322
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
and before leaving, a very

323
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,680
interesting question.  There

324
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,760
is an agreement between India and the US called BECA Basic

325
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,519
Exchange and Cooperation Agreement.  What

326
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,040
is this exactly?  It is related to what I want to

327
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,639
tell you.  You all know its right answer.  You

328
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,079
will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't

329
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,839
matter if you are not there.   You

330
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,000
can get its correct answer from Telegram.

331
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
