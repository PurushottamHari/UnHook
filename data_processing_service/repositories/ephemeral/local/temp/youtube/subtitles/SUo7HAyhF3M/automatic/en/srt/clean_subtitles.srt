Friends, for quite some time now this controversy has been going on as to whether the US had any role in the mediation that took place after Operation Sindoor or not.  Donald Trump has repeatedly said on many platforms that this entire operation has stopped because of him. Meaning, ceasefire was imposed here.   On the other hand, India's stand has always been that no third party can be involved in the entire dispute between India and Pakistan. And even at this time no third party has come here. This entire ceasefire has happened only on the request of both the countries.  The US had no role.  And in fact, after this controversy, because Donald Trump had said it several times, it became necessary for India to respond.  So finally let me tell you that PM Modi is currently in Canada and this entire controversy has been put to an end by him. Because directly on the phone call he clearly told Donald Trump that we had never got mediation done with anyone before.  I have n’t got it done yet and wo n’t get it done in the future either.  You can see the news India never has never will accept mediation, PM Modi tells Trump on phone call.  This phone call lasted for 35 minutes.  Let us understand this in a little detail as to what has happened in this.  You will get to know a lot.   In fact, a news has also come that his invitation has also been rejected. PM Modi is going to Croatia instead of US.  So I will tell you this also. But before that friends, let me tell you all that those of you who are interested in UPSC courses.  One thing we have done here is that we have allotted a dedicated team for you.  Meaning if you have any doubt or any problem related to batches then you can talk on this phone number. Our team will help you.  Whatever doubts you have will be resolved. Ultimately what you need to do is enter the code mentioned live at the time of check out so that you can avail maximum discount.  Let's get started.  First of all, if we talk about the background, you all know that Operation Sindoor happened between 7th May to 10th May and in this a lot of exchanges took place from India and Pakistan side. Finally you know that the DGMO of Pakistan calls the DGMO of India and after that this ceasefire takes place. But in the meantime, Donald Trump himself first tweeted about it on social media and said from his side that we have done a lot of work in this entire mediation.   The deal that is here is done by me between India and Pakistan.  Donald Trump was trying to take advantage of this somewhere. And in the meanwhile, what finally happens is that PM Modi has gone to Canada and look what has happened in Canada, Donald Trump should also have been there but now because of the ongoing Israel-Iran war, he returned yesterday only, so finally what has happened is that PM Modi is there and other leaders are also there.  Now what happens in the meantime is that Donald Trump would want to go for Operation Sindoor and then there is a 35 minute phone call between PM Modi and Donald Trump and our Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told about this during the press briefing here and he clarified many things so that the whole world knows what exactly had happened. So the first thing if you see here is that PM Modi categorically rejected Trump's claim that America had done some kind of mediation here.  Because whatever has been India's position regarding Kashmir towards Pakistan, it is strictly butteral.  That means you can see the Shimla Agreement on this.  It has simply been clarified that no third party will do mediation here.  The same thing was repeated in the Lahore Declaration also.  India cannot do this thing.  So India did not accept US and any third party mediation in past, present and future. PM Modi said this to Donald Trump here and again said that it is the non- negotiable principle of Indian foreign policy.  Meaning we cannot do any kind of negotiation in this matter.  So the implication is that this was a direct rebuttal to Trump's assertion.  An attempt has been made to defuse the entire tension that Trump was repeatedly saying and India has said here and ensured that there can be no tampering with the strategic autonomy. It will remain completely intact.  Secondly, here regarding the ceasefire, I mean, firstly he talked about mediation and because of mediation the ceasefire happened.  So again here PM Modi said that this was direct military to military communication.  Meaning, first the DGMO of Pakistan called the DGMO of India and said that we want ceasefire, to which India said okay because our main objective was the first day of Operation Sindoor, in which we attacked many terrorist bases in Pakistan, that was over and we were repeatedly saying that we do not want to escalate the matter. So when Pakistan said let's do ceasefire. So we also said, okay let's declare cease fire.  So there was no intermediary here.  Now what can happen, see, Donald Trump was the first person who said this in the media that a kind of mediation has been done by the US. Now, what may be possible is that Pakistan might have informed Trump. So Trump got excited and posted it.  In a way, I was also making my domestic audience happy by saying, see how I am bringing peace to the world.  So this one could be there, somewhere.  But the implication is that this happened because of India's aim and the global narrative and not because of external powers. Somewhere or the other we have dispelled it. And at the same time, we have also in a way challenged Pakistan's repeated call for third party mediation through this phone call.  Apart from this, another important thing happened here. Donald Trump was saying that we were threatening here regarding trade that if you do not do this ceasefire, do not do that, do not do mediation then we will stop trading with you. So in that case also, PM Modi told Donald Trump during the phone call that there was no linkage between ceasefire diplomacy and any India-US trade deal.  This has nothing to do with this. Meaning, here a narrative was being spread across the world that we have given a lot of encouragement to commercial diplomacy.  So PM Modi said this during the phone call, look, we do not do transactional diplomacy in national security matters. Meaning, if it is a matter of national security then there can be no compromise with it. This is simply the biggest issue for us. So it is not that this will happen only if we trade.  So, many of these things have become clear.  Now apart from this, if you see here, terrorism was also discussed during the phone call.  Here PM Modi strongly stated that the way India has been attacked in the past , be it Pulwama or the recent Pahalgam attack, India no longer views terrorism as a proxy war. He actually sees it as a war. So what was Pakistan doing all these years ?  He used to attack India through proxies, that is through his ISI, through army personnel, that is by sending them in civilian dress. So, somewhere India also remained on the back foot that look, the Pakistani army did not attack. Pakistan has not attacked directly. They are terrorists who have attacked. But now India's clear statement here is that look, we do not see this as a proxy war.  If there is any kind of attack from across the border, it will be considered a war for us.  Just a war that Pakistan has declared war against us. And for that India will respond with full son force. We will not tolerate any form of cross border terrorism. And what was Trump's response to this ?  He gave condolence for the Pahalgam attack.  He said that yes, terrorism is a shared threat.  There is a threat for us too, and we will continue to provide US support to India in counter terror efforts. Look at the implication of this, India has in a way redefined the rules of engagement. Meaning military response is now a legitimate and immediate reaction to terror attack.  If there is any terror attack, we will give a military response and you will see a big shift in India's security doctrine.  So all these things were discussed.  But along with this, a very interesting thing has happened.  The first thing is that this year the Quad Summit is to be held in Delhi, India.  And for this, PM Modi first invited Trump to come to the COD Summit.  You all know it is very important in today's date.  So Trump accepted it and also suggested that US's interest in the Indo-Pacific collaboration will continue.   On the other hand, here Trump wanted that before PM Modi leaves, it is a kind of short term.  Now what could be the short term ?  Because PM Modi is just next to the US.  There is Canada above, so I wanted to visit the US once when I return to India from Canada.  So somewhere it is being said that PM Modi declined that visit because things were already packed very tightly.  That means there are domestic and international commitments and for now we have committed that the Prime Minister of India, PM Modi will visit Croatia. So, you will get to see a big snub somewhere or the other. Why is PM Modi's visit to Croatia so important? Look, we have prioritized this. Croatia: First of all, understand that if you look here in Europe, it is a small country.  If you can see it in the middle, its entire shape looks like this and here is the Adriatic Sea.  Ok? You all know this entire Mediterranean Sea.  And here it becomes important for us. This move was not accidental.  It means that it is not so easy that the President of America says that it will be better if you go through our place. But somewhere or the other we rejected that thing, PM Modi said that look, right now our entire engagement is with Croatia, so we cannot deny it there.  We have to go there. So why Croatia? Why is Croatia so important?  India wants to expand its influence in Central and Eastern Europe.  We want to bring our influence there as well. If you look at Croatia today, it is a part of the European Union , a part of NATO and a part of the Three Seas Initiative.  Well, this may come in your exam.  What is the Three Seas? Basically I told you there is Adriatic Sea here.  Ok?  Above is the Baltic Sea and here is the Black Sea.  So, there are around 13 countries in between these, basically one or three.  And these are the components of the entire Three C Initiative.  So Croatia is also a part of this. So here India sees a new geo-economic frontier.  Meaning, PM Modi's visit demonstrates that India is not dependent on any one country.  Even if there is a global power like the US.  India's foreign policy will be based on strategic autonomy and balanced partnership.  So in a way it's a symbolic snub to the US by not visiting the US.  In a way we have said that we are not going to succumb to the pressure of any one country.  No matter how close a partner he is to us. Friendship not interference.  This is what India wants; it wants to have behavioral relations with everyone on the lines of friendship. On the basis of not interference.  So overall see, what is the takeaway at the end of the video ?  Whatever has happened this is it.  The first is diplomatic autonomy.  Meaning, India will not allow US and any power to intervene in Indo-Pak matters.  We have done this clearly. Then the second thing is that cross border terrorism will be seen as an act of war. Third is PM Modi correcting the record publicly.  Because Donald Trump was continuously raising this issue several times.  So we said this thing publicly here and made it crystal clear that the US had no role in it.  It is possible that Donald Trump may repeat this again and again.  There is no trust in him.  But apart from this, India has strictly upheld the butter framework and the historical treaties and you will see a big change in the global image here too. India has projected as a confident regional power that we are not under anyone's pressure.  So this was the whole video friends.  I hope you have understood the details and before leaving, a very interesting question.  There is an agreement between India and the US called BECA Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement.  What is this exactly?  It is related to what I want to tell you.  You all know its right answer.  You will find it on my Instagram.  It doesn't matter if you are not there.
