1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:12,400
This is a pencil. It's 7.7 mm

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:13,639
thick. This is the S25 Ultra. It's 8.2

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,560
mm

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:22,920
thick. And this this is the S25 Edge.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,720
It's just 5.8 mm

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,199
thick. We got to talk about these ultra

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,199
thin foams.

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,760
Okay, so the obvious take is nobody

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
asked for this. Like these ultra thin

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,600
phones look cool or whatever. They make

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,160
for a snazzy commercial, but what we

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,480
really want is thicker phones that have

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
less camera bump but way more battery.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,719
The universal thing that everyone wants

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,600
is more battery, not thinner phones.

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,120
Facts. This is true. And I I could just

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,680
end this video right here. But I

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,600
figured, what if we actually gave it a

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,480
shot? What if I actually daily drove a

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,120
phone whose biggest feature is how thin

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,360
it is? So, I did. Now, the thing that

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,159
won't shock you is that the rest of this

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,880
phone is very familiar. From the front,

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,280
it's literally a Galaxy S25 Plus. Same

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,799
size, 6.7 in display, 1440p, 120 Hz,

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,320
plenty bright, it's beautiful. It's got

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,479
this ultrasonic fingerprint reader,

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,159
still super fast. And then all of the

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,400
same software. So, it has the newly

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,720
updated 1 UI7 that I also just got on my

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,119
Ultra. and mostly like the vertically

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,600
scrolling app drawer is nice. Uh the new

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,759
extra swipes to get to quick settings is

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,920
kind of annoying, but pro tip, if you go

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,479
to notification panel settings and then

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,240
switch them from separate to together,

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,520
it no longer requires extra swipes to

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,520
get to quick settings. They're supposed

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,439
to be quick after all. But there's also,

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,960
of course, the iOS copycat stuff, too.

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,040
Maybe you've seen the obvious dynamic

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,960
island clone on other phones before.

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
Apparently, Samsung is not immune to it.

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
But there's three main things that are

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,119
actually new about using this phone,

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,000
which is the cameras, the battery, and

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
the thinness and lightness, which you'll

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,360
see what I mean. So, they've managed to

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
actually stuff the same main camera as

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,399
the S25 Ultra in this phone, which is

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,479
kind of crazy. Great camera, 200

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,640
megapixel sensor that bends down to 12

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
megapixel shots by default. It makes

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,840
these nice, sharp images in a big

55
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,080
variety of scenes. It's great. But then

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
unlike the rest of the S25 lineup, there

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,280
are no telephoto cameras on this phone.

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,040
Now, on one hand, I can argue it makes

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
logical sense, like there's less room

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,760
inside the phone here, and often a 2x

61
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,080
digital zoom from a good sensor is

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,319
actually better than a 2x optical zoom

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
from a crappy small sensor. But yeah,

64
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,120
you are definitely missing out on the

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,480
further zoom performance here, which

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
might not seem like much, but every once

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480
in a while, having some far zoom does

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,720
come in very handy. I was just at my

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,599
cousin's graduation and I think every

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,000
single human there was zoomed as far in

71
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,080
as their phone could physically go. And

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,760
so then a phone with a telephoto feels

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,480
obvious. But instead the second camera

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,000
here is an ultrawide. Not the same

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
ultrawide as the ultra phone though.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,239
This is a smaller 12 megapixel sensor. I

77
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,680
found it to still be very solid though.

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
Doesn't have any big weaknesses or

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,840
vignetting or softness issues like I

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,519
found on some of the iPhones ultrawides.

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
And it does macros as well. What you're

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,840
probably wondering more about though is

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,440
the battery. And yep, there's no way

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,599
around it. It's definitely worse. This

85
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,000
is a huge S25 plus-siz screen with a

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,760
smaller battery than the regular S25.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,720
So, yeah, you notice it. It's 3,900 mAh,

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,400
which is enough to be fine. And you can

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
end the day with a bit of battery life

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
left on a light day. And there's a whole

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,319
ton of people that live most of their

92
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,920
daily lives with very predictable

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,519
charging opportunities. Like you might

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
be like me and have a wireless charger

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
at your desk at work in front of you all

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,640
the time. You might charge during your

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,640
driving commute. Maybe you're always

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,120
around an outlet when you're at home. So

99
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,159
it's manageable. But you got to think if

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,920
it's already 25% worse than the S25 Plus

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,360
as a starting point, then you already

102
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,120
know when this phone gets old, it's

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,360
going to be even worse. I'm sure someone

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,959
will do a scientific test and and get

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,519
exact values out of this, but I think in

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,159
general, if you are expecting six hours

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,280
of screen on time out of an A+ flagship

108
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,239
phone all day, convenient, then expect

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,799
closer to 4 and a half to five out of

110
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,120
this, not as hot. But all the sacrifice,

111
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,680
of course, was made in the name of

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,600
thinness and lightness because that

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,680
pesky graphite and copper that gives you

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
incredible all day battery life is also

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
so thick and heavy. And if only you

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,720
could just get rid of some of it, then

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,680
you could have this stunningly thin

118
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,280
piece of metal. And let me tell

119
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,840
you, it is really thin and light. It's

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
kind of crazy. I'm so sorry to say, but

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,040
there are there are a couple devices

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,160
that have come out in the past couple

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
years that are genuinely impressively

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
thin and light, and they feel just kind

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,040
of like this amazingly thin sheet of

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,280
metal that happens to have a screen on

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,600
it. Like the Galaxy Tab Ultra was one of

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,840
those. Uh, the new iPad Pro was another

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
one of those from this past year. And

130
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,880
this phone is another one of those.

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Like, it's one of those things where,

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,160
okay, yeah, it looks a little thinner on

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
video. Whoop-dedoo. Snazzy commercial.

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
Great. I put it up next to another

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,400
phone. It makes it look thick. Cool. It

136
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,120
could do that. But then you hold it and

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,360
start using it, and that is the exact

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
moment that it starts being impressive.

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
Like I've showed this phone now to a

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,960
whole bunch of people in this studio and

141
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,039
out there in the real world and you know

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,880
looking at it even they'd be oh yeah you

143
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
know it looks kind of thin but then I'd

144
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
hand it to them and then then they'd be

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
super impressed when they actually hold

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
the thing. Now will that feeling go away

147
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,520
after a couple of months of using this

148
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,280
phone? Yeah, maybe a little bit. Uh will

149
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
this feel totally pointless to some

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,639
people once they put a case on the

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
phone? I think for some people yes.

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,479
Honestly, this phone with a case on it,

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
though, is still thinner than any

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,160
regular phone with a case on it. But

155
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,320
then, will this phone have durability

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,479
issues like a certain other thin phone

157
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
in the past? Well, I I feel like if

158
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,320
you're Samsung, there's no way you

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,479
didn't consider that. And so, this phone

160
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,560
has Gorilla Glass, ceramic, too, and

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,319
titanium for the frame. And so, I feel

162
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
like there's no chance they repeat the

163
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
bending in pocket mistakes of the past.

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
But only time will tell, I guess. I just

165
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,680
can't get over the fact that it's it's

166
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,880
holding the phone in person that has

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,360
sold way more people than any video or

168
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
photo comparison ever could, which I

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,960
understand probably is extremely ironic

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,280
considering I'm telling you this through

171
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,720
a video and I can't hand you the phone,

172
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
but you're just going to have to trust

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
me on this one. Also, this here is one

174
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,960
of the last phones Samsung used the Edge

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,639
name on. This is my Samsung Galaxy S6

176
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,479
Edge. And they call these older phones

177
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,720
edge because they curved the display

178
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,240
glass over the left and right edges,

179
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
giving it a kind of a bezelless

180
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,560
waterfall effect since screen to body

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,639
ratio was like a huge deal at the time.

182
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,639
And it also happened to make the rails

183
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
of the phone that you actually hold

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,400
extremely thin, which was a kind of a

185
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
unique feeling at the time. And this new

186
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,840
Edge phone, again, because of how thin

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,560
it is, is actually a unique feel in the

188
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,880
hand. And I do think it will actually

189
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,160
win some people over with the clear

190
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,400
obvious trade-off being less battery and

191
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,400
some serious table wobble with no case.

192
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Now, I can't talk about the S25 Edge

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,720
without also talking about the elephant

194
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,680
in the room, which is the rumor of

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,160
future ultra thin phones, including the

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,599
alleged iPhone 17 Air coming later this

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,520
year.

198
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,680
And my thoughts about these are really

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,240
just revolving around one thing, which

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,880
is battery. Shocker. See, earlier this

201
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
year, I reviewed the OnePlus 13. And I

202
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,560
talked about some of the big things we

203
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
expect to see in smartphones in 2025.

204
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,240
One of which is a reall life battery

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,319
advancement, which we don't see very

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
often. This one is silicon carbon

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,160
battery tech. Essentially, it allows you

208
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,560
to have higher battery density and

209
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,120
faster charging, which means you can do

210
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,440
one of two things. You can either make

211
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
phones that are the same size that have

212
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,120
much much better battery or you can

213
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,520
unlock this new ultra thin phone form

214
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,520
factor and have roughly the same battery

215
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,240
as before. The OnePlus 13 did the first

216
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,560
thing. It had a 6,000 mAh battery in the

217
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,319
size of the normal flagship and it was

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
amazing. It had 7 hour plus screen on

219
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,319
time. It was great. This S25 Edge jumps

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,800
on the ultra thin thing, but it is not a

221
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
silicon carbon battery. Uh, so there's

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
some speculation why maybe Samsung

223
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,879
couldn't source enough of this new

224
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,240
battery tech to ship the number of

225
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
phones that they were planning to with

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,400
this model. Or maybe they're just a

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
little bit apprehensive about taking

228
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,080
risks in the battery departments after

229
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
getting burned in the past. Totally

230
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
fair. Either way, they jumped on the

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
ultra thin thing, but battery life

232
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,080
suffered. So, what about the rumored

233
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,760
iPhone 17 Air? Well, word on the street

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,760
is that phone also won't use a silicon

235
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
carbon battery, possibly for a lot of

236
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
the same reasons. The rumors I'm reading

237
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,399
now are pointing towards like a 2,800

238
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,120
mAh battery, which even in iPhone land

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,959
is just so much worse than the rest of

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,839
their lineup. And that is going to be

241
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,320
fascinating to see how they present that

242
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,560
and how they justify that. Either way,

243
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,959
look, I think I think ultra thin phones

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
can work with silicon carbon battery

245
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,680
tech. I think something like this with

246
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,080
like a 4500 to 5,000 mAh battery would

247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,399
be amazing. Ultra thin phone lasts all

248
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,200
day. Great. And then they can also make

249
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,040
a regular size phone with a super long

250
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,880
battery life. And then people can pick

251
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,760
between the two. I just saw Realme made

252
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,680
a concept phone that's a totally normal

253
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,600
8 1/2 mm thick, but with a crazy 10,000

254
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,600
mAh battery and 320 watt fast charging,

255
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,279
which would be incredible. Now, yes, it

256
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
is a concept phone, so it's not real.

257
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,720
It's more of a demonstration of the

258
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,440
advancements of silicon carbon battery

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,080
tech. But that's the stuff that we're

260
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,600
hoping is on the horizon. Maybe S26 Edge

261
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,279
will get there. Thanks for watching.

262
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,279
Catch you guys in the next one.

263
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,839
Peace. Never. Ever.
