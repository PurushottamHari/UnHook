00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello Friends.  Friends, I am sure that

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,400
since yesterday you must have been continuously hearing about the Dumb Step Plane

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,400
and it is being said that this

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,280
Doomsday Plane can

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,360
stand nuclear blast and lands in

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,440
Washington.  has landed in Washington.  So, we

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,160
need to understand this in a little detail

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,160
that what is this Doms Day Plane?

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,560
For what purpose is it used in America

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,720
?  And using it now means what does it

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,640
indicate between Israel, Iran, war,

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,240
I will tell you all that in detail.

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
Let's move on.  But before that

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,079
friends, a little information, those of you who are

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,280

can avail maximum discount on the course.  Let's get started.  The

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
first question that will

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,680
come to your mind is, what is this E4B Doomsday Plane

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,039
?  Basically you must have

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,960
heard about Boeing.  The

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
Air India plane that crashed recently was

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,080
manufactured by Boeing, Boeing

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,159
747200.

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,479
But Boeing 747200 has been heavily modified.

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,320
If you look at this, we are

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,000
talking about this particular plane.

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,400
United States of America is written on it.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,320
So it has been heavily modified.

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,520
And it serves as the National Airbone

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,840
Operations Centre.  Meaning, it can work as the National Airborne Operations Center for the

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,560
US President, Secretary of Defense,

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,600
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,079

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,400
And the nickname given to

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,400
it 'Dumb Stay Plane' has been

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,280
given because it has been

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,040
designed in such a way that it can function

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,079
even in the time of nuclear war or any

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,280
catastrophic national emergency.

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,680
Meaning, if there is

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,399
any kind of attack anywhere on US soil, then

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,200
it

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,600
can save things while flying in the air and the

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,840
President of America

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,000
can give whatever command he wants by riding on it.

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,560
If we talk about its capabilities,

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,879
basically it is protected against

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
electromagnetic pulse attacks from

56
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,480
nuclear blasts.  So what I

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
told you is that even if a nuclear blast

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,280
happens, it can survive from it.

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,480
Additionally it can control US nuclear

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,440
arsenal strategic forces remotely.  Meaning,

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,920
sitting in this plane, the US President, the

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,080
Secretary of Defense, or anyone else who

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,280
wants to give commands, they can do so.

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,599
And along with this, it

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
can operate in the air for more than 24 hours.  And obviously you

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,760
can operate it for as long as you want because it has the facility of mid-air

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,239
refueling that another

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,040
plane will come and fill fuel in it

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,040
in the air itself and it can fly continuously in the air.

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,920
Then if you look inside it, there is

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,800
secure communication here.  Meaning 67

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,800
satellite antennas global radio links,

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
if there is crisis communication then

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,519
this can be done at that time.  Besides this

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
it is a mobile pentagon.  You all

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,159
know that Pentagon is the defense headquarters

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,040
of America.  So in a way, if the

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,599
Pentagon is attacked, then like the Pentagon, it will

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
operate in the air and in a way, the

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,319
continuity of governance will be maintained.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,760
Again, this plane has different

83
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
sections.  You can see the rest

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
area, communication area,

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,640
briefing room here, conference

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,280
room here.  In this the total is said to be 111 or 112.

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,840
All total passengers

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
can travel together.  And again if you see, it is

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,560
said that this E4B one was made in 1980.

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
Well, let

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
me tell you the most interesting thing in this that

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,080
whenever Donald Trump, that is the

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,319
President of America, goes abroad, travels outside America,

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,440
then what happens in most of the cases is that

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,680
this E4B, which is being called the Doomsday Plane, is

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,000
also made to land at the same

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
particular airport, that is, at some airport near where the

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,120
Air Force One of the President of America lands, so that

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,799

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
suppose the

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,879
President of America has gone on a world tour, then

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
in that case, if suddenly there is an

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,920
emergency or a world crisis, then

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,920
he should be shifted from Air Force One to this particular

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,080
plane

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,159
on an immediate basis.  So things like this are also done many times.

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
Well now the question here is

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,400
that what is this plane doing in Washington

109
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,160
and why is there a discussion about it

110
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
?  Look what has happened to this

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
plane. It is being said that it

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
recently took a non-routine path.  From where to

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,560
where?  Again we will understand a little bit in the map.

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
If you look at this map of America, there are

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
many states here.  There are total 50

116
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
states.  you all know.  So you must be

117
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,000
seeing that this is a

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,160
small state next to Texas.  Louisiana is not only small but also big.  There

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,880

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,600
is an air force base here in Louisiana called Barks Dale Air Force

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,320
Base.  From there the plane takes off and

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,479
goes to Maryland.  Maryland is basically

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,400

124
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,560
adjacent to Washington DC, if I tell you.  Again, you will understand it better from this map.

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Here is the state of Maryland.

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
Here's Virginia, and here's the middle.  I

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,759
mean, what is Washington DC? It is a

128
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,520
federal governed district.  Federal Government

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,600
District, just as an example, if

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,320
I talk about India, you must have

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
heard about Delhi, then there is NCT of Delhi

132
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,120
in which you get to see the governance of the Central Government as well as the

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,880

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,199
governance of the local government.  So that's the

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,199
type of structure you'll

136
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,120
see with Washington DC.  Maryland and

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,880
Virginia are different states.  So

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,039
in the middle of it you can see that the

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,120
Potomac River also flows from here.

140
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,039
So this is Washington DC.  So this plane landed at

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,840

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,320
Joint Based Andrews in Maryland, just next to Washington DC.

143
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,840
And the

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,759
interesting thing about this is that the

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,479
flight watchers here say that again

146
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,800
you will see this, here is Louisiana.  It

147
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,960
takes off from here.  And if you look carefully,

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,919
if one had to fly normally, one

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,919
could have travelled from here to Maryland.

150
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
But if you see the route it has taken, it has

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,240
taken the coastal route here.  That

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,400
means

153
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,560
it is going along the coast.  And because of this, these

154
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,000
observers say that it is

155
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,600
interpreted as a show of readiness.  Meaning,

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,479
no training of any kind is taking place at

157
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,280
this time.  This flight is ready

158
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,000
for any situation, in a way.  And if you

159
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,759
see, its call sign means whenever

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,319
this plane flies, it has a call sign.

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,199
So here the typical order is of six in

162
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,280
which it is on low alert.

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,160
But now when it took off and

164
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,759
went near Washington, its call sign was

165
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,240
Order 01, which meant it was on its highest alert.

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,880
So I hope you can understand that

167
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,720
because of this, its route was different and suddenly

168
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,560
it was launched at this time.  So because of this, people

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,960
started discussing it.  The question is why now there is

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,120
conflict between Israel and Iran, you

171
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,440
all know that at present there is a major development in the

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,919
world and the only discussion going on in the world is that

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,680
what will happen next, so as

174
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,360
you all know Israel attacked Iran's

175
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
nuclear and military infrastructure here

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,360
and Iran also

177
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,000
retaliated, did massive retaliation with

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
missiles and drones and many of Israel's

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,479
infrastructures have also been

180
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,720
destroyed here.  In fact, Israel and Iran

181
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,800

182
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,280
even launched Fateh One hypersonic missile here and you can see here

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,039
that the medical center, the stock market, the

184
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,199
Israel stock market building have

185
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,599
also been attacked.  Iranian leader has

186
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,759
also said that the battle has begun, meaning this

187
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
full scale war is going on right now.  In

188
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,039
view of this, what is the US response?

189
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,680
Donald Trump has given a warning here that

190
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,960
now you will have to surrender unconditionally.

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,520
Otherwise the consequences of the US will be

192
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,840
very heavy on you.  In fact, the US has

193
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,840

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,800
deployed its aircraft carrier and F35 jets in the Middle East.

195
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,520
Here, Centcom is basically the

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,919

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
central command of the US Department of Defense, so the Centcom forces have also been

198
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,080
put on high alert.  And the

199
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,160
military coordination between Israel and the Gulf

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,720
Alliance has started here.

201
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
Now the question is,

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,280
what does the deployment of E4B indicate?

203
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,080
What does this signal?  The first thing is

204
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,560
continuity of government.  Meaning, it assures

205
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,879
that the US officials,

206
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,360
in any situation, suppose there is

207
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
any kind of strategic

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
crisis in the US or anywhere else, or a nuclear crisis, then

209
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,759
here in DC, suppose in

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,919
this case Washington DC is attacked, or

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,000
anything happens, then in that case also there will be

212
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,680
governmental continuity here, there will not be any kind

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
of problem, so this is the first

214
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,479
implication and the second one here is that the US

215
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,879
is not ruling out military intervention,

216
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,800
meaning, at this time the situation can go to any extent, any

217
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,039
kind of

218
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
military intervention can be done here.

219
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,440
What happens along with this is that you

220
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,360
also play with psychology.  Showing this to the world

221
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
means that Iran must also be seeing that

222
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039
this kind of activity is taking place.  So

223
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
here this will deter Iran from

224
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,360
taking any extreme steps.  Then

225
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,880
what nuclear force communication basically is is that

226
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,160
suppose in an extreme situation, suppose land

227
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,560
based sites are attacked, then the

228
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,120
President of America here will be able to

229
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,000
board this plane and easily

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,839
give the nuclear command.  So all these signals are being

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
given here.  So the question now is

232
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
that when it was flying, that is, this

233
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,240
doomed plane that traveled, was

234
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
Donald Trump on board?  Look, there

235
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,839
is no confirmation about this yet.  The officials have

236
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,760
not yet issued any statement

237
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,680
confirming who were the passengers and

238
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,600
who were not, or whether it was going empty?   I do

239
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,839
n't know what it was.  But recently if you

240
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,160
see Trump's comments, I may do it.  I may

241
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,160
not do it.  Nobody knows what I'm

242
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,839
going to do.  Basically he was talking about attack on Iran.

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,680
So right now I don't know,

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,279
anything can happen to anyone from here.   In

245
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,120
fact, let me tell you some historical

246
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,519
facts about when this plane was

247
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,839
used.  91

248
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,839
It was launched even when the attack took place so that

249
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
command continuity could be maintained.

250
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
Because you understand the World Trade Center was

251
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,760
demolished.  Two buildings were demolished.  So

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
anything could have happened here at any time.  Such an

253
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,839
atmosphere of fear had been created.  Then this particular

254
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
plane was launched.  Even during the Cold War era

255
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,519
when there were constant issues with the Soviet Union.

256
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,760
Here, whenever there was a

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,680
nuclear alert, it was said that

258
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Russia could fire a nuclear missile.  something

259
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
happens.  Meaning, even then it was launched many times.

260
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,240
And even during the Trump era, which was

261
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,320
Donald Trump's first term,

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,120
if you look at the tensions with North Korea

263
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,440
in 2017-19, it was activated frequently at that time too.

264
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,680

265
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,080
So this is not the first time you will see this.

266
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
But what could be its geopolitical implications

267
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,720
?  Look, from here the

268
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,800
possibilities are that US-Iran conflict may

269
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,880
increase.  Right now the statement that has come is

270
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
that within the next two weeks

271
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Trump will decide what to do regarding Iran, whether to

272
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,279
retaliate or not.  So,

273
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,079
confession can increase.  Second proxy war is

274
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,600
Hezbollah, Shia people can also join this war.

275
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,200
He hasn't joined yet.

276
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,560
Well, let me tell you.

277
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
Apart from this, the nuclear

278
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,120
brickmanship here is unlikely, but

279
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,279
suppose Israel feels that it faces an

280
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
existential crisis, then

281
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,200
keep in mind that Israel also has a nuclear bomb,

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,200
so will it activate the nuclear bomb here,

283
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
what will happen, there are a lot of

284
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,760
ifs and but the conclusion is

285
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,079
that the E4B Doomsday Plane that has landed

286
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,040
near Washington DC, it is not

287
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,200
routine, it is a calculated strategic move, in

288
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,519
a way an attempt has been made by the US to give a signal

289
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,000
that we are ready,

290
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,800
our military is ready, and the command will

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,279
remain continuous here.  Adversaries like these are

292
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,120
an attempt to stop Iran and to rearm

293
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,959
Israel because according to the

294
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,640
news that was coming, just recently a report also came in which it was being

295
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,959
said that the

296
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,200
Arrow 3 missile defense system that Israel has has only

297
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,519
10 to 12 days left.  So in a

298
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,160
way maybe they too might be being rearranged to say don't

299
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,240
worry, we are there.  Ok?  So the

300
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,480
tension that is currently rising in the Middle East

301
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,959

302
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,360
can convert into a much broader regional war.  And you US

303
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,040
may be preparing for the worst case scenario.

304
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,640
So let's see

305
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,560
what happens from here.  But I hope you

306
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640

307
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
got all the information you needed about the Doomsday Plane and

308
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,959
before leaving I have a very interesting question whether

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,959
you can tell me which country has

310
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,680
provided technological

311
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,920
support to Iran's missile program.

312
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,440
Iran's missile program in the past, today we are talking about

313
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,519
nuclear missiles,

314
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,640
not that Iran is doing nuclear development, so

315
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,399
which country supported

316
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,079
Iran in its missile program,

317
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,600
you have to tell this and

318
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,200
you all know that the right answer to this will be available on my Instagram,

319
