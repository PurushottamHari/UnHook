Hello Friends.  Friends, I am sure that since yesterday you must have been continuously hearing about the Dumb Step Plane and it is being said that this Doomsday Plane can stand nuclear blast and lands in Washington.  has landed in Washington.  So, we need to understand this in a little detail that what is this Doms Day Plane? For what purpose is it used in America ?  And using it now means what does it indicate between Israel, Iran, war, I will tell you all that in detail. Let's move on.  But before that friends, a little information, those of you who are preparing for UPSC whether it is 2026 or 2027, must avail our Pratigya batch. If you have any doubt regarding this or require any information, you can call on this phone number. You will get all the details. All you have to do is use this code ANIKT LIVE so that you can avail maximum discount on the course.  Let's get started.  The first question that will come to your mind is, what is this E4B Doomsday Plane ?  Basically you must have heard about Boeing.  The Air India plane that crashed recently was manufactured by Boeing, Boeing 747200. But Boeing 747200 has been heavily modified. If you look at this, we are talking about this particular plane. United States of America is written on it. So it has been heavily modified. And it serves as the National Airbone Operations Centre.  Meaning, it can work as the National Airborne Operations Center for the US President, Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And the nickname given to it 'Dumb Stay Plane' has been given because it has been designed in such a way that it can function even in the time of nuclear war or any catastrophic national emergency. Meaning, if there is any kind of attack anywhere on US soil, then it can save things while flying in the air and the President of America can give whatever command he wants by riding on it. If we talk about its capabilities, basically it is protected against electromagnetic pulse attacks from nuclear blasts.  So what I told you is that even if a nuclear blast happens, it can survive from it. Additionally it can control US nuclear arsenal strategic forces remotely.  Meaning, sitting in this plane, the US President, the Secretary of Defense, or anyone else who wants to give commands, they can do so. And along with this, it can operate in the air for more than 24 hours.  And obviously you can operate it for as long as you want because it has the facility of mid-air refueling that another plane will come and fill fuel in it in the air itself and it can fly continuously in the air. Then if you look inside it, there is secure communication here.  Meaning 67 satellite antennas global radio links, if there is crisis communication then this can be done at that time.  Besides this it is a mobile pentagon.  You all know that Pentagon is the defense headquarters of America.  So in a way, if the Pentagon is attacked, then like the Pentagon, it will operate in the air and in a way, the continuity of governance will be maintained. Again, this plane has different sections.  You can see the rest area, communication area, briefing room here, conference room here.  In this the total is said to be 111 or 112. All total passengers can travel together.  And again if you see, it is said that this E4B one was made in 1980. Well, let me tell you the most interesting thing in this that whenever Donald Trump, that is the President of America, goes abroad, travels outside America, then what happens in most of the cases is that this E4B, which is being called the Doomsday Plane, is also made to land at the same particular airport, that is, at some airport near where the Air Force One of the President of America lands, so that suppose the President of America has gone on a world tour, then in that case, if suddenly there is an emergency or a world crisis, then he should be shifted from Air Force One to this particular plane on an immediate basis.  So things like this are also done many times. Well now the question here is that what is this plane doing in Washington and why is there a discussion about it ?  Look what has happened to this plane. It is being said that it recently took a non-routine path.  From where to where?  Again we will understand a little bit in the map. If you look at this map of America, there are many states here.  There are total 50 states.  you all know.  So you must be seeing that this is a small state next to Texas.  Louisiana is not only small but also big.  There is an air force base here in Louisiana called Barks Dale Air Force Base.  From there the plane takes off and goes to Maryland.  Maryland is basically adjacent to Washington DC, if I tell you.  Again, you will understand it better from this map. Here is the state of Maryland. Here's Virginia, and here's the middle.  I mean, what is Washington DC? It is a federal governed district.  Federal Government District, just as an example, if I talk about India, you must have heard about Delhi, then there is NCT of Delhi in which you get to see the governance of the Central Government as well as the governance of the local government.  So that's the type of structure you'll see with Washington DC.  Maryland and Virginia are different states.  So in the middle of it you can see that the Potomac River also flows from here. So this is Washington DC.  So this plane landed at Joint Based Andrews in Maryland, just next to Washington DC. And the interesting thing about this is that the flight watchers here say that again you will see this, here is Louisiana.  It takes off from here.  And if you look carefully, if one had to fly normally, one could have travelled from here to Maryland. But if you see the route it has taken, it has taken the coastal route here.  That means it is going along the coast.  And because of this, these observers say that it is interpreted as a show of readiness.  Meaning, no training of any kind is taking place at this time.  This flight is ready for any situation, in a way.  And if you see, its call sign means whenever this plane flies, it has a call sign. So here the typical order is of six in which it is on low alert. But now when it took off and went near Washington, its call sign was Order 01, which meant it was on its highest alert. So I hope you can understand that because of this, its route was different and suddenly it was launched at this time.  So because of this, people started discussing it.  The question is why now there is conflict between Israel and Iran, you all know that at present there is a major development in the world and the only discussion going on in the world is that what will happen next, so as you all know Israel attacked Iran's nuclear and military infrastructure here and Iran also retaliated, did massive retaliation with missiles and drones and many of Israel's infrastructures have also been destroyed here.  In fact, Israel and Iran even launched Fateh One hypersonic missile here and you can see here that the medical center, the stock market, the Israel stock market building have also been attacked.  Iranian leader has also said that the battle has begun, meaning this full scale war is going on right now.  In view of this, what is the US response? Donald Trump has given a warning here that now you will have to surrender unconditionally. Otherwise the consequences of the US will be very heavy on you.  In fact, the US has deployed its aircraft carrier and F35 jets in the Middle East. Here, Centcom is basically the central command of the US Department of Defense, so the Centcom forces have also been put on high alert.  And the military coordination between Israel and the Gulf Alliance has started here. Now the question is, what does the deployment of E4B indicate? What does this signal?  The first thing is continuity of government.  Meaning, it assures that the US officials, in any situation, suppose there is any kind of strategic crisis in the US or anywhere else, or a nuclear crisis, then here in DC, suppose in this case Washington DC is attacked, or anything happens, then in that case also there will be governmental continuity here, there will not be any kind of problem, so this is the first implication and the second one here is that the US is not ruling out military intervention, meaning, at this time the situation can go to any extent, any kind of military intervention can be done here. What happens along with this is that you also play with psychology.  Showing this to the world means that Iran must also be seeing that this kind of activity is taking place.  So here this will deter Iran from taking any extreme steps.  Then what nuclear force communication basically is is that suppose in an extreme situation, suppose land based sites are attacked, then the President of America here will be able to board this plane and easily give the nuclear command.  So all these signals are being given here.  So the question now is that when it was flying, that is, this doomed plane that traveled, was Donald Trump on board?  Look, there is no confirmation about this yet.  The officials have not yet issued any statement confirming who were the passengers and who were not, or whether it was going empty?   I do n't know what it was.  But recently if you see Trump's comments, I may do it.  I may not do it.  Nobody knows what I'm going to do.  Basically he was talking about attack on Iran. So right now I don't know, anything can happen to anyone from here.   In fact, let me tell you some historical facts about when this plane was used.  91 It was launched even when the attack took place so that command continuity could be maintained. Because you understand the World Trade Center was demolished.  Two buildings were demolished.  So anything could have happened here at any time.  Such an atmosphere of fear had been created.  Then this particular plane was launched.  Even during the Cold War era when there were constant issues with the Soviet Union. Here, whenever there was a nuclear alert, it was said that Russia could fire a nuclear missile.  something happens.  Meaning, even then it was launched many times. And even during the Trump era, which was Donald Trump's first term, if you look at the tensions with North Korea in 2017-19, it was activated frequently at that time too. So this is not the first time you will see this. But what could be its geopolitical implications ?  Look, from here the possibilities are that US-Iran conflict may increase.  Right now the statement that has come is that within the next two weeks Trump will decide what to do regarding Iran, whether to retaliate or not.  So, confession can increase.  Second proxy war is Hezbollah, Shia people can also join this war. He hasn't joined yet. Well, let me tell you. Apart from this, the nuclear brickmanship here is unlikely, but suppose Israel feels that it faces an existential crisis, then keep in mind that Israel also has a nuclear bomb, so will it activate the nuclear bomb here, what will happen, there are a lot of ifs and but the conclusion is that the E4B Doomsday Plane that has landed near Washington DC, it is not routine, it is a calculated strategic move, in a way an attempt has been made by the US to give a signal that we are ready, our military is ready, and the command will remain continuous here.  Adversaries like these are an attempt to stop Iran and to rearm Israel because according to the news that was coming, just recently a report also came in which it was being said that the Arrow 3 missile defense system that Israel has has only 10 to 12 days left.  So in a way maybe they too might be being rearranged to say don't worry, we are there.  Ok?  So the tension that is currently rising in the Middle East can convert into a much broader regional war.  And you US may be preparing for the worst case scenario. So let's see what happens from here.  But I hope you got all the information you needed about the Doomsday Plane and before leaving I have a very interesting question whether you can tell me which country has provided technological support to Iran's missile program. Iran's missile program in the past, today we are talking about nuclear missiles, not that Iran is doing nuclear development, so which country supported Iran in its missile program, you have to tell this and you all know that the right answer to this will be available on my Instagram, if you are not there, no problem, you can get its correct answer from Telegram and friends, as I told you, if you are preparing for UPSC, definitely avail the Pratigya batch, see it in all three languages, Hindi, English and English, so here you have to use the code Ankit live so that you can get maximum discount and there are a lot of features in it.
