00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,519
Prashant Dhawan. Israel has launched a massive attack on

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,000
Iran's nuclear facilities,

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,960
its capitals and various

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
locations. Benjamin Nitin Yahoo

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,480
himself told the world this morning that

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,039
Israel has launched a preemptive attack

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
on Iran because according to Israel, Iran was

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,760
very close to nuclear weapons

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,079
and now it was very important to do this to stop Iran.  Given the

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,640
intensity

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,120
of this attack, it is being indicated that Iran will

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
declare a full-scale war very soon

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,879
and I

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,879
want to show you the visuals here.  First we

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,280
look at how Benjamin Ethan Yahoo

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,520
told the world about Operation

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,399
Rising Lion.  Yes, the way India has

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,960
launched Operation Sindoor.  The name of Israel's

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,440
operation is Operation Rising Lion.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
Although I would say that Israel's operation is

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,239
quite different.  I will tell you why it is different.  But

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,079
first watch this short clip.  This is

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,280
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Etan

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,640
Yau.  Moments go israel lch operation

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,760
rising line.  Targeted Military Operation

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,720
to Roll Back the Uranian Threat to Israel's

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,520
Very Survival.  This operation will continue

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,920
for as many days as it takes to remove this

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,640
threat.  This is a very big statement

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,240
in itself.  It was a question of Israel's existence.  If

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Iran had acquired nuclear weapons,

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
Israel's existence would have been in danger.  And

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,520
this operation, Rising Lion, will

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,520
last for several days.  How many days?  It will last for as long as it takes.

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,520
All their nuclear

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,079
sides, their nuclear scientists.

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,880
Basically, Israel will launch so many strikes on Iran

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,680
that Iran will never be

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,159
able to complete its nuclear program.  The initiative taken

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,119
by Israel in its Rising Lion operation is

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,320
shocking.

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,040
He killed Hossan Salami in the very first attack.  He was an

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,759
Iranian officer who was the Commander in Chief of

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,079
their Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  This is the

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,320
most important force of Iran.

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,000
Their Commander in Chief was killed in the very first attack.

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,840
Apart from that, their nuclear scientists were also

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
killed.  It is being said that the

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Chief of Staff of the Armed

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,520
Forces of Iran has also been killed.  It is something like this that

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,239
suppose on the very first day of Operation Sindoor

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,239
we had killed Asim Munir,

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,800
one Brahmos at the place where Asim Munir lived,

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,959
then another Brahmos at the place where DGISPR and the

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
centre of gravity Aurangzeb etc were

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,120
sitting, at some other locations, I

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,920
mean if you want to understand

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,319
how intense is this attack by Israel on Iran.

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,200
To some extent, such comparison will have to be done

61
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,519
and even then the comparison falls short.

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,599
One theory says that India had accidentally

63
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,519

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,720
attacked some of Pakistan's nuclear side as well.  Israel has

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,280
intentionally attacked

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,680
directly the place where Iran was testing its nuclear weapons.

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
You will be able to see it here

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,360
on the map.  This is the city you see in Iran

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,920
, let me zoom in a little for you.

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,000
It is the capital of Iran.  Here in Tehran,

71
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,400
there has been an attack.  Who

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,480
was the commander of his Revolutionary Guard Corps.  His

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,599
Chief of Armed Forces was.  Both of them

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,920
died here.  There is a very important location in the south below Tehran

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,319
named Natans.

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,319
You will be able to see this here.  These are Iran's

77
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,480
uranium enrichment sites.

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,360
These people keep their sand refugees here.  This side is being

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,840
told.  Israel has been

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
hit multiple times.  The actual damage

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,640
at ground level will be known after some time.

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,360
Apart from all this, Iran's

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,000
missile stores have been attacked at many places.

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,799
Iran's air defence systems in many places

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,319
were primarily S300, yes, just like

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,280
India has S400.  The S300 used by

87
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,080
Iran is a predecessor to the S400.

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,480
Compared to S400, the range of S300 missile defense

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,959
system is quite weak, 100 to 150 km.  It

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,280
is around.  And at the same time,

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,440
it cannot stop the high-end missiles and advanced missiles.

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
And it is being said that Israel

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,599
also destroyed Iran's missile defense at many places.

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
And this video of Iran became

95
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,519
very viral on this particular social media.

96
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,920
Here you will see an amazing

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,920
video.

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
Now here you might say but what is

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
happening?  There are so

100
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,919
many explosions constantly and there are no missiles

101
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,479
falling from above.  What is this happening?  Look,

102
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,639
no missile fell here from above.  It is being told

103
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,199
that there are many agents of Mossad

104
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,080

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,720
on the ground level in Iran and as soon as the Israeli

106
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,280
air force attacked from above, they carried out an air to

107
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
ground attack and simultaneously, the

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,759
Mossad agents on the ground in Iran got

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,919
activated and they caused explosions at many of their

110
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,240
ballistic missile sites in Iran

111
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,560
where they store these missiles

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
and

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,720
you can see the result of that here, constant

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,040
explosions one after the other, the sound that is being heard,

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,759
these Iranian missiles are getting destroyed

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,080
in an underground facility, and

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,840
after carrying out such a big attack.  I mean this

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,639
is war.  You should not take it for granted that

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,560
like last time, Iran has attacked

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,880
Israel.  Israel attacked Iran.

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,000
Then both of them cooled down and sat down.  No.

122
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,919
This is a proper declaration of war.  Now the matter will

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
not stop here.  Iran and its

124
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,320
proxies will do everything

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,960
to damage Israel.  And Israel has

126
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,280
asked a question to the whole world.  In a video

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,560
by the Israeli Defense Forces.  These people

128
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,680
uploaded a 25-second video and

129
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,400
told the world that history is watching you.

130
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,320
Now the whole world will have to decide.

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,039
All the important countries are included in it.  Be it

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,320
China, India, US, Japan, pretty

133
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,880
much everyone.  European Union, everyone,

134
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,280
who will you stand with in times like this?

135
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,810
Check out this 25 second clip.  History

136
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
is watching.

141
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
Let's

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,600
decide before it's too late.  This is Israel's

143
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,400
message to the entire world and the US has

144
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,520
decided for now that brother, we do

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,600
not want to get involved in all this.  Now here, of course,

146
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
some people will ask me this that

147
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,400
during the time of Operation Sindoor, I had

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,199
told you in a video that it was the

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,840
interest of the US that Operation Sindoor should stop.

150
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,680
India should not destroy all the airbuses of Pakistan

151
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,919
badly.

152
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,639
Because tomorrow it is possible that the US

153
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,240
Air Force may use these airbases against

154
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,240
Iran.  You all might remember that I

155
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,400
told you this in the video.  This is

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,639
my video which is four weeks old.  Nuclear war

157
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,639
between India and Pakistan stopped by

158
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
Trump.  I had initially made this based on Trump's claim.

159
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,560
And please listen to this part.

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,560
Now USA's fear was that

161
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,039
India was destroying the runways of

162
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,919
Pakistan's Airbuses.  And the US

163
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,639
military has made an eventual plan for

164
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,319
war with Iran.  I am

165
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199
not saying that this war is about to start now.  On the contrary,

166
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,840
recently Trump had also scolded Nathan Yau for

167
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,520
repeatedly wanting to wage war with Iran

168
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,120
and for causing many

169
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,680
setbacks to Israel.  But the US

170
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,160
military has also made a plan somewhere about

171
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,800

172
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
what they will do if there is a war with Iran tomorrow.  In that plan, the US

173
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,199
military is sure that they will be using Pakistan's

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,360
airbuses.  Pakistan

175
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,280
's air strips etc.

176
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,759
came in handy for the USA in some way or the other.  Now this is what

177
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,000
I said four-five weeks ago.

178
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,840
Nowadays you will see this thing being mentioned in many news articles.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
For example

180
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,560
here you can see Pakistan's position

181
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,599
during a US back and Israeli bat

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
strike on Iran's wood matter immally.  The US may be

183
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,440
seeking to ensure that Pakistan

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
offers covered help such as use of its

185
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,319
military bases and assets during a

186
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,319
wider regional conflation that could involve

187
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
Iranian proxies in the Middle East.  So you

188
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,919
guys can understand.  See, USA

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,639
was very worried about Pakistan's air bases.

190
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,479
Now this matter is being discussed openly.

191
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,319
USA's defense analysts are also saying

192
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,720
that the way India was

193
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,080
destroying Pakistan

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,400
's airbases one by one, suddenly

195
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,879
alarm bells started ringing in Washington DC that

196
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,199
a big war is pending with us.

197
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,960
What will we do in that?  Asim Munir will

198
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,879
get an excuse to escape, what should I do?  India

199
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
destroyed our air bases.

200
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,400
How will I be able to help you guys now

201
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,960
?  So see, the US will

202
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,599
put pressure on Pakistan.  If Pakistan does

203
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,399
not come immediately in support of USA, then

204
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,039

205
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,959
talks are going on to call Asim Munir.  They will cancel the parades etc in the US and

206
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
say that this is fake

207
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,959
news.  Nothing, we

208
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,120
never invited Asim Munir.  And apart from that

209
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,360
maybe again see US Works in

210
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,440
Mysterious Ways.  Even the loans of Pakistan that

211
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,519
were approved by IMF, World Bank,

212
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
Asian Development Bank will have

213
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
silent riders put on them that how can this money be

214
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
spent?  Look, let me

215
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,320
tell you clearly.  Recently, people

216
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,560
in India got quite worried after seeing that

217
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,720
billions of dollars of the World Bank are

218
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,880
going to Pakistan and so many billions will

219
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,200
go.  Let me tell you clearly,

220
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,279
in this world no one helps anyone for free.

221
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,760
There is no free lunch.  If

222
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,160
loans worth billions of dollars are suddenly being

223
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,560
given to Pakistan.  During Operation Sindoor, the

224
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,959
US was so much involved, you know, these people themselves

225
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,120
claim that they were trying not to

226
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,440

227
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,200
damage Pakistan any further.  That's it now.  There is

228
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,440
only and only US self

229
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,320
interest behind it.  Obviously Donald Trump

230
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,240
wanted that Israel should not carry out this attack.

231
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,320
I met Marco Robbio, who is the

232
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
current Foreign Minister of USA.

233
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Look at his statement.  He said that

234
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,880
tonight Israel has taken unilateral action against

235
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,680
Iran.  We are not involved in this strike.

236
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,240
So here the first thing is that the

237
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,640
US is saying this to Iran.  Look, whatever

238
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,440
attack has been carried out has been done by Israel.  We

239
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,440
didn't.  Don’t target us.  Do not target those who are our

240
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,560
base in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia

241
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,880
, UAE, Qatar.

242
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,279
And let me also tell you that if this

243
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,760
conflict happens on a large scale, which it seems will definitely happen.  Do

244
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,880
n't be surprised that

245
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,920
Indians have purchased houses worth crores in UAE or you know here in

246
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,399
Gulf.

247
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,720
They have Golden Card and Golden Visa.

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,120
Ran away and came back to India for safety.

249
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,120
Because when Iran decides that now it is okay,

250
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,079
then it is a matter of do or die.  Now it is

251
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,720
simple that either we will fight or

252
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,519
you know everything will happen and in that case

253
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,519
it will impact the entire region.  Now

254
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,279
what impact will this have on India,

255
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
I will have to tell you in a separate video.  But for now

256
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,839
we have discussed that

257
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,720
Israel has launched a major attack on Iran.   We will have to

258
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,040
see what Iran's response is

259
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,920
and on that basis we will tell you

260
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,640
whether

261
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,640
a big war is going to start in this part of the world

262
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,560
or not. If some updates come then obviously

263
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,880
I will keep bringing updated videos for you.

264
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,519
Sometime you go to any website

265
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,000
where companies post jobs

266
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,480
and you will notice there that the demand for data analysts is

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,200
constantly increasing.  Whether

268
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,760
you are in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata

269
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
or anywhere.  Salaries obviously

270
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,640
range based on your experience.  But you

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,399

272
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
can easily earn even Rs 50,600 per month from 2025.  Depending on your

273
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,240
experience, depending on your skills.  And the

274
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,920
impact of data analysts is being

275
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,399
seen in every industry.  It will obviously be seen in the corporate world.

276
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,640
Apart from that,

277
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,640
articles are being published in medical science and even cricket.

278
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,800
This is a four day old

279
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,120
article about how data

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,360
analytics has transformed cricket all together.  Let

281
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,000
me tell you the reason.  Let

282
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,399
me show you for the first time

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,519

284
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,160
how someone can present data if they have the skills of a data analyst.

285
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,040
Once you have the

286
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,079
skills of a data analyst, you can create all of these things.

287
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,200
You will be able to see in what beautiful way

288
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,440
you can see the profit of a company and

289
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
how much revenue a company earned in which month.

290
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
What is the market share?  This can be made in detail.

291
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,760
Again it's not just like you

292
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,240
just choose a color scheme and

293
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,880
enter the data.  The formulas, the way

294
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,120
you enter the data, the way

295
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,160
you present the data, everything matters

296
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,880
and today companies are ready to pay people

297
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,120
who present the data to them

298
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,519
in this form

299
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,680
so that the companies can decide

300
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,160
what to do in the future.

301
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,040
Where do they want to go in the future?

302
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,279
With the help of Data Analysis course of Career 247,

303
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,360
many of our students have already become capable of creating such projects.

304
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,360

305
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
I am showing you this project of one of our students.

306
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,959
And this again is

307
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,959
just 5 to 6% of the total scale.  Apart from that, there are many

308
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,519
other tools in Data Analytics

309
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,680
in which if you become proficient, then suddenly

310
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,240
your value will increase a lot in the job market.

311
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,320
What do you simply have to do?

312
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
