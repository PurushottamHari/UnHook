Hello, welcome to Career 247, I am Prashant Dhawan. Israel has launched a massive attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, its capitals and various locations. Benjamin Nitin Yahoo himself told the world this morning that Israel has launched a preemptive attack on Iran because according to Israel, Iran was very close to nuclear weapons and now it was very important to do this to stop Iran.  Given the intensity of this attack, it is being indicated that Iran will declare a full-scale war very soon and I want to show you the visuals here.  First we look at how Benjamin Ethan Yahoo told the world about Operation Rising Lion.  Yes, the way India has launched Operation Sindoor.  The name of Israel's operation is Operation Rising Lion. Although I would say that Israel's operation is quite different.  I will tell you why it is different.  But first watch this short clip.  This is Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Etan Yau.  Moments go israel lch operation rising line.  Targeted Military Operation to Roll Back the Uranian Threat to Israel's Very Survival.  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.  This is a very big statement in itself.  It was a question of Israel's existence.  If Iran had acquired nuclear weapons, Israel's existence would have been in danger.  And this operation, Rising Lion, will last for several days.  How many days?  It will last for as long as it takes. All their nuclear sides, their nuclear scientists. Basically, Israel will launch so many strikes on Iran that Iran will never be able to complete its nuclear program.  The initiative taken by Israel in its Rising Lion operation is shocking. He killed Hossan Salami in the very first attack.  He was an Iranian officer who was the Commander in Chief of their Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  This is the most important force of Iran. Their Commander in Chief was killed in the very first attack. Apart from that, their nuclear scientists were also killed.  It is being said that the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Iran has also been killed.  It is something like this that suppose on the very first day of Operation Sindoor we had killed Asim Munir, one Brahmos at the place where Asim Munir lived, then another Brahmos at the place where DGISPR and the centre of gravity Aurangzeb etc were sitting, at some other locations, I mean if you want to understand how intense is this attack by Israel on Iran. To some extent, such comparison will have to be done and even then the comparison falls short. One theory says that India had accidentally attacked some of Pakistan's nuclear side as well.  Israel has intentionally attacked directly the place where Iran was testing its nuclear weapons. You will be able to see it here on the map.  This is the city you see in Iran , let me zoom in a little for you. It is the capital of Iran.  Here in Tehran, there has been an attack.  Who was the commander of his Revolutionary Guard Corps.  His Chief of Armed Forces was.  Both of them died here.  There is a very important location in the south below Tehran named Natans. You will be able to see this here.  These are Iran's uranium enrichment sites. These people keep their sand refugees here.  This side is being told.  Israel has been hit multiple times.  The actual damage at ground level will be known after some time. Apart from all this, Iran's missile stores have been attacked at many places. Iran's air defence systems in many places were primarily S300, yes, just like India has S400.  The S300 used by Iran is a predecessor to the S400. Compared to S400, the range of S300 missile defense system is quite weak, 100 to 150 km.  It is around.  And at the same time, it cannot stop the high-end missiles and advanced missiles. And it is being said that Israel also destroyed Iran's missile defense at many places. And this video of Iran became very viral on this particular social media. Here you will see an amazing video. Now here you might say but what is happening?  There are so many explosions constantly and there are no missiles falling from above.  What is this happening?  Look, no missile fell here from above.  It is being told that there are many agents of Mossad on the ground level in Iran and as soon as the Israeli air force attacked from above, they carried out an air to ground attack and simultaneously, the Mossad agents on the ground in Iran got activated and they caused explosions at many of their ballistic missile sites in Iran where they store these missiles and you can see the result of that here, constant explosions one after the other, the sound that is being heard, these Iranian missiles are getting destroyed in an underground facility, and after carrying out such a big attack.  I mean this is war.  You should not take it for granted that like last time, Iran has attacked Israel.  Israel attacked Iran. Then both of them cooled down and sat down.  No. This is a proper declaration of war.  Now the matter will not stop here.  Iran and its proxies will do everything to damage Israel.  And Israel has asked a question to the whole world.  In a video by the Israeli Defense Forces.  These people uploaded a 25-second video and told the world that history is watching you. Now the whole world will have to decide. All the important countries are included in it.  Be it China, India, US, Japan, pretty much everyone.  European Union, everyone, who will you stand with in times like this? Check out this 25 second clip.  History is watching. [MUSIC] Be Fighting Futurev [MUSIC] [MUSIC] Let's decide before it's too late.  This is Israel's message to the entire world and the US has decided for now that brother, we do not want to get involved in all this.  Now here, of course, some people will ask me this that during the time of Operation Sindoor, I had told you in a video that it was the interest of the US that Operation Sindoor should stop. India should not destroy all the airbuses of Pakistan badly. Because tomorrow it is possible that the US Air Force may use these airbases against Iran.  You all might remember that I told you this in the video.  This is my video which is four weeks old.  Nuclear war between India and Pakistan stopped by Trump.  I had initially made this based on Trump's claim. And please listen to this part. Now USA's fear was that India was destroying the runways of Pakistan's Airbuses.  And the US military has made an eventual plan for war with Iran.  I am not saying that this war is about to start now.  On the contrary, recently Trump had also scolded Nathan Yau for repeatedly wanting to wage war with Iran and for causing many setbacks to Israel.  But the US military has also made a plan somewhere about what they will do if there is a war with Iran tomorrow.  In that plan, the US military is sure that they will be using Pakistan's airbuses.  Pakistan 's air strips etc. came in handy for the USA in some way or the other.  Now this is what I said four-five weeks ago. Nowadays you will see this thing being mentioned in many news articles. For example here you can see Pakistan's position during a US back and Israeli bat strike on Iran's wood matter immally.  The US may be seeking to ensure that Pakistan offers covered help such as use of its military bases and assets during a wider regional conflation that could involve Iranian proxies in the Middle East.  So you guys can understand.  See, USA was very worried about Pakistan's air bases. Now this matter is being discussed openly. USA's defense analysts are also saying that the way India was destroying Pakistan 's airbases one by one, suddenly alarm bells started ringing in Washington DC that a big war is pending with us. What will we do in that?  Asim Munir will get an excuse to escape, what should I do?  India destroyed our air bases. How will I be able to help you guys now ?  So see, the US will put pressure on Pakistan.  If Pakistan does not come immediately in support of USA, then talks are going on to call Asim Munir.  They will cancel the parades etc in the US and say that this is fake news.  Nothing, we never invited Asim Munir.  And apart from that maybe again see US Works in Mysterious Ways.  Even the loans of Pakistan that were approved by IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank will have silent riders put on them that how can this money be spent?  Look, let me tell you clearly.  Recently, people in India got quite worried after seeing that billions of dollars of the World Bank are going to Pakistan and so many billions will go.  Let me tell you clearly, in this world no one helps anyone for free. There is no free lunch.  If loans worth billions of dollars are suddenly being given to Pakistan.  During Operation Sindoor, the US was so much involved, you know, these people themselves claim that they were trying not to damage Pakistan any further.  That's it now.  There is only and only US self interest behind it.  Obviously Donald Trump wanted that Israel should not carry out this attack. I met Marco Robbio, who is the current Foreign Minister of USA. Look at his statement.  He said that tonight Israel has taken unilateral action against Iran.  We are not involved in this strike. So here the first thing is that the US is saying this to Iran.  Look, whatever attack has been carried out has been done by Israel.  We didn't.  Donâ€™t target us.  Do not target those who are our base in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia , UAE, Qatar. And let me also tell you that if this conflict happens on a large scale, which it seems will definitely happen.  Do n't be surprised that Indians have purchased houses worth crores in UAE or you know here in Gulf. They have Golden Card and Golden Visa. Ran away and came back to India for safety. Because when Iran decides that now it is okay, then it is a matter of do or die.  Now it is simple that either we will fight or you know everything will happen and in that case it will impact the entire region.  Now what impact will this have on India, I will have to tell you in a separate video.  But for now we have discussed that Israel has launched a major attack on Iran.   We will have to see what Iran's response is and on that basis we will tell you whether a big war is going to start in this part of the world or not.
