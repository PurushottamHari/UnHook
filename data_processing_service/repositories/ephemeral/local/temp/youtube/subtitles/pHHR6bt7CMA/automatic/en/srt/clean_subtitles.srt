I hope you all are doing very well. My name is Siddhant Agnihotri. Welcome to Study Gloss.  So many congratulations and thank God that exactly as I told you, I told you.  Is it okay?  that this is what was going to happen and this is what happened.  Cease fire has been declared.  Ok?  The ceasefire has been done and Iran has confirmed it and now the last missile has been fired by Iran.  Although the official confirmation is still awaited but it has happened now.   Let me tell you.  Look, this was what I was going to tell you.  I will tell you step by step.  By the way, was it completed within 12 days?  Ok?   I will tell you sequentially.  And I was going to tell you that there will be a ceasefire. But now this is coming confirmed.  Right now I was watching the live updates of Times of India. In that, Iran has already confirmed that we fired the last round of missiles and we have done ceasefire with Israel.  Now America had nothing to do with it.  So let's talk.  So first of all look at combined NCERT, I have already told you everything about the whole of Iran in this very important history. So you can avail combined NCERT of Geography, Polity, History and Economy. Use NCERT 80 coupon code.  We have reopened it. Ok?  Description link is in the comment box. So this war starts 12 days ago, on 12th June. When Israel attacked Iran.  Then Iran attacked Israel.  Then all this continued.  Israel said that we have to end the nuclear program. Iran said, brother, leave at the earliest opportunity. We don't have anyone.  So it all started like this when I said here that these are not being done as per NPT and we are finding something suspicious. They have enriched their nuclear power up to 60%. Uranium has been enriched.  That's why Israel attacked in Fordo. But you know that break it, break it, he is famous so you cannot kill him like this because he is below.  So after that America said okay we will join your war and then you know the day before yesterday America used the bunker buster bomb under Operation Midnight Hammer.  Ok? Now what has happened is that the report came because Iran had said that we will take revenge. Around 1000 people have died in Iran and also in Israel, friends, the official figure is 30-40 but I think more people have died because in the missile fired by Iran just now, three Israelis have lost their lives. So, there have been quite a few casualties and for the first time Iran and Israel have come into direct conflict.  So then the news was that within 48 hours, Israel and Iran would attack America.  Then friends, last night a news came that who attacked Qatar? Iran and Qatar have already been informed. America was also informed in advance and after this, as I had told in my previous lecture, Donald Trump posted a long tweet saying thank you for informing us in advance.  Ok ?  Now friends, this news is coming that finally the ceasefire has happened and this was bound to happen. I said that Iran would fire a few missiles.  It will satisfy your ego.  So this 12 day war continued for 12 days. For 12 days and after that ceasefire was imposed. Now they are running much smaller. Now see, as soon as this happened, Iran had earlier said that there was no ceasefire because Donald Trump had announced it earlier.  Now what Donald Trump said, I want to tell you how it actually happened?  See Donald Trump's tweet. Look, Donald Trump is a crazy man.   He is an absolutely crazy man.  He is crazy.  And that means his stomach can't digest anything. Ok?  And the thing is that I think the draft is ready.  If it would have happened then it would not have happened in excitement that you would tell me in advance. So Donald Trump said congratulations to everyone.  I want to congratulate everyone.  Now both Israel and Iran have agreed that there is a complete and total ceasefire between them. After 6 hours, after 6 hours from now, Israel and Iran will stop bombing each other and after that the war will end. Iran is after 12 hours because Israel is after 6 hours and Israel and Iran are after 12 hours, so as it was like in Operation Sindoor when DGMO of Pakistan had called, even then they had fired bullets and sent drones, so it is obvious that it takes some time for understanding to happen, that is why Iran has fired the last barrage of missiles. Then he said, look, the entire world saw the 12-day war and in every ceasefire the other side remains peaceful and respectful.  I am telling you exactly what Don Trump tweeted, meaning we will now understand his words that everything should work well.  I would like to congratulate both the countries.  Both Israel and Iran have a lot of stamina, courage and intelligence. Which we will now know under 12 days war. But God bless Israel.  God bless Iran. God bless the Middle East.  God bless the United States of America.  God bless the world. This man is such a big jerk.  That means, let us assume that the one who slapped, why should I say this much that you have hit me.  It has caused havoc. After that you are saying that it was very good.  You are clapping, which means beat me hard and then beat me to death.  No problem son, it happens.  It keeps happening.  Donald Trump has said this literally.  And he did the same in Pakistan and India too.  Ok ?  God bless him.  God bless you.  Hey bhaiya, God bless you.  First of all, bless yourself well.  So it is said here that the entire world will be destroyed.  This will happen , that will happen.  Okay, look, since we are talking about Donald Trump, it is obvious that he announced in advance the draft that was to be written in the paper.  But if you look at this, you start getting hints.  The foreign minister of Iran is Abbas Sarakshi.  He has said each and every thing. He said, look, we would like to thank the armed forces of Iran because they fought till the end. This is exactly what I told you, this is what was going to happen.  And they fought till the last and both of them showered missiles on each other. But we fired the last missile so thank you for it.  Now it becomes clear that there is a ceasefire between Iran and Israel because this is a very big statement and he said that look, the military operations have been very powerful. We have punished Israel and we fired missiles at them at 4:00 am today in which three Israeli people have been killed and I want to thank all the Iranians and you defended this country and fought till the last blood. So this is a very good thing.  So, in a way, you say this only after fighting till the last moment when the war is over that okay brother, thank you for coming.  You saw this scene.  I saw this dance and it was great.   Is it okay?  So this is it.  Then friends we see that Arachi also said that look in Tehran, there is no interest in engaging further.  Ok?  Now Israel is illegal and until Israel stops bombing, we will not stop bombing. So we will escalate until the Israeli bomber arrives.  That is why Donald Trump said that Israel will cease fire in 6 hours because the issue of Israel is over. See what happened.  I will tell you how big the geopolitics is and what game was played here.  America has already informed Iran and Iran is openly saying that we have removed the uranium. All our highly nerd rhenium was, brother, the main stuff has been removed.  So kill me, that money is nothing.  That section is kill it, finish it.  Now America has finished it to show the world.  He killed me after telling me. Because America wants a deal with Iran.  America wants Iran's oil. I have told you this before also.  The same era wants Iran to remain under America and maybe a deal can be reached.  Now, this is about Donald Trump getting the Peace Prize.  Now see, I will get another chance.  He has already said that no matter how many wars I stop through tweets, I won't get it.  I mean, this is the first person I have seen who is praising himself. So whatever is happening here, it was all a complete plan.  Now what is there in this is that Israel now knows that friend, look we have not got anything in return, friend, we did not get that much and this statement has also come that now the place where they have taken the new thing, where they have completed their shifting, we do not know where is that from, we don't know where the new uranium is now, so brother, your motive has been accomplished in front of the world, Israel had said that you and we have to end their nuclear program, it did not end but it has been accomplished in front of the world, America also helped you, so you do not have the face of Israel, they should attack because if this happens now then Israel will again be in a very big siege.  So Israel now had no choice but to cease fire.  So, that is why in the first 6 hours Israel will open ceasefire.  And when Israel does it, Iran will say that we do not want to escalate at all.  Just like India had told Pakistan that we will not escalate.  But if Pakistan attacks, we will also attack.  So this is a very good news for the whole world. But it was said earlier that no agreement has been reached yet.  Ok?  The agreement will happen only when Israel stops bombing. Ok?  And Donald Trump has praised Israel and, as we have, Israel and Iran very highly.  And after that Tehran has agreed that it is okay.  Now look, Qatar itself has attacked the American airbase in Qatar.  Iran has attacked Qatar's base and I told you that Qatar will do the mediation.  I had told you in my previous lecture that this is where mediation will be done. They have no problem with that, okay friend, Iran had informed Qatar also earlier. America was also informed in advance that an attack was going to be carried out.  Early notice was given.  So what does this mean?  This is how an attack happens.  Are?  In the First Battle of Panipat or the First Battle of Tarain, Mohammad Ghori did not attack Prithviraj Chauhan after informing him.  He had attacked him all of a sudden. Ok?  So always remember that the Second Battle of Tarain took place.  Ok? So it has been said that Iran is saying that now we will talk in Tehran and our talks will take place there.  So this is it. At present, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has told many people against American aggression that he will not do this.  This explosion or this war, you burnt our buildings and turned them into smoke.  We did not harm anyone.  We will not tolerate harassment of any kind. But friends, the truth is that Iran will have to come to the table.  Iran does not have that much power right now.  The day it gains power, Iran will wreak havoc.  But right now Iran does not have that much power. Because if America enters and Iran knows that it has created a State of Hormuz, that is what I am telling you, sometimes you feel bad for Iran brother, it has not done even a single thing that would bring it into the war on a fake basis, neither did it attack by becoming a State of Hormuz, nor did its proxies attack American bases, rather Israel and America caused havoc, Iran killed people without any reason, so that is it, whatever else happens friends, I will tell you, at the moment this is the big news that the ceasefire has happened and now you just wait for the announcement and this is what I had told you as well and this is what has happened.  I had just said that it may last a little longer, seven to eight days, but this ended in one day, so it is a good thing brother, it is very important that the war stops, stay happy and keep reading this Siddhant Agnihotri signing off
