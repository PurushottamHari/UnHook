Hello, welcome to Career 247. I am Prashant Dhawan. Now the world knew that the US would launch a strike on Iran if not today then tomorrow, but no one expected that it would do it in this manner, and it would do it so soon because Trump had asked for some time, they were evaluating it, there was talk that he might have a meeting with Iran before the strikes, but suddenly the USA surprised the entire world by attacking so quickly and the images of this situation room when this attack was happening have been released recently.  Here you can see the USA Generals and Marco Rubio is sitting behind them.  JD Vance is sitting here. Interestingly, let me tell you that the US media has reported that JD Vance had told Donald Trump that in my opinion Iran should not be attacked. Israel would engage the USA in a war that we would not be able to recover from for decades.  This was a warning from Jedi Vais. Marco Robbio is also said to have the same viewpoint.  Pead Hexeth who has a Kaffir tattoo on his biceps, he is being told that he should attack.  The US Generals were waiting for the command to tell them what decision is to be taken at the end. US President Trump, Nobel Peace Prize nominee Donald Trump had to take a decision at the end. He told his generals to attack and after that USA took this big step, everyone was nervous and now that this attack has happened, the world is nervous to a great extent. Nervous because we don't know yet what Iran will do?  Will Spray of Hermes be choked?  Will Iran attack the US now ?  Because let me tell you this, listen carefully to what I am going to say. If Iran attacks the US, then remember that the US is a NATO country and is also the leader of NATO countries.  He is the unofficial leader of NATO countries.  If Iran attacks USA, in that case UK, Germany, France, all these countries will compel and the whole western world will together attack Iran.  Today we are at a very important juncture in history and world leaders are reacting in different ways. Regarding the US attack. I will also come to Pakistan's reaction. There, Asim Munir, his government, his journalists, everyone is in shock as to what has happened. Trump made a joke of us. But first of all I want to show you what reaction Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India has given to this attack.  Here you will be able to see Modi ji's tweet.  It is being said that he has recently talked to the President of Iran.  When I'm recording this video like that.  Till now PM Modi has not spoken to Donald Trump. But now as you all know, when it is day here and it is night in the USA, perhaps it is possible that at night India may receive a phone call from Trump or the US Government. That will happen later.  But for now, PM Modi has first talked to the President of Iran.  This entire situation has been discussed in detail.  It is being said that the President of Iran and the PM of India talked for 45 minutes.  Iran has also said in this call that look, whatever happens, we have always considered India a friend and such things will happen in today's time because the path that Iran is going on now, somewhere or the other they will have to remind the you know countries that see whatever happens in future, you know, you should remember that we have always helped you, now some people say that yes we get oil from Iran, again look, India has not purchased any oil from Iran in the last six years because of sensations.  We must have purchased many times more oil from USA compared to Iran.  India's main concern in Iran, our main interest , is the Chabahar Port.  Apart from that we are not dependent on Iran for oil at all.  Yes, Iran chokes the State of Hermouse. He shuts it down.  It will have an impact on India.  So look here, India has said that we are deeply concerned at the recent escalations.  We want de-escalation to happen as soon as possible so that the world moves towards dialogue diplomacy, but it does not seem that Iran will be able to do so. Iran will have to attack USA one way or the other. These attacks happen through revelations, Hasbollah does it, they get the attack done through proxy or their people go and do something internally in USA, we do not know now. Now we will see what discussions are going on in Pakistan, what are their journalists, senior most journalists discussing here, their government has openly condemned this attack. Pakistani government was surprised that as soon as Asim Munir met him, as soon as he reached Pakistan, he directly attacked Iran here and at such a time, just a day before, the US government had officially nominated Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, I mean I was laughing so much, it is not that there is a Nobel Prize in literature or anything, it is not that this man has brought so much peace in the world, the Nobel Peace Prize for him, the very next day Trump did bombing with B-2 bomber.  Let us give you a decision on Iran which was not taken before by Biden, Obama and even George Bush had not taken, so obviously Pakistan is in shock and this conversation is going on in Pakistani circles today. One problem in this for Pakistan is that just a day ago Pakistan nominated Trump Sir for the Nobel Peace Prize, now the reason for this was his role in ending the war between Pakistan and India. But you see how big a problem Trump has created for Pakistan, that a day before Pakistan nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, and he did not even wait for 24 hours and attacked Iran. This line is being discussed a lot in Pakistan. Trump has basically used Pakistan.  Hee Fold Pakistan did not even wait for 24 hours. As soon as this matter of Nobel Prize came up , Trump went in front of the media and said, yes, I deserve it.  Nobel Prize: I have done so many good works, and I told you Trump is making a cover that after seeing what I am going to do on Iran, don't forget what all I have done before this.  He literally used Pakistan properly and then directly launched a big attack on Iran.  It was an amazing strategy.  That means Donald Trump, I would say, works according to cut throat competition. He does not care about others.  And I think that other leaders will also understand this. Trump knows that no one can harm him because he is the President of USA.  So he will use all his power to see how he can generate mileage for himself from the rest of the world and other leaders. Now here you people will ask me a question that ok, in a way Donald Trump has put Pakistan on an international basis and the Pakistanis themselves are saying that he has made a joke of it.  Did n't wait even for 24 hours.  But Pakistan was not secretly helping USA against Iran.  Look what Pakistan was doing, these people were assisting the US in spying on Iran's air defense system. This has been proved to a large extent. If you look at the posts of Open Source Intelligence Network, they have explained categorically how Pakistan quietly gave entry to USA's BACN, Battlefield Airborne Communication Node, in one of its countries and said that okay you can spy on Iran.  USA has used Pakistan to this extent.  During the rest of the attacks, no details have come out regarding whether Pakistan helped the USA.  I think Pakistan's Asim Munir was equally surprised that I did not even reach Pakistan.  Actually right now Asim was meeting Munir Edwan.  I was meeting some other leader.  Suddenly USA has attacked Iran.  And Iran will definitely be very angry with Pakistan today. But I will say this in a roundabout way that Iran should also have thought that a country which can do all this with Afghanistan, a country which literally survives because of the help of USA, be it IMF or World Bank, why wouldn't it spy for USA and many times when Iran raised the issue of Kashmir, they should have thought why they are spoiling their relations with India for the sake of Pakistan, somewhere I would say that Iran's policy regarding India and Pakistan had a big flaw in it.  They thought that since they are OIC members and are Islamic countries, Pakistan will support them.  But the end is now in front of you today.  First Pakistan gave intelligence input to USA.  Now when USA has attacked, Pakistan is saying that we had no idea.  We do n't even know what happened and when.  And again, this post, here even India has not made such a post like Pakistan.  Why?  Because we never nominated Trump for the Nobel Prize. Pakistan is forced to openly condemn the US attacks on the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He has said that if there is escalation then anything can happen.  The situation will get worse. International law must be applied here. All these things have been done here by Pakistan.  But again it is too little too late.  Which is what Trump wanted.  Again I told you earlier.  Trump knew he would not get the Nobel Prize.   All he wanted was some international praise from somewhere which he could use to tell his people that if I have done this, then remember that before this I have also done such work for which countries have nominated me for the Nobel Peace Prize. And now Trump will repeat the same thing in his mid-term elections. But again we have to see what Iran's reaction is going to be.  Remember, if Iran attacks the US, NATO will get involved here.  So, there will be many developments and many updates coming up.  I will keep bringing updated videos for you. And finally a very important message for you all, India needs data scientists today.  That is why you must have noticed that the IITs of our country have also started offering certificate programmes related to data science and the reason for this is very simple.  The global economy is now largely data driven.  Unless this company has proper information about the data, the company cannot progress further. And that is why you must have noticed that almost every startup today wants a data scientist and you have the opportunity to make a career for yourself in this important global economy by becoming a data scientist yourself as a data scientist the doors of the whole world are open for you, you can work in any company like ICICI Bank, American Express, Accenture because frankly you will find the requirement of data scientists everywhere and Career 247 brings you our flagship Data Science and Machine Learning with Generative AI course.
