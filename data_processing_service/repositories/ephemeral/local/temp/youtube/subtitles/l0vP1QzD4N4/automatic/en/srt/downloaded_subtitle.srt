00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,200
Hello, welcome to Career 247. I am

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,240
Prashant Dhawan. Now the world knew that the US would launch

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,440
a strike on Iran if not today then tomorrow, but no

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,119
one expected that it would do it in this manner,

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,760
and it would do it so soon because

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,000
Trump had asked for some time, they were evaluating it, there was

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,560
talk that

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,519
he might have a meeting with Iran before the

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,679
strikes, but suddenly the USA surprised the entire world by

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,920
attacking so quickly

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,920
and the images of this situation room

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
when this attack was happening have been

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,559
released recently.  Here you can see the

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,480
USA Generals and Marco

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,079
Rubio is sitting behind them.  JD Vance is sitting here.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
Interestingly, let me tell you that the

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,800
US media has reported that

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,440
JD Vance had told Donald Trump that in

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,320
my opinion Iran should not be attacked.

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Israel would engage the USA in a war

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,640
that we would not be

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,719
able to recover from for decades.  This was a warning from Jedi Vais.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
Marco Robbio is also said to have the same

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,000
viewpoint.  Pead Hexeth who

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,240
has a Kaffir tattoo on his biceps,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
he is being told that he should attack.  The

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,640
US Generals were waiting for the

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,720
command to tell them

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,200
what decision is to be taken at the end. US President

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,040
Trump, Nobel Peace Prize nominee Donald

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
Trump had to take a decision at the end. He

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,400
told his generals to attack and

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,119
after that USA took this big step,

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,759
everyone was nervous and now that this attack has

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,240
happened, the world is nervous to a great extent.

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,400
Nervous because we don't know yet

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,960
what Iran will do?  Will Spray of Hermes be

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,960
choked?  Will Iran attack the US now

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,360
?  Because let me tell you this,

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,400
listen carefully to what I am going to say.

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,439
If Iran attacks the US, then

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,040
remember that the US is a NATO country and is

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:55,040
also the leader of NATO countries.  He

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,000
is the unofficial leader of NATO countries.  If Iran

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,880
attacks USA, in that case

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,240
UK, Germany, France, all these countries will compel

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,439
and the whole western world will together

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,280
attack Iran.  Today we are

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,520
at a very important juncture in history

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,920
and world leaders are reacting in different ways.

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,080
Regarding the US attack.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,239
I will also come to Pakistan's reaction.

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,480
There, Asim Munir, his government, his

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,400
journalists, everyone is in shock as to what has happened.

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,239
Trump made a joke of us.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
But first of all I want to show you

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,840

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,680
what reaction Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India has given to this attack.  Here

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,760
you will be able to see Modi ji's tweet.  It is being said

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,440
that he has recently

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,440
talked to the President of Iran.  When I'm

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,519
recording this video like that.  Till now

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,080
PM Modi has not spoken to Donald Trump.

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
But now as you all know, when it is

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,720
day here and it is night in the USA,

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,800
perhaps it is possible that at night India may receive

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,040
a phone call from Trump or the US Government.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,599
That will happen later.  But for

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,640
now, PM Modi has first talked to the

70
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,800
President of Iran.  This entire

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,599
situation has been discussed in detail.  It is being said that the

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,000
President of Iran and the

73
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,319
PM of India talked for 45 minutes.  Iran has

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,959
also said in this call that look, whatever

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,440
happens, we have always considered India a friend

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,040
and such things will happen in today's time because the

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,280
path that Iran is going on now,

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,519
somewhere or the other they will have to remind the you know countries that

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,040
see whatever

80
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,040
happens in future, you know, you should remember that we have always

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,440
helped you, now some people say that

82
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,319
yes we get oil from Iran, again look,

83
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,120
India has not purchased any oil from Iran in the last six years

84
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,440
because of sensations.  We must have

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,640
purchased many times more oil from USA

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,200
compared to Iran.  India's

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,000
main concern in Iran, our main interest

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,319
, is the Chabahar Port.  Apart from that

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,440
we are not dependent on Iran for oil at

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,200
all.  Yes, Iran chokes the State of Hermouse.

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,360
He shuts it down.  It

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,239
will have an impact on India.  So look here,

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
India has said that we are deeply concerned at

94
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,280
the recent escalations.  We want de-escalation to happen as soon

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,439
as possible so that the

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
world moves towards dialogue diplomacy, but it does not seem

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,879
that Iran will be able to do so. Iran will have to attack USA one way or the other. These attacks happen through

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,120

99
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,599
revelations, Hasbollah does it, they get the

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,759
attack done through proxy or

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,160
their people go and do something internally in USA, we do not know now.

102
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,079
Now we will see

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
what discussions are going on in Pakistan, what are

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,560
their journalists, senior most

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,479
journalists discussing here,

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,600
their government has openly condemned

107
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,479
this attack.

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,160
Pakistani government was surprised that as soon as

109
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,320
Asim Munir met him, as soon as he

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,639
reached Pakistan, he

111
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,080
directly attacked Iran here

112
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,960
and at such a time, just a day before, the US

113
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,520
government had officially nominated

114
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, I

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,840
mean I was laughing so much, it is not that there is a

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,800
Nobel Prize in literature or anything, it is not that

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,040
this man has brought so much peace

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,040
in the world, the Nobel Peace Prize for him, the very

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
next day Trump did bombing with B-2 bomber.  Let us

120
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,080
give you a

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,039
decision on Iran which was not taken before by Biden,

122
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,039
Obama and even George Bush had

123
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,440
not taken, so

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,960
obviously Pakistan is in shock and this conversation is

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,639
going on in Pakistani

126
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,199
circles today. One problem in this for Pakistan is that

127
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,080
just a day

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,400
ago Pakistan nominated Trump Sir for the Nobel Peace Prize,

129
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,120
now the reason for this was his

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,960
role in ending the war between Pakistan and India.

132
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
But you see

133
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,639
how big a

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,440
problem Trump has created for Pakistan, that a day

135
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,360
before Pakistan nominated him

136
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
for the Nobel Peace Prize, and he did not even wait for 24 hours

137
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,000
and attacked Iran.

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,240
This line is being discussed a lot in Pakistan.

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,320
Trump has basically

140
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,880
used Pakistan.  Hee Fold

141
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,759
Pakistan did not even wait for 24 hours.

142
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,000
As soon as this matter of Nobel Prize came up

143
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,520
, Trump went in front of the media and said,

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
yes, I deserve it.  Nobel

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,080
Prize: I have done so many good works, and

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
I told you Trump is making a cover that after

147
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,120

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,600
seeing what I am going to do on Iran, don't forget what all I have done before this.  He

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,080
literally used

150
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,400
Pakistan properly and then directly launched a

151
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
big attack on Iran.  It

152
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,560
was an amazing strategy.  That means Donald Trump, I would

153
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,479
say, works according to cut throat competition.

154
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
He does not care about others.  And I

155
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,120
think that other leaders will also understand this.

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
Trump knows that no one

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
can harm him because he is the President of

158
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,160
USA.  So he will use all his power to see

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,120
how he can

160
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,120
generate mileage for himself from the rest of the world and other leaders.

161
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,440
Now here you people will ask me a question

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
that ok, in a

163
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,520
way Donald Trump has put Pakistan on an international basis

164
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,759
and the Pakistanis themselves are saying

165
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,000
that he has made a joke of it.  Did

166
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,000
n't wait even for 24 hours.  But Pakistan was

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,960
not secretly helping USA against

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,639
Iran.  Look what Pakistan was doing,

169
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,680
these people were assisting the US in spying on Iran's air defense

170
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,680
system.

171
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,440
This has been proved to a large extent.

172
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,440
If you look at the

173
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,599
posts of Open Source Intelligence Network,

174
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,680
they have

175
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,039
explained categorically how Pakistan

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,840
quietly gave entry to USA's BACN, Battlefield

177
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,080
Airborne Communication Node,

178
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,720
in one of its countries and said that okay you can

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,360
spy on Iran.  USA has

180
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,919
used Pakistan to this extent.  During the rest of the attacks,

181
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,080

182
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,680
no details have come out regarding whether Pakistan helped the

183
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,000
USA.  I think Pakistan's Asim

184
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,840
Munir was equally surprised that I did not

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,240
even reach Pakistan.  Actually right now

186
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,160
Asim was meeting Munir Edwan.  I was meeting some other

187
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,160
leader.  Suddenly USA has

188
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,560
attacked Iran.  And Iran will

189
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,720
definitely be very angry with Pakistan today.

190
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,000
But I will

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,720
say this in a roundabout way that Iran should also have thought that a

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,080
country which can do all this with Afghanistan, a

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,479
country which literally survives because of the help of USA, be it

194
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,879
IMF or World

195
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,440
Bank, why wouldn't it spy for USA

196
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,440
and many times when Iran raised the issue of Kashmir,

197
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,599
they should have thought why they are

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,599
spoiling their relations with India

199
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
for the sake of Pakistan,

200
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,560
somewhere I would say that Iran's policy

201
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,400
regarding India and Pakistan had a big

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
flaw in it.  They thought that since they are

203
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,520
OIC members and are Islamic countries,

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,759
Pakistan will support them.  But the end is now in

205
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,080
front of you today.  First Pakistan

206
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,919
gave intelligence input to USA.  Now when

207
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,120
USA has attacked, Pakistan is saying that

208
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
we had no idea.  We do

209
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,519
n't even know what happened and when.  And again, this post,

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,519
here even

211
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,320
India has not made such a post like Pakistan.  Why?  Because

212
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,159
we never nominated Trump for the Nobel Prize.

213
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,360
Pakistan is

214
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,519
forced to openly condemn the

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,760
US attacks on the nuclear

216
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,000
facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

217
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,000
He has said that if there is escalation

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,640
then anything can happen.  The situation will get worse.

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920
International law must be applied here.

220
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
All these things have been done here

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,360
by Pakistan.  But again it is too

222
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,959
little too late.  Which is what Trump wanted.  Again

223
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
I told you earlier.  Trump

224
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,320
knew he would not get the Nobel Prize.   All

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,880
he wanted was some

226
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,800
international praise from somewhere which he could use

227
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,279
to tell his people

228
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,760
that if I have done this, then remember that

229
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,839
before this I have also done such work

230
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,240
for which countries have nominated me for the Nobel Peace Prize.

231
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,399
And now Trump will repeat the same

232
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
thing in his mid-term elections.

233
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,000
But again we have to see

234
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,800
what Iran's reaction is going to be.  Remember,

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,560
if Iran attacks the US, NATO will get

236
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,080
involved here.  So, there will

237
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,720
be many developments and many updates

238
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,680
coming up.  I will keep bringing updated videos for you.

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,160
And finally a very important message for you all,

240
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,560
India

241
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,760
needs data scientists today.  That is why you must have noticed that the

242
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,760
IITs of our country have also started offering

243
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,760
certificate programmes related to data science

244
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,880
and the reason for this is

245
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,360
very simple.  The global economy is now

246
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,519
largely data driven.  Unless this

247
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,760
company has proper information about the data, the

248
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,839
company cannot progress further.

249
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
And that is why you must have noticed that almost every

250
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,800
startup today wants a data scientist

251
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,440
and you have the opportunity to make a career for

252
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,079
yourself in this important global economy

253
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,040
by becoming a data

254
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,040
scientist yourself as a data scientist the

255
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,560
doors of the whole world are open for you,

256
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,160
you can work in any company like ICICI Bank, American Express, Accenture

257
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,240

258
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,279
because frankly

259
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,760
you will find the requirement of data scientists everywhere and Career 247

260
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,399
brings you our flagship

261
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Data Science and Machine Learning with Generative

262
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,880
AI course.  We specifically

263
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,600
included generative AI here because today there is

264
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,160
no such thing as generative AI.  Data Science and Machine

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,480
Learning cannot be mastered and

266
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,959
hence our online course will run for 6 months.  There

267
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,720
are 260 hours of live classes here.

268
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,279
So let's see what happens.

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,519
Most of the courses that are available online these

270
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,519
days are offered by Google and Harvard for data science.

271
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
Mostly

272
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
you will get pre-recorded classes and

273
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,000
their quality is also not so good.

274
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,959
Where s when you get live classes.

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,440
You can talk to the teacher openly yourself.

276
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,000
Through a webcam or a microphone.  You will be

277
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,560
able to ask the question immediately that

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,200
when will this topic be taught in the syllabus?  What

279
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,320
tools do you need to learn?  You will be able to understand Pandas, Amazon,

280
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,640
Web Services, Jupiter properly

281
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
and then of course, under this course,

282
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,959
you will also do projects with us,

283
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,040
which will help you properly understand

284
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,640
how to actually use the skills.

285
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,200
So, what do you do here?

286
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,360
Simply

287
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,160
go to the comment section of the video you are watching.

288
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,120

292
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,320
obviously PG10 because if

293
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
you enter PG10 then you will

294
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,040
get a significant discount and you will be

295
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,519
able to save your hard earned money.  That's

296
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,399
it.  You have to apply here.

297
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,360
After that the Career 247 consultant will call you.

298
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,760
You can talk to them about the

299
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,079
eligibility for this course?  Is this

300
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,079
course for you?  And by the way, let me tell you that

301
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,399
if you are a working professional.  Right now

302
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,279
you are already working somewhere.  If you

303
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,480
want a better job, a better paying job, then

304
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,800
definitely you should do Data Science and

305
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,600
Machine Learning course.  It will really boost

306
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,920
your career.  Let me tell you that

307
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,519
mostly working professionals come to us.

308
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
Because the one who has not got a job yet

309
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,920
cannot understand what impact skilling

310
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,480
brings.  Who has worked somewhere once.

311
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,279
Only that person knows that the

312
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,600
more skilled you are the better you will be paid.

313
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,760
So our Data Science and Machine Learning with

314
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,360
GenII course is starting very soon.  The

315
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,360
first class will start in a few days.

316
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,519
If you want to

317
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,920
start your career in data science then join this

318
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,600
course.  And on this note, the

319
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,079
video ends.  Thank you for listening.  And

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,079
as I always say, may God watch over you.
