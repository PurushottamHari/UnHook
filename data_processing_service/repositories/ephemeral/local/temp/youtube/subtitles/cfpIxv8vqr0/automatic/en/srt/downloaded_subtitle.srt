00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,800
Ladies and gentlemen, Iran is under

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,039
attack and this time Russia and China

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,039
are angry.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
While most people think America is just

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,000
flexing its muscles again, what they

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,640
don't see is that this time the US is

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,760
not facing one weak nation. It's poking

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,760
two angry superpowers at the same time.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,520
Why? Because this isn't just about

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
nuclear weapons anymore. America and

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
Israel are openly trying to dethrone

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Iran's supreme leader and they're trying

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,040
to replace him with a western puppet

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
just like they've done before. And

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
history's witness to its actions. The

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,799
regime change regime change. US

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,119
President Donald Trump has mentioned the

20
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,360
possibility of regime change in Iran.

21
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,759
The Israeli prime minister was planning

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,000
an assassination of the Supreme Leader.

23
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,560
He attacked in the dead of night. These

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,880
pictures from Isvahan of the US assault

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,040
on Iranian nuclear sites. Order we

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,200
received from our commander-in-chief was

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,240
focused. It was powerful and it was

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,479
clear. We devastated the Iranian nuclear

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,479
program. Every time a leader stood up to

30
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,720
the west, America has dethroned that

31
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,640
leader and installed a western puppet to

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,079
favor their own requirements. They did

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
it in Iran to remove their prime

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
minister to protect their oil. They did

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
it in Chile to overthrow President

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,240
Salvador to protect American copper

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
mines. And in Guatemala, America

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,119
launched a military coup just to protect

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,600
the lands of an American banana company.

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,759
Operation PD success, the US sent the

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,360
military into Guatemala to overthrow the

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,200
government that is threatening American

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
interests in the region. These conflicts

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,760
also took on an international dimension

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
when US geopolitical and business

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,879
interests got involved, as they often

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,280
did. So, if America can go to war for a

48
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,160
banana, they'll absolutely go to war for

49
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,560
a nuclear bomb. But this time, Russia

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,080
and China might enter the fight. So the

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,959
question is, what the hell is happening

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,040
after the US attack on Iran? Why is Iran

53
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,480
so important for Russia and China? And

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,519
could this war escalate to a

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,519
full-fledged world war?

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,160
Before we move on, I want to quickly

57
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,760

[Music]

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
Let's start with the first question. Why

91
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,599
is Iran so so important for Russia and

92
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,439
China? On 22nd June 2025, the US Air

93
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,400
Force launched a strike on Iran's

94
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,640
nuclear sites.

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,920
A short time ago, the US military

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,560
carried out

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,359
massive precision strikes on the three

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,320
key nuclear facilities. Our objective

99
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,440
was the destruction of Iran's nuclear

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,919
enrichment capacity and a stop to the

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,440
nuclear threat posed by the world's

102
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,440
number one state sponsor of terror.

103
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,759
And this attack has pushed the world to

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,320
the edge again because now even Iran has

105
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,639
hit back at Israel. But this isn't just

106
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,639
about missiles anymore. Reports say that

107
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,800
US and Israel are now planning to

108
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,199
overthrow Iran's regime. And if that

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,479
happens, the world fears something much

110
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,040
bigger. Russia and China might enter the

111
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,800
war. Why? Because Iran isn't just

112
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
another country, guys. It is one of the

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
most important allies for both Russia

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,280
and China. And there are three powerful

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,160
reasons why Russia and China will not

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,400
let Iran fall. Well, if you remember

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,800
before the Russia Ukraine conflict, over

118
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,120
40% of the European Union's natural gas

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,280
imports came from Russia. This gas

120
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,160
primarily came through Nordstream 1,

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,000
Yamal Europe and Turkstream pipelines.

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
And if you look at the map, Nordstream 1

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,240
runs under the Baltic Sea connecting

124
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,320
Russia and Germany. Then the Yamal

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,479
Europe pipeline transports natural gas

126
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,800
from Russia to Europe via Belarus and

127
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,520
Poland. And the Turk stream natural gas

128
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,160
pipeline runs from Russia to Turkey

129
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,800
under the Black Sea. This pipeline has

130
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,720
two lines. One that supplies Turkey and

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
the other that extends to southeastern

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,080
and central Europe. And Russia used this

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,880
heavy dependency to cut off oil as soon

134
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,680
as Europe imposed sanctions. Long story

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,400
short, Russia cut oil supply by 80%. It

136
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,479
caused a global oil shortage and the oil

137
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,039
prices started shooting up. And if you

138
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,680
remember, this gave Russia such high

139
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,080
leverage that Russia actually made more

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,560
money after the sanctions than before

141
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,360
the sanctions. Look at this. Even after

142
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,199
all the sanctions and big EU speeches,

143
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,919
by June 2024, Europe still paid 8.7

144
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,520
billion to Russia for gas. And even as

145
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:27,199
of January 2025, Russia is still making

146
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:30,160
€231 million every single day.

147
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,360
Vladimir Putin is able to prop up his

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,919
economy despite those sanctions. Russia

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,560
continues to make a lot of money from

150
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,039
its energy exports. Over a decade of

151
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,880
sanctions have not worked. Russia's

152
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
economy has weathered the war and

153
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,759
sanctions much better than many Western

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,919
analysts forecast. But now, if America

155
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,880
places an American puppet as the Iranian

156
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,199
ruler, then Russia will lose this power.

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,199
Why? Because Iran holds the second

158
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,639
largest natural gas reserves in the

159
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,759
world with 34 trillion cubic m of oil,

160
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,599
which is roughly 16% of all global

161
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
reserves. But because of sanctions on

162
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,560
Iran, Iran only has pipelines in Iraq,

163
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,720
Turkey, and Armenia. No pipeline

164
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,720
currently reaches Europe directly. But

165
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,280
after the regime change, the West may

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
fund and initiate a pipeline from Iran

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,840
to all the way to Europe. In fact, over

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,160
the decades, Iran has already built a

169
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,319
web of IGAT pipelines or Iran gas trunk

170
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,440
lines. This pipeline proposes to move

171
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,680
gas from Kestan to Ilam to Kuristan to

172
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,319
Bazar. This pipeline was designed to

173
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,400
send gas to Turkey and from there into

174
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,160
Europe via Turkeykey's existing gas

175
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,599
grid. In fact, there was also a Persian

176
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
pipeline which was proposed to extend

177
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,880
IG89 into Turkey. And from Turkey, it

178
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,759
was further planned to expand to Greece,

179
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,479
Italy, and via branches to Austria,

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,400
Germany, France, and eventually Spain.

181
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,639
These routes are currently blocked by

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,360
sanctions. But if Iran's regime falls

183
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,360
and a pro-Western leader comes to power,

184
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,680
then there is a very high possibility

185
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,599
that these routes will be activated.

186
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,160
This will take a few years, but once

187
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,800
they're activated, Russia will lose its

188
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,360
billion dollar oil leverage over Europe.

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,520
Similarly, when it comes to China, China

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,879
is currently the largest buyer of

191
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,639
Iranian oil. In fact, as of 2025, China

192
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,120
imports around 90%, I repeat, 90% of

193
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
Iran's total oil exports. And several

194
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
independent reports even suggest that a

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,919
significant portion of these

196
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,120
transactions happen in yuan and not the

197
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,880
US dollar. So if you see this marks a

198
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,519
strategic shift in the global energy

199
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,519
trade and this is China's effort to

200
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
internationalize the yuan and it also

201
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,080
creates a rare opportunity for Beijing

202
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,160
to reduce the reliance on the US dollar

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,040
and build a parallel energy payment

204
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,720
ecosystem. However, if Iran's political

205
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,200
leadership were to shift significantly

206
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,959
towards the western aligned policies,

207
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,959
this arrangement could be disrupted

208
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,040
under the new governance. In such a

209
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,959
scenario, China may lose preferential

210
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
access and the United States and its

211
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,600
allies could regain dominant influence

212
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,279
over Iranian energy exports both in

213
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
terms of pricing and currency

214
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,080
denomination. This is the first reason

215
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,640
why China and Russia will go to great

216
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,959
lengths, even get aggressive if America

217
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,800
tries to dethrone Iran's leadership. The

218
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,600
second reason is China's greatest

219
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,920
nightmare. China's nightmare is a tiny

220
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,360
maritime passageway called the Strait of

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,760
Mala. This waterway is really, really

222
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,080
important. It fuels nations and it could

223
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,279
be this global superpower's biggest

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,760
weakness. This is the Malaca Strait. But

225
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,720
for countries like China, its importance

226
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,640
goes even further. It receives 80% of

227
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,200
its oil through here. This means it

228
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,200
relies on tankers successfully bringing

229
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,920
oil from the Middle East through the

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,680
Malaca Strait to keep its economy going.

231
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,240
This narrow sea lane lies between

232
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,279
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. And

233
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,600
right now 80% of China's entire trade

234
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,440
passes through the street of Mala. So if

235
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
America blocks this trade, it can

236
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
strangle the Chinese economy and block

237
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,240
oil from going to China during wartime.

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,920
So to end this nightmare, China has

239
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,079
initiated a monumental project called

240
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,320
the Belt and Road Initiative. And in

241
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
this initiative, Iran is emerging as the

242
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
most critical player. To address the

243
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Malaka straight vulnerability, China has

244
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,360
designed a direct land route which goes

245
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,000
from Shing Jang to Central Asia to Iran

246
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,560
to then Turkey and eventually the entire

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
Europe. If this route is built, then oil

248
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,120
and trade can directly happen between

249
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,000
Europe and China. And oil can easily go

250
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,000
from Iran to China. And China is so

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,800
serious about this route that China has

252
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,440
already invested $1.3 trillion into the

253
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,279
Belt and Road initiative. And Iran, if

254
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
you look at the map, is at the heart of

255
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,000
this trillion dollar project. Why?

256
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,000
Because Iran acts as the bridge directly

257
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
linking China to Europe. And without

258
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,560
Iran, China's strategic land route will

259
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,200
completely collapse. In fact, this is

260
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,279
just the beginning. This overland route

261
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,800
can actually slash China's shipping time

262
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,519
from 40 days by sea to just 15 to 20

263
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
days by land. So faster delivery means

264
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,440
Chinese goods will hit the European

265
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,680
markets quicker, cheaper, and more

266
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,160
competitively. So this isn't just a

267
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,399
backup plan. It's a shield. A shield for

268
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,880
China's oil security and a weapon for

269
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,040
its trade dominance. So if Iran

270
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
collapses, China's trillion dollar belt

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,120
and road investment goes down the drain.

272
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,279
And what's even worse is that China

273
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
could once again fall under the mercy of

274
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,399
the American global chokeold. This is

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
China's biggest nightmare. And this

276
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,120
brings us to the third reason. If Iran

277
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
falls, Russia will lose its southern

278
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,240
firewall. In simple words, Russia sees

279
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Iran as a strategic shield, its first

280
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,279
line of defense against NATO and the US

281
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,200
military influence from the south. Why?

282
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,279
Look at this. Iran sits at the

283
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,440
crossroads of three strategic zones.

284
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,760
Iraq, which is now home to US military

285
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
bases. Syria, which is now going pro-

286
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,560
west. And then we have the Persian Gulf

287
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,519
with US naval dominance via bases in

288
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,240
Bahin, Qatar and Kuwait. So if Iran

289
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,240
collapses or goes pro America, America

290
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
will gain a direct gateway to southern

291
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
Russia, the Caspian Sea, and the

292
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,440
underbelly of Central Asia where Russia

293
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,200
wants uncontested influence. And Russia

294
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,760
is so serious about the shield that

295
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,920
Russia and Iran have conducted 5,000

296
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,880
military drills, arms transfers, and

297
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,120
even intel exchanges. In fact, Iran even

298
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,680
lets Russian warships and supply vessels

299
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,639
dock and resupply at its ports. So, if

300
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,800
Iran goes pro- US, Russia will lose this

301
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,560
logistics hub and the American naval

302
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,279
presence could enter the Caspian or

303
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,279
Arabian Sea near the Russian turf. And I

304
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,959
don't think Putin is going to like it.

305
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,279
And the last reason for Russia to be

306
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,839
worried is military hardware synergy.

307
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,920
You see, Russia has sold Iran S300 air

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,000
defense systems to shield its nuclear

309
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,560
sites. They also share drone tech,

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
missile defense and cyber warfare tools.

311
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,040
And Iran even supplied drones to Russia

312
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,200
during the Russia Ukraine war. In fact,

313
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Russia has been using the Iranian Shahid

314
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,279
136 drones to attack Ukrainian

315
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,680
territories. These cheap drones save

316
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,440
Russia a fortune on air strikes which

317
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,680
would otherwise require millions of

318
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,240
dollars worth of missiles. So if Iran

319
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,839
falls, no more cheap drones for Russia,

320
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,279
no more swarm attacks. their

321
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,120
surveillance will break down and

322
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,440
Russia's cost per strike will shoot up

323
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,680
from thousands of dollars to millions of

324
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,600
dollars. So for Russia, Iran isn't just

325
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,720
an ally, it's a shield. And if that

326
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,480
shield breaks, NATO walks right through.

327
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
This is the reason why a regime change

328
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,240
in Thran won't just cost Russia

329
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,639
billions. It will also leave their

330
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,920
military, economy, and power wide open

331
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,320
for attack. So for Kremlin, letting Iran

332
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,639
fall is not a risk, it's a red line.

333
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,800
That is why Moscow will protect Thran

334
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,720
even if it means going to war. And

335
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,040
lastly for the Middle East if a

336
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
pro-western regime takes over Thran,

337
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,800
Hezbollah will lose its funding. The

338
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,279
Houthis will lose their funding and

339
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,519
Iraq's Shia militia will break apart.

340
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,680
And the result could be sectarian civil

341
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,000
wars, mass protest, regional

342
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,000
destabilization, and possibly a second

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Arab Spring that might haunt the world

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,639
for the next two decades. So what are

345
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
Russia and China expected to do? Well,

346
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,160
we don't know that yet because this

347
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,320
could range anywhere from a peaceful

348
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,560
veto at the United Nations all the way

349
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,120
to using weapons to protect Iran with a

350
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,199
full-fledged war. And if this escalates

351
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
into a full-blown war, it won't just be

352
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,519
Iran that bleeds. Oil prices will shoot

353
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,279
up, global inflation will rise, interest

354
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,120
rates could stay high for years, and

355
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,000
economies from India to Europe will

356
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,079
suffer. Not just militarily, but even at

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,160
the grocery store. Because we're talking

358
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,320
about supply chain collapsing, energy

359
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,399
shocks, refugee crisis, and cyber

360
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,880
warfare at a scale that is quite

361
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,279
unimaginable. And if nukes even enter

362
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,120
the conversation, every global power

363
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,279
will be forced to choose sides. Now,

364
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,440
that's not a regional war. That is the

365
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,880
perfect recipe for a world war. And what

366
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
we need to remember is that in every

367
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,959
century, humanity writes a few chapters

368
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,279
in blood, not because we must, but

369
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,279
because we refuse to learn. World War I

370
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,079
began with a bullet. World War II began

371
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,560
with a madman's ego. And a nuclear war

372
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,639
might just begin because of a madman's

373
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,480
pride. America may hold the world's

374
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
largest arsenal. Russia may have the

375
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
most warheads. China may control the

376
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,199
supply chain. But the truth is that in a

377
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,920
nuclear war, nobody wins. Only the

378
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,399
innocent bleed. And it all depends on

379
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,480
whether humanity will choose pride or

380
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,720
peace. And all we can hope for is that

381
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,160
this war doesn't escalate. That's all

382
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
