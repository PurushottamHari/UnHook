      "markdown_string": "# Learning Faster at Work: Coaching Session Insights\n\n## The Modern Professional’s Dilemma\n\nHow do you keep up with everything you need to learn while working full-time? This challenge becomes even more daunting when what you're learning is new, technical, and needs to be immediately applied to solve complex problems at work.\n\nAs a learning coach with over 13 years of experience working with thousands of professionals, I've found this to be one of the most common struggles people face. I personally spent years exploring this challenge myself, developing a system that allowed me to work 80+ hours per week as a junior doctor while running a full-time business and completing my master's degree—coming first in my program.\n\nThrough both personal experience and coaching others, I've discovered that many of our ingrained learning habits and approaches, while perhaps useful in the past, actually hinder our progress as working professionals trying to learn while maintaining demanding careers.\n\n## Julian's Story: A Case Study in AI Learning Overwhelm\n\nTo illustrate these insights, I want to share a coaching session I had with Julian, a recent university graduate working at a startup. Julian came to me because he needed to learn about AI quickly, despite having no technical background. His situation perfectly captures the three main challenges many professionals face:\n\n### 1. Lack of Structure\n\"Compared to university where there's a strict curriculum telling you what to do,\" Julian explained, \"when it comes to learning at a startup, there is no guide, no one telling you what to learn at what stage. I just feel a bit lost at times on what exactly I should be doing to get the most high yield for my learning.\"\n\n### 2. Information Overwhelm\n\"I just feel like there's new information coming out about AI every single day,\" he continued. \"There's a new YouTube video, new LinkedIn post saying AI can do this, there's a new AI tool or agent. It feels like there's so much knowledge in this field that if I don't keep up with it every single day, I'm going to fall behind very quickly.\"\n\n### 3. The Application Gap\n\"I feel like I'm trying to learn a lot about AI, but it's not translating to tangible results. Sometimes I can get a good conceptual understanding of how AI operates, but then I need to actually turn that into something in my job. Otherwise, it feels like the things I'm learning aren't actually leading to anything tangible.\"\n\n## The Root Cause: Why We Feel Overwhelmed\n\nThe feeling of overwhelm that Julian described—and that many professionals experience—has a specific neurological basis. Think of your existing knowledge as a network of connections in your brain. When new information comes in and you don't know how to think about it—you don't see how it connects to anything, you don't recognize patterns, you don't understand its impact or importance—your brain perceives this as overwhelm.\n\n**Overwhelm is your brain saying, \"I don't know what to do with this information.\"**\n\nContrast this with how an expert processes information. An expert looks at new information and doesn't feel overwhelmed because their brain knows how to categorize it. They can immediately see implications, recognize it as an extension of existing knowledge, or identify similarities to patterns they've already internalized.\n\nJulian, coming from a medical background, lacked the existing patterns to make sense of AI information. He was essentially trying to become an expert in something he had no foundational knowledge about—a recipe for constant overwhelm.\n\n## Two Approaches to Structured Learning\n\nBased on Julian's situation, I identified two primary approaches to tackling learning without formal structure:\n\n### 1. Problem-Based Learning (The Narrow Approach)\n\nThis method involves:\n- Starting with a specific problem you need to solve\n- Assessing your current knowledge against what's required to solve that problem\n- Identifying the specific gaps preventing you from solving it\n- Creating learning questions that, if answered, would fill those gaps\n- Progressively building knowledge through targeted learning\n\n**When to use this approach:**\n- When you need to deliver work results quickly\n- When you'll face similar problems repeatedly\n- When the learning will be highly transferable to future challenges\n\n**The drawback:** This approach builds expertise in narrow wedges rather than comprehensive understanding. If future problems require knowledge in different areas, you'll constantly be starting from scratch.\n\n### 2. Relevance-Based Learning (The Broad Approach)\n\nThis method focuses on:\n- Developing holistic expertise rather than solving immediate problems\n- Building foundational knowledge that enables you to handle diverse challenges\n- Following your curiosity and sense of relevance to guide learning\n- Creating concentric circles of understanding that expand outward\n\n**When to use this approach:**\n- When you need to make high-stakes decisions across diverse areas\n- When you have time to build robust foundational knowledge\n- When you're preparing for roles requiring comprehensive expertise\n\n**The advantage:** This creates the \"snowball effect\" of learning—the more you know, the easier it becomes to learn new information because you have more connection points.\n\n## The Concentric Learning Method\n\nFor Julian's situation—wanting to build comprehensive AI expertise without immediate deadline pressure—I recommended the relevance-based approach, specifically what I call \"concentric learning.\"\n\nThis method works by:\n1. Starting with the big picture (as Julian had begun with his mind map)\n2. Identifying the \"lowest hanging fruit\"—the concepts that feel most relevant and connectable to your current understanding\n3. Deepening knowledge in those areas until you start feeling overwhelmed\n4. Pivoting to other relevant areas when learning becomes difficult\n5. Gradually expanding your knowledge in concentric circles\n\n**The key insight:** The big-picture understanding (comprising about 10-20% of total knowledge) shapes your ability to understand the remaining 80-90%. Getting this foundation right is crucial because errors here propagate through all future learning.\n\n## Julian's Learning System Audit\n\nWhen I examined Julian's current learning approach, he described this workflow:\n1. Get big picture understanding through YouTube videos and ChatGPT\n2. Map main connections between concepts\n3. Try to immediately apply knowledge to work problems\n\nThe issue was the jump from step 2 to step 3 was too abrupt. He was trying to apply high-level concepts to specific problems without the necessary intermediate knowledge.\n\n**The solution:** Insert a \"seeking relevance\" phase between mapping connections and application. Spend time deliberately seeking the lowest-hanging conceptual fruit and building out those areas before attempting application.\n\n## The Role of AI in Learning\n\nJulian asked an important question: How should we use AI tools like ChatGPT in our learning process, especially given research suggesting potential cognitive drawbacks?\n\n**My guiding principle: Use AI to save time, but not to save effort.**\n\nThe nuance here is crucial. Learning requires cognitive effort—the struggle to understand, connect, and make sense of information is what builds robust neural connections and lasting expertise.\n\n**When to use AI:**\n- For tedious but cognitively simple tasks (summarizing transcripts, generating keyword lists)\n- As a springboard when you're confident in your ability to evaluate accuracy\n- To save time on processes you could do yourself but would take too long\n\n**When to avoid AI:**\n- For tasks that require deep cognitive engagement\n- When you're building foundational understanding in a new area\n- When you lack the expertise to evaluate AI-generated content critically\n\nFor beginners, I recommend using AI less than you might want to. It's easy to fall into the trap of cognitive offloading—letting AI do the thinking for you—which prevents the development of genuine expertise.\n\n## Key Takeaways for Faster Workplace Learning\n\n1. **Recognize that lack of structure can be an advantage**—it allows you to learn in ways that suit your brain rather than following someone else's curriculum.\n\n2. **Choose your learning approach based on your goals**—problem-based for quick results on predictable challenges, relevance-based for comprehensive expertise.\n\n3. **Develop sensitivity to overwhelm**—when learning feels overwhelming, it's a sign you're trying to absorb information without sufficient connection points. Pivot to simpler, more connectable concepts.\n\n4. **Test your learning constantly**—regularly check whether your knowledge translates to practical application and problem-solving ability.\n\n5. **Use AI as an assistant, not a replacement** for your cognitive processes.\n\nThe most successful learners aren't those who follow perfect systems, but those who develop the metacognitive awareness to recognize when their approach isn't working and the flexibility to adjust accordingly. By building your learning around relevance and connection rather than coverage and completion, you can develop the robust, applicable expertise needed to thrive in today's rapidly changing professional landscape.\n\n*Based on a coaching session with Julian, shared with permission.
