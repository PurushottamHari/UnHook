The company works on bringing back extinct species like the woolly mammoth by sequencing ancient DNA, comparing it with the closest living relatives using AI, and engineering changes into their cells. These edited cells are then implanted into surrogates. The discussion also covers artificial womb technology, which is crucial for scaling de-extinction efforts. Projects include synthetic uterine walls and marsupial-focused systems. The goal is to restore iconic species and use these technologies to help conserve biodiversity amid the current extinction crisis."

      "markdown_string": "**De-Extinction Explained: From Mammoths to Artificial Wombs**\n\n---\n\n### The Mission: Bringing Back Lost Species\n\n“You have a lot of energy,” the interviewer begins, “I mean, for someone who’s probably as stressed as you are, you have a lot of energy.”\n\n“Thank you, that’s very kind,” comes the reply. “Thank you. Please take a moment and explain to people in a bit more detail what you’ve been doing at Colossal for so long?”\n\n“Yeah, the weirdest thing is it feels like we’ve been here for a hundred years, but actually, we’ve only been around for four. We just celebrated our four-year anniversary. We are the world’s first de-extinction and species conservation company.”\n\nThe mission, as laid out, is twofold:\n\n1.  **Bringing back iconic species.**\n2.  **Leveraging and open-sourcing these technologies** to aid conservation and address the biodiversity crisis.\n\n“We are in the sixth mass extinction,” the speaker continues, “where we could lose up to fifty percent of total biodiversity in the next twenty-five years. If we can innovate and create new tools for conservation, and also bring these species back to inspire kids… that’s our mission.”\n\nWhen asked if climate change is the sole driver of this catastrophic loss, the explanation broadens. “It’s a combination of factors, right? It’s habitat destruction. It’s pollution. It’s anthropogenic climate change. It’s really a blend of things. Some insect species are being affected by pesticides and other chemicals. So, it’s all really anthropogenic or human-caused impacts. So, it’s us, trying to figure out how we can live with nature. And it’s about building the industrial and technological future that humanity is crafting. The question is, how do we build it in harmony? Humanity hasn't figured that out yet.”\n\n---\n\n### De-Extinction for a Five-Year-Old\n\n“And you said what you do is de-extinction.”\n“Yes.”\n“Explain de-extinction to me like I’m five years old.”\n\n“Okay. If you’ve seen Jurassic Park—I don’t know if you’re five or your parents gave it to you, but it’s weird—it’s exactly like Jurassic Park. And we get that comparison all the time. People say, 'Oh, it’s just like Jurassic Park,' and for a while, we distanced ourselves from it. But what Jurassic Park did well was explain the basics.”\n\nThe explanation begins with a simple analogy: all living things—humans, animals, plants—are made of letters that form DNA.\n\n“So, for a five-year-old, we all—humans, animals, and plants—are made of these letters that make up DNA. And what we do is we find ancient DNA and build a genome from it. So, what is that combination of letters that makes an ancient species an ancient species? And we do this process for the closest living relatives as well.”\n\nThe process involves a high-tech comparison:\n\n*   **We use AI, computer models, and software** to compare the ancient DNA with the closest living relative to understand all the changes.\n*   **Like in Jurassic Park**, we make those changes in the closest living relative.\n*   Once that’s done, **we get a cell that has the changes that turn, for example, an Asian elephant cell into a mammoth cell.**\n*   **Then we put that into its closest living relative.** In the case of the woolly mammoth, that’s the Asian elephant.\n*   “And then, if everything goes right at the end of that pregnancy, we will actually have a little baby mammoth.”\n\nThe conclusion is as simple as it is staggering: “It’s insanity.”\n“Yes.”\n\n---\n\n### The Game-Changer: Artificial Wombs\n\nThe conversation then pivots to a technology that still feels like science fiction: artificial wombs.\n\n“Oh, and we also have an artificial womb team. Right now, the weirdest thing to me is that de-extinction felt like science fiction just a few years ago. Now, based on what we’ve achieved with the woolly rat and the dirus wolf, and then the direction we’re going, de-extinction doesn’t even feel like science fiction to me anymore. The artificial womb stuff still does. We’re not there yet.”\n\nThe vision for this technology is about scale, not just possibility.\n\n“In an ideal world, if we fast-forward five years, I hope we can grow extinct species in artificial wombs, and think about how to use these for endangered species.” The speaker points to projects like the Northern White Rhino, where only two females remain. “So, if you think about it, every fifteen months, if you are perfectly on the estrus cycle and every implantation is perfect—which doesn't even happen in humans, I doubt it would work in the Northern White Rhino—you limit your number of offspring.”\n\nThe power of artificial wombs, or *ex-utero* development, is parallelization. “If you can serialize and parallelize it—meaning do it all ex-utero—you could produce 1,000 mammoths or 1,000 Northern White Rhinos in a lab.”\n\n**“So for me, the artificial womb is not a necessary path for the work of de-extinction, but it is a very necessary path for the scale of the work we want to do.”**\n\n---\n\n### What Does an Artificial Womb Look Like?\n\n“And, I mean, I can picture a rhino or a mammoth, at least its physical form. Does an artificial womb look like something out of silicone, carbon? I mean, what does it look like?”\n\n“Well, right now, it’s pretty ugly. I mean, I’m just being honest. It’s a little bit gross.”\n\nThe company is pursuing three parallel artificial womb projects, each modeled on a different type of natural reproduction:\n\n1.  **The Artificial Egg Structure:** “We have an artificial… egg structure, which looks a bit like a future egg.” This is being developed for larger bird species, like the Moa. It’s not white, but transparent, with a twist-off top, resembling a “weird jar.” It has a flat top for imaging, allowing it to be screwed directly into a microscope—a significant advantage over natural eggs. The core challenge is engineering a gas-permeable polymer, as real eggs exchange oxygen and gases. “It’s not just like something off the shelf. So we’ve had to solve a lot of hard problems here.”\n\n2.  **The Placental Mammal Path:** This focuses on replicating the uterine wall. “That project is not in the bag stage that you’re probably picturing in your imagination.” Instead, the team is focused on engineering a synthetic uterine wall using hydrogels and microfluidic devices. This wall must handle the exchange of gas, waste, and nutrients, allowing a placenta to attach and interface with it. “The best thing about an embryo is the placenta comes out and biology does it all for us… So we’re building a synthetic uterine wall.”\n\n3.  **The Marsupial Project:** This targets animals like kangaroos, Tasmanian tigers, and koalas. Because their gestation is short and the placenta doesn’t deeply invade the uterine wall, the process can be done in a roller culture and medium. “So we have something we call the Ferris wheel. We have a Ferris wheel system where we can produce and grow these in little vats that are spinning. And it looks like a very scientific, very sci-fi Ferris wheel. Which is, of course, very small.”\n    “Wow.”\n    “Yeah. So those are our three projects.”\n\nA crucial caveat is added: “None of these have, to be clear, produced any results yet. None of these have produced any animals yet. All the work done on the woolly rat and the dirus wolf has been through surrogacy.”\n“Surrogacy.”\n“Yes, yes.”\n\nThese three models mirror nature’s own diverse methods of reproduction: the ex-egg, the placental path, and the marsupial approach. And even within the placental stage, there are variations. “There are four main categories of placenta. It’s not all in one bag like we think… And so there will be variations along that kind of midline.”\n\n“Interesting. Yeah.”\n“And you know I… It’s a good project. It’s a very interesting project, but it’s quite long-term.”\n“Underselling it.”\n“A good project? I think it’s a historic project.”\n## The Unlikely Genesis: From Skepticism to Scientific Breakthrough\n\nThe journey from concept to reality is rarely a straight line, and for Colossal, it began not in a lab, but in a moment of profound personal reflection. The founder describes a period where the idea was \"just completely shadowing my mind.\" It wasn't a fleeting thought, but a persistent, driving force. \"I just felt, you know, I don't know if these were signs or introspection, but I wanted to do something big.\"\n\nThis conviction required a radical pivot. He brought in a CEO to run his previous, highly successful software company, Hypergiant. When the new CEO asked what he was going to do next, the answer was simple: \"I'm going to do something completely different.\"\n\nThe first port of call was his existing network of investors, the very people who had funded his string of successful software ventures. Their reaction was swift and unanimous: \"They said, 'This is crazy.'\" Their advice was to stick to what he knew. \"Just build another software thing. You've built five software companies, just build another software thing.\" But that was precisely what he *didn't* want to do. The mission had to be bigger.\n\nThis rejection forced a strategic retreat and a more profound question: \"Who are the right and appropriate investors who can really stand behind this idea, who have a long-term mindset, who actually care about impact on society? Who also know that if we're successful, the positive impact on society will be felt forever.\"\n\nThe subsequent fundraising pitch was, by his own admission, \"pretty bad.\" It was a testament to sheer vision over tangible assets. The pitch was essentially:\n\n*   We have no deal with Harvard.\n*   We have raised no capital so far. (I'll put some of my own money in).\n*   We have no scientists on our team.\n*   And we have no license to this technology.\n*   And we have no idea if we'll make money. Please give us your money.\n\nIt was a high-stakes gamble, with the thesis resting on one core belief: \"George says we can do this.\" The founder had spent some of his own money to verify the possibility, but the real sell was the potential impact. \"We're pretty confident that if we're successful in this, the world will never be the same again... And if we're successful, the technology alone is worth billions of dollars. Without any monetization, just the technology has value.\"\n\nThis high-level, almost philosophical pitch worked on a combination of reputation and audacity. \"A lot of people knew George. A lot of people knew me.\" The initial round was a mixed bag; about half of the old clients he expected to join immediately did so, while the other half did not. But then, by focusing on \"big, crazy, and bold investors\" willing to take a bet, the tide turned. \"As soon as we started raising capital and started meeting with the people we hoped would help us, we started getting yes after yes after yes.\"\n\nThey initially aimed to raise $8 million. They closed $16 million before the company was even publicly announced. They were at full speed from day one.\n\n## The Dire Wolf: A Case Study in De-Extinction\n\nThe conversation then pivots to a tangible example: the dire wolf. This project perfectly illustrates the multi-faceted challenge of de-extinction. Before Colossal's work, the best genomic coverage anyone had achieved for the dire wolf was about 0.15x coverage, or roughly 15%. Despite the thousands of skulls found in places like the La Brea Tar Pits, the heat and acidity of the tar destroyed any viable DNA.\n\nColossal's approach was different. Leveraging their growing knowledge of canine genetics and cloning, they identified it as an interesting project. Crucially, they engaged with Indigenous communities across America, as the dire wolf was primarily a North American species. The feedback was revealing. Many tribes spoke of a \"great wolf,\" describing it as large, white, and shaggy, with a rich mythology surrounding it separate from modern pop culture depictions. \"Many of their people believed that it was the dire wolf,\" the founder notes.\n\nThe scientific breakthrough came from sampling strategy. Instead of teeth, which yielded minimal data, they sampled the petrous bone—a dense part of the inner skull. Using proprietary methods and newly developed techniques, they extracted 500 times more data than anyone else, achieving around 13 reads for the full genome of two dire wolves separated by 60,000 years of genetic variation.\n\nThis was a goldmine. It allowed them to identify which genes truly made a dire wolf a dire wolf. The 60,000 years of variation between their two samples was far greater than the 12,500 years between the most recent sample and today, giving them a clear picture of stable, defining traits. They then performed comparative genomics and integrated these key genes into a gray wolf platform.\n\n**The \"Hybrid\" Question and the Nature of Species**\n\nThis leads to the inevitable and complex question: Is this a true dire wolf or a hybrid?\n\nThe answer delves into the messy reality of biology. \"Technically, we all, like you and I, fall into what's called 'admixture',\" he explains. True hybrids, in a strict scientific sense, are the F1 generation of two different species. Every generation after that is admixture.\n\n\"If we could just clone, my life would be so much easier, right?\" he says. But with no living cells, cloning is impossible. \"Think of it like rebuilding extinct species for today.\" So, the dire wolf was rebuilt based on the core phenotypes it had lost over time, engineered into a closely related gray wolf. Genetically, they are about 99.8% identical.\n\nThe debate over whether this new animal is a dire wolf, a hybrid, or something else entirely is, he argues, a human imposition on nature. \"The whole concept of taxonomy, classification, and hybridization, these are all human constructs because we humans like to put things in buckets. That's how we think.\"\n\nHe uses the polar bear and brown bear as an analogy. By one common species definition—the ability to produce viable offspring—they are the same species, as they interbreed freely. \"But if you look at them, they're not the same.\" A child shown pictures of both would instantly recognize they are different animals. \"So many of the ways we define species don't agree with each other, which is just, it's ridiculously silly.\"\n\nColossal's perspective is that they have created a \"reconstituted extinct species.\" It's not something entirely new, as it's built on the gray wolf's evolutionary foundation, but it is equipped with the core genes that drove the iconic dire wolf phenotypes. It is, in essence, a functional equivalent.\n\n## The Expanding Portfolio: From Mammoths to Giant Moa\n\nBeyond the dire wolf, Colossal's ambitious portfolio includes the Woolly Mammoth, the Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger), and the Dodo. A recent, exciting addition is a project with the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre in New Zealand and filmmaker Peter Jackson to de-extinct the South Island Giant Moa.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the Moa was a \"13-foot-tall bird,\" at least the South Island Giant Moa was. It was flightless, or \"flight-incapable,\" and went extinct about 600 years ago due to hunting by the Māori people. The founder struggles to find the words to describe it. \"Think of a large ostrich... but it has no wings.\" It was covered in hair-like feathers, even on its neck, and was a truly bizarre-looking creature.\n\n\"It's probably the closest thing to a dinosaur bird that humans lived alongside,\" he says, highlighting its unique place in natural history. It, along with the Thylacine, Dodo, Woolly Mammoth, and Dire Wolf, form the core of Colossal's public mission.\n\nAnd then there are the woolly rats. \"Technically I think we have to include this because I don't want to make anyone mad. We made woolly rats, but that was a test.\" This was the company's Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It was with the woolly rat that they practically demonstrated their end-to-end screening process for gene edits works, engineering the mammoth-hair equivalent phenotypes into a mouse. It was the crucial, functioning prototype that proved the larger dream was achievable.\n\nThis foundational work on multiple species, from the tiny rat to the giant moa, sets the stage for the next great technological hurdle: the artificial womb systems required to bring these engineered genomes to life, a challenge as monumental as the genetic engineering itself.\n## The Woolly Rat MVP & The Limits of Time\n\nThe woolly rat project wasn't just another species on the docket; it was a critical proof-of-concept, a biological MVP designed to validate the entire genetic pipeline. The challenge wasn't merely editing a genome, but doing so with precision and a deep consideration for animal welfare.\n\n\"You can't just put weird things into weird things, right?\" the founder noted, highlighting the ethical and practical necessity of their computational approach. They meticulously analyzed which genes in the rat had direct counterparts in its extinct relative, ensuring the edits were not just possible, but *right*. These genes were then engineered into a multiplex editing array—a sophisticated, multi-target genetic tool. The result was staggering: **36 successfully born woolly rats in a single month.**\n\n\"It was a one-month project, which is kind of insane,\" he admitted. This rapid success was a clear signal. The woolly rat was more than a test; it was a tangible, living benchmark proving they were on the correct trajectory for the far more complex woolly mammoth. It demonstrated that their process could move from digital analysis to living, breathing reality at a breathtaking pace.\n\n## The Dinosaur Question & The Hard Stop of Deep Time\n\nInevitably, the conversation turns to the one extinct group that captures the universal imagination: dinosaurs. \"Believe it or not, we get the dinosaur question all the time,\" the founder said with a knowing laugh. \"Why?\"\n\nThe answer lies in the unforgiving nature of deep time. The oldest DNA Colossal works with is approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million years old, from a steppe mammoth. The idea of finding viable dinosaur DNA, however, is a different matter entirely.\n\n\"I don't like to use the word 'impossible',\" he clarified. \"I think it's very *unlikely* that we'll ever get dino DNA.\" The extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago places them far beyond the current horizon of genetic recovery. He debunked the popular \"amber\" theory, explaining that amber, found in warm, humid environments, is actually a terrible preserver of DNA. It's porous, allowing microorganisms to infiltrate and degrade the genetic material over millions of years.\n\n\"So I don't think we'll ever get true dino DNA, even though you see the occasional clickbait article on Instagram, right? And I fall for them, too. I click on them every time.\"\n\nThis established a fascinating boundary for de-extinction. The field isn't a magical portal to any point in the past, but a scientific discipline constrained by the half-life of DNA itself. The practical window, for now, seems to extend back about 1 to 2 million years into the Early Pleistocene epoch.\n\n## A Pleistocene Menagerie of Possibilities\n\nWhile dinosaurs are off the table, the Pleistocene offers a spectacular array of candidates. This period was a \"golden age\" for de-extinction, filled with megafauna that could fundamentally reshape ecosystems.\n\nThe founder's eyes lit up as he listed them: \"There were woolly rhinos. There was the giant ground sloth. There was a thing called a glyptodon, which is... think of an armadillo the size of a Volkswagen Beetle.\" He described a \"giant beaver\" that stood nearly six feet tall. \"Which is either the dumbest or the scariest thing. It's not clear.\"\n\nThis period is a treasure trove of biological diversity waiting to be explored, a testament to the fact that even with a two-million-year limit, the potential for restoration is immense. He even touched upon the Titanoboa, a colossal, super-anaconda-like creature from five or six million years ago. \"We would never bring that back, even if we had its DNA.\" Some lines, it seems, are drawn not just by science, but by primal common sense. \"Anaconda as a film or a series is way scarier than Jurassic Park... like, snakes playing in that would be even more terrifying.\"\n\n## The Near Future: An Ark of Artificial Wombs\n\nLooking forward, the founder outlined a vision that feels both science-fictional and imminent. \"The thing that will blow people's minds,\" he began, \"is that there will be a time when you walk into a lab and every endangered species is there. It'll be almost like Noah's Ark.\" Alongside them, extinct species would be developing in artificial wombs.\n\nWhen asked for a timeline, he was confident: \"A decade.\" To an outsider, a decade might seem distant, but from his perspective, immersed in the accelerating timeline of their work, \"a decade feels like tomorrow.\" This is the tangible, near-term future of conservation: a biobank where species are no longer lost, but paused, awaiting the right conditions for their return.\n\nHe also highlighted lesser-known animals, like the Steller's sea cow, a manatee or dugong the size of a whale. \"It's very large, but very docile. Everyone in the world loves that animal; it's hard to hate it.\" Driven to extinction by humans within just 30-50 years of its discovery, its return would be a powerful act of restorative justice, once the artificial womb technology for such a large marine mammal is perfected.\n\n## The Larger Vision: Synthesizing Biology and Habitat\n\nBeyond de-extinction itself lies a grander, more integrated future. The founder and his co-founder often speculate on the convergence of synthetic biology, AI, and eventually quantum computing. This isn't just about bringing back the past; it's about engineering a new, symbiotic relationship with nature.\n\nHe posed a series of provocative, visionary questions: \"What if we started a plants company and engineered a tree to grow like a tree house? Could you engineer a tree to have built-in bioluminescence from fungi for lighting? Could you create a structure you could live in?\"\n\nThis \"weird\" idea points to a future where technology doesn't stand against nature, but integrates with it. Imagine \"skyscraper trees\" that grow only as tall as they need for photosynthesis, creating dense, vertical forests. Or \"sentinel\" plants engineered to react to environmental pressures or chemical signals. Imagine natural barriers—forests of trees with the strength of titanium—acting as impassable walls between conflicting nations. \"No one's driving a tank through that, right? It's insanity.\"\n\nIn this expansive view, de-extinction is merely the starting point, the \"merch\" that draws people in. \"What's inside is so much bigger,\" he explained. \"People don't fully grasp it, but that's okay. Even if they just get to the tip of the iceberg...\"\n\n## The Unintended Audience: Inspiring the Next Generation\n\nA fascinating and unexpected pattern has emerged: their most passionate and informed audience is children. Despite not actively targeting youth programming, their message has resonated powerfully with the next generation.\n\n\"I was at a conference last week where three or four people said, 'My kid was telling me about this,'\" he shared. This grassroots, bottom-up excitement is precisely what they hope for. \"We want to inspire the next generation.\"\n\nThis phenomenon was crystallized in a remarkable story from the Maldives. The founder, on vacation with his wife, overheard a mother and child arguing about a sound in the trees. The mother insisted it was a dodo. The child, no more than a few years old, corrected her: \"That's not a dodo. The dodo is our thing.\" A debate ensued, with the child insisting, \"They are extinct. But there is actually a company working to bring the dodo back.\"\n\n\"This is a kid. We're talking about a tiny little island in the Maldives,\" the founder recalled, still amazed. He turned and informed the mother that her son was correct, revealing he worked for the very company the child was referencing. The child, it turned out, recognized the Colossal logo on his shirt. \"For me, that was a mind-blowing moment... We've sparked that curiosity. And I think we need that now more than ever.\"\n\nThis \"halo effect\" is perhaps the most significant, if unquantifiable, impact of their work. \"If bringing back a mammoth inspires 20 kids who go on to cure cancer, I don't think we can measure that.\"\n\n## A Techno-Optimist's Horizon\n\nThe conversation culminated in a sweeping vision of the next 30 years, a future where the convergence of biology and technology solves humanity's greatest challenges.\n\n\"If you fast-forward the clock 30 years, I think we will have cured all major diseases,\" he stated. He envisions an average life expectancy of 200 years or more, with a healthspan—the period of life spent in good health—reaching 150 to 180 years. \"I truly believe 150 is the new 40,\" he said, only half-joking.\n\nHe pointed to existing progress: cancer vaccines in development, solutions for diabetes and obesity on the horizon, and drugs that can lower LDL cholesterol to newborn-like levels. \"There are things today that we have actually solved.\"\n\nAugmented by AI and computational power, he believes cellular reprogramming and epigenetic reversal will become routine, making healthcare unrecognizable from today's model.\n\nFurthermore, he envisions a world where de-extinction and \"geo-engineering\" merge. Through biobanking and AI-driven adaptation, we could not only produce endangered or extinct species but also actively tune and adapt their ecosystems, reintroducing them to a world made ready for them once more.\n\nIn this future, the lines between conservation, creation, and integration blur, pointing toward a world where humanity doesn't just stop its destructive impact but begins to actively, intelligently, and symbiotically co-author the natural world.\n\nThis sets the stage for the final, crucial frontier: the ethical landscape and the global conversation that will ultimately determine the boundaries of this new power.\n## The Ethical Frontier: Navigating the Uncharted Territory of De-Extinction\n\nAs the conversation pivots from technological possibility to practical application, the dialogue naturally arrives at the most complex frontier: the ethical landscape. The speaker acknowledges this transition with a thoughtful pause, recognizing that creating capability doesn’t automatically confer permission.\n\n**\"So, can we create new species? Yes. Should we? That’s where it gets complicated.\"**\n\nThis simple dichotomy opens into a nuanced exploration of responsibility versus capability. The speaker draws a crucial distinction between what’s scientifically possible and what’s ethically advisable, using vivid examples to illustrate the spectrum:\n\n*   **The \"Game of Thrones\" scenario:** Creating fantastical creatures for spectacle\n*   **The dire wolf challenge:** Reconstructing precise historical species with high accuracy\n*   **The woolly mammoth mission:** Achieving ecological restoration through careful genetic engineering\n\n\"What people sometimes miss,\" the speaker notes, \"is that we’re actually purists in our approach. We’re trying to work in a targeted way while balancing animal welfare, editing things we know, taking as little risk as possible. But what’s important—and what sometimes gets lost—is that there’s a high level of precision here.\"\n\n### The Precision Principle and Its Limits\n\nThe conversation delves into what separates responsible de-extinction from genetic experimentation. The speaker offers a compelling test case: \"We generally know what a thylacine looked like. If I brought you a thylacine that was rabbit-sized and pink, you’d say, ‘That doesn’t look like a thylacine.’ So the point is... we can’t just engineer any trait randomly.\"\n\nThis precision principle becomes the ethical bedrock—the understanding that reconstruction requires fidelity to historical and ecological truth, not creative license. Yet the speaker acknowledges that as knowledge expands, so does possibility: \"Over time, I think we humans—and especially Colossal—will know so much about coat color, size, and all these variations that you could basically engineer a new species. Now, what would be the purpose?\"\n\n### From Spectacle to Solution: The Shift Toward Ecological Utility\n\nThe dialogue takes an unexpected turn toward practical applications that transcend mere curiosity or entertainment. The speaker becomes animated discussing microorganisms that consume waste metals to create gold nanoparticles, or enzymes that break down plastic. \"I thought, can we supercharge this and just make an alchemy machine? That’s crazy.\"\n\nThis sparks a broader vision of biological solutions to environmental crises:\n\n*   **Nuclear waste-consuming organisms**\n*   **Genetically modified corals** resistant to warming and salinity changes\n*   **Rapid-reproducing algae** for sustainable food production\n\nThe food production concept particularly captures the imagination: \"Imagine if you had some base organism, like algae, that you could process to double at an insane rate. You’d have almost endless supply because you just give it oxygen and sunlight. So you could have these systems in your home and then you could actually 3D print, like a burger, a patty, that’s obviously made from this.\"\n\nThe speaker reflects on the cultural shift this would represent: \"If you ever do that, or if humanity ever does that, we’ll look back at the times when we were hunting, killing, and butchering animals for food. It will seem historically quite barbaric.\"\n\n### The Business of Conservation: New Economic Models for Restoration\n\nAs the conversation moves from ecological benefits to economic sustainability, the speaker outlines a sophisticated multi-layered approach that transcends simple zoo models or entertainment value:\n\n**1. Technological Spin-outs**\n*   Computational biology platforms for pharmaceutical rediscovery\n*   Plastic degradation companies\n*   Specialized applications of core technologies\n\n**2. The Platform Itself**\n*   End-to-end synthetic biology infrastructure\n*   Applications ranging from drought-resistant livestock to specialized crops\n*   \"I really think this end-to-end synthetic biology platform we’re building will be quite valuable over time for the various products that come out of it.\"\n\n**3. Conservation Economics**\n*   Ecotourism and rewilding models\n*   Carbon and biodiversity credits evolving into \"nature credits\"\n*   Government partnerships and subsidies for species preservation\n\nThe speaker reveals an emerging trend: \"Countries are coming to us saying, ‘We’re spending hundreds of millions on these conservation projects, but we’re not making progress. We’re not building sufficient genetic diversity. We’re seeing genetic bottlenecks. We don’t know how to mass-produce these.’\"\n\n### The Ultimate Test: Mammoths as Moral Commitment\n\nPerhaps the most revealing moment comes when addressing whether Colossal would be considered successful if it solved numerous environmental problems and spawned multiple billion-dollar companies—but never brought back the woolly mammoth.\n\n**\"That’s failure.\"**\n\nThe response is immediate and unequivocal. \"The woolly mammoth—that’s the thing everything hangs on. That’s my personal opinion... When you make a big promise, you should put all your strength behind delivering it.\"\n\nThis commitment reveals the deeper philosophy: de-extinction isn’t merely a marketing vehicle for broader biotechnology applications. It represents a moral commitment to restoration, to inspiring future generations, and to demonstrating that human technological advancement can serve ecological healing rather than just exploitation.\n\n\"The inspiration effect on the next generation when they hear these animals went extinct 10,000 years ago—that’s an unmeasurable impact. And having sustainable herds back in the ecosystem, contributing to positive ecosystem impact...\"\n\nThe conversation has now firmly established that the technological achievements, while impressive, represent only one dimension of the de-extinction story. The ethical considerations, economic models, and philosophical commitments form an equally complex landscape that will determine whether these technologies heal or harm.\n\nAs we approach the final section, the stage is set for examining the global conversation around these technologies—how different cultures, governments, and communities are responding to the possibility of species restoration, and what frameworks might guide humanity through this unprecedented ethical territory.\n## The Uncharted Territory: From Mammoths to the Nature of Life Itself\n\nThe conversation takes a sharp turn into the profound and the personal. The speaker pivots from the grand, species-level promise of the mammoth to a more intimate, human-scale responsibility: the promise made to a child.\n\n> \"I don't care about some Reddit troll at all, okay?... But what really matters to me is if there's a 10-year-old kid who has hope for us... if we don't deliver on that, I feel like I've let those kids down.\"\n\nThis isn't just about scientific progress; it's about the renewal of cosmic-scale hope. The project's success becomes a moral litmus test for humanity's ability to keep its word to the next generation, transforming a biotech venture into a covenant with the future.\n\n### The Human Question: De-Extinction's Forbidden Frontier\n\nInevitably, this leads to the elephant in the room—or rather, the human. The speaker poses the provocative, almost satirical question: **Could this technology be used to bring back the dead?**\n\nThe response is immediate and draws a stark ethical line. Colossal, the speaker asserts, has a clear, non-negotiable policy: **no work on humans or even non-human primates.** The reasoning is multifaceted:\n\n*   **Governance and Misinformation:** Any technology with human applications is licensed out to exist under a separate governance structure. \"People already have weird conspiracies about us. The last thing I want is for people to say... and then Colossal comes out with a cure for baldness. And people go, 'Wait a minute, is that mammoth hair?'\"\n*   **The \"Could\" vs. \"Should\" Chasm:** The speaker acknowledges the theoretical possibility. With a preserved DNA sample, one could create a genetic replica of an Albert Einstein or a LeBron James. But they emphatically state that this would not be a resurrection of the person.\n    *   **The Clone is Not the Original:** Using the analogy of cloned pets, they note that while genetically identical, the clone's behavior and personality are not a perfect copy. The clone would be a new individual, a twin separated by time.\n    *   **The Mystery of Experience:** \"I'm a firm believer that we are far more than the sum of our parts.\" You could not, they argue, bring back Albert Einstein's *soul* or the unique confluence of environment and experience that forged his genius. You would have a human with Einstein's cognitive potential, but not his consciousness.\n\nThis segues into a startling, almost sci-fi reality check about artificial wombs. The speaker notes that developing an artificial womb for an elephant—a monumental technical challenge they are undertaking—is actually *harder* than developing one for a human.\n\n> \"If we solve it for elephants, it will be easier for humans. I'm not saying you should do it. But there may be a time when people look back... and people might say, you know, there was a time when humans grew humans inside of humans. That's weird.\"\n\nThis highlights the one-way nature of technological progress. Once a capability is demonstrated, the ethical and social landscape around it can shift dramatically.\n\n### Fears, Critics, and the Weight of Power\n\nWhen asked about his personal fears and the strongest criticisms of his work, the speaker's concerns are not about online trolls but about the raw power of the technology itself.\n\nHis greatest fear is the potential for misuse, drawing a direct parallel to the COVID-19 pandemic. He expresses a belief that synthetic biology and genome engineering are \"truly and unequivocally the most valuable and most powerful technology in the world,\" possessing more power for good—and for catastrophic harm—than even nuclear weapons. The proliferation of these technologies is irreversible; the cat is out of the bag.\n\nAs for critics, he addresses three common arguments:\n\n1.  **\"You're taking money from conservation.\"** He dismisses this as uninformed, countering that all their developed technologies are open-sourced for conservation, that they are bringing *new* money to the field, and that they have raised a separate $50 million foundation dedicated solely to conservation.\n2.  **\"You're playing God.\"** His response is pragmatic and pointed: \"We play God every day when we overfish the oceans or drive a species to extinction, right?\" He frames their work not as hubris, but as a responsibility to use human intelligence and technology to correct past mistakes.\n3.  **The \"Purity\" Debate:** A small but vocal group of critics fixate on semantics—whether the resulting animal is a \"true\" mammoth. His response is both firm and flippant: call it a \"cold-tolerant elephant with mammoth-engineered alleles\" if you wish, but he won't be dictated to on nomenclature.\n\n### The Final Frontier: DNA, Mystery, and the Nature of Life\n\nThe conversation concludes on a deeply philosophical note, exploring how this work changes one's perspective on creation, nature, and life itself.\n\nFor the speaker, DNA is not just a chemical blueprint; it's \"magical.\" He describes an almost spiritual quality to the process of genetic engineering:\n\n> \"Life finds a way... It heals itself. It wants—it wants to work. Whatever anyone says—and probably many of my scientists would disagree with this—there is a purposiveness to it.\"\n\nThis isn't a rejection of science, but an acknowledgment of its limits. He believes in God and sees a \"purposiveness\" woven into the fabric of reality, from the mathematical language of astrophysics to the resilient, self-organizing nature of DNA. He's comfortable with mystery.\n\n> \"I'm fine with not knowing everything. And I think that's where a lot of times people make the biggest mistakes, right?... We humans sometimes get very... egotistical and arrogant. And we say, no, but we've solved it. We have the answer. And, you know, I've always been a little bit more open-minded, actually. I think we don't know as much as we think we know.\"\n\n### Conclusion: A Journey of Responsibility and Wonder\n\nThis final leg of the journey reveals that de-extinction is far more than a technical checklist. It is a project layered with profound ethical commitments—to a child's hope, to ecological restoration, and to wielding unprecedented power with humility.\n\nIt forces a re-examination of the most fundamental questions: What is life? What is our responsibility to it? And where does human ingenuity end and the inherent, mysterious \"purposiveness\" of nature begin?\n\nThe work at Colossal stands at the precipice of a new era, not just of biotechnology, but of human self-conception. It demands that we proceed with both the boldness of pioneers and the reverence of those who understand that some mysteries are not meant to be solved, only respected. The promise of a mammoth walking the tundra again is not just a symbol of what we can reclaim, but a test of who we will become in the process.",
      "string": "**De-Extinction Explained: From Mammoths to Artificial Wombs**\n\n---\n\n### The Mission: Bringing Back Lost Species\n\n“You have a lot of energy,” the interviewer begins, “I mean, for someone who’s probably as stressed as you are, you have a lot of energy.”\n\n“Thank you, that’s very kind,” comes the reply. “Thank you. Please take a moment and explain to people in a bit more detail what you’ve been doing at Colossal for so long?”\n\n“Yeah, the weirdest thing is it feels like we’ve been here for a hundred years, but actually, we’ve only been around for four. We just celebrated our four-year anniversary. We are the world’s first de-extinction and species conservation company.”\n\nThe mission, as laid out, is twofold:\n\n1.  **Bringing back iconic species.**\n2.  **Leveraging and open-sourcing these technologies** to aid conservation and address the biodiversity crisis.\n\n“We are in the sixth mass extinction,” the speaker continues, “where we could lose up to fifty percent of total biodiversity in the next twenty-five years. If we can innovate and create new tools for conservation, and also bring these species back to inspire kids… that’s our mission.”\n\nWhen asked if climate change is the sole driver of this catastrophic loss, the explanation broadens. “It’s a combination of factors, right? It’s habitat destruction. It’s pollution. It’s anthropogenic climate change. It’s really a blend of things. Some insect species are being affected by pesticides and other chemicals. So, it’s all really anthropogenic or human-caused impacts. So, it’s us, trying to figure out how we can live with nature. And it’s about building the industrial and technological future that humanity is crafting. The question is, how do we build it in harmony? Humanity hasn't figured that out yet.”\n\n---\n\n### De-Extinction for a Five-Year-Old\n\n“And you said what you do is de-extinction.”\n“Yes.”\n“Explain de-extinction to me like I’m five years old.”\n\n“Okay. If you’ve seen Jurassic Park—I don’t know if you’re five or your parents gave it to you, but it’s weird—it’s exactly like Jurassic Park. And we get that comparison all the time. People say, 'Oh, it’s just like Jurassic Park,' and for a while, we distanced ourselves from it. But what Jurassic Park did well was explain the basics.”\n\nThe explanation begins with a simple analogy: all living things—humans, animals, plants—are made of letters that form DNA.\n\n“So, for a five-year-old, we all—humans, animals, and plants—are made of these letters that make up DNA. And what we do is we find ancient DNA and build a genome from it. So, what is that combination of letters that makes an ancient species an ancient species? And we do this process for the closest living relatives as well.”\n\nThe process involves a high-tech comparison:\n\n*   **We use AI, computer models, and software** to compare the ancient DNA with the closest living relative to understand all the changes.\n*   **Like in Jurassic Park**, we make those changes in the closest living relative.\n*   Once that’s done, **we get a cell that has the changes that turn, for example, an Asian elephant cell into a mammoth cell.**\n*   **Then we put that into its closest living relative.** In the case of the woolly mammoth, that’s the Asian elephant.\n*   “And then, if everything goes right at the end of that pregnancy, we will actually have a little baby mammoth.”\n\nThe conclusion is as simple as it is staggering: “It’s insanity.”\n“Yes.”\n\n---\n\n### The Game-Changer: Artificial Wombs\n\nThe conversation then pivots to a technology that still feels like science fiction: artificial wombs.\n\n“Oh, and we also have an artificial womb team. Right now, the weirdest thing to me is that de-extinction felt like science fiction just a few years ago. Now, based on what we’ve achieved with the woolly rat and the dirus wolf, and then the direction we’re going, de-extinction doesn’t even feel like science fiction to me anymore. The artificial womb stuff still does. We’re not there yet.”\n\nThe vision for this technology is about scale, not just possibility.\n\n“In an ideal world, if we fast-forward five years, I hope we can grow extinct species in artificial wombs, and think about how to use these for endangered species.” The speaker points to projects like the Northern White Rhino, where only two females remain. “So, if you think about it, every fifteen months, if you are perfectly on the estrus cycle and every implantation is perfect—which doesn't even happen in humans, I doubt it would work in the Northern White Rhino—you limit your number of offspring.”\n\nThe power of artificial wombs, or *ex-utero* development, is parallelization. “If you can serialize and parallelize it—meaning do it all ex-utero—you could produce 1,000 mammoths or 1,000 Northern White Rhinos in a lab.”\n\n**“So for me, the artificial womb is not a necessary path for the work of de-extinction, but it is a very necessary path for the scale of the work we want to do.”**\n\n---\n\n### What Does an Artificial Womb Look Like?\n\n“And, I mean, I can picture a rhino or a mammoth, at least its physical form. Does an artificial womb look like something out of silicone, carbon? I mean, what does it look like?”\n\n“Well, right now, it’s pretty ugly. I mean, I’m just being honest. It’s a little bit gross.”\n\nThe company is pursuing three parallel artificial womb projects, each modeled on a different type of natural reproduction:\n\n1.  **The Artificial Egg Structure:** “We have an artificial… egg structure, which looks a bit like a future egg.” This is being developed for larger bird species, like the Moa. It’s not white, but transparent, with a twist-off top, resembling a “weird jar.” It has a flat top for imaging, allowing it to be screwed directly into a microscope—a significant advantage over natural eggs. The core challenge is engineering a gas-permeable polymer, as real eggs exchange oxygen and gases. “It’s not just like something off the shelf. So we’ve had to solve a lot of hard problems here.”\n\n2.  **The Placental Mammal Path:** This focuses on replicating the uterine wall. “That project is not in the bag stage that you’re probably picturing in your imagination.” Instead, the team is focused on engineering a synthetic uterine wall using hydrogels and microfluidic devices. This wall must handle the exchange of gas, waste, and nutrients, allowing a placenta to attach and interface with it. “The best thing about an embryo is the placenta comes out and biology does it all for us… So we’re building a synthetic uterine wall.”\n\n3.  **The Marsupial Project:** This targets animals like kangaroos, Tasmanian tigers, and koalas. Because their gestation is short and the placenta doesn’t deeply invade the uterine wall, the process can be done in a roller culture and medium. “So we have something we call the Ferris wheel. We have a Ferris wheel system where we can produce and grow these in little vats that are spinning. And it looks like a very scientific, very sci-fi Ferris wheel. Which is, of course, very small.”\n    “Wow.”\n    “Yeah. So those are our three projects.”\n\nA crucial caveat is added: “None of these have, to be clear, produced any results yet. None of these have produced any animals yet. All the work done on the woolly rat and the dirus wolf has been through surrogacy.”\n“Surrogacy.”\n“Yes, yes.”\n\nThese three models mirror nature’s own diverse methods of reproduction: the ex-egg, the placental path, and the marsupial approach. And even within the placental stage, there are variations. “There are four main categories of placenta. It’s not all in one bag like we think… And so there will be variations along that kind of midline.”\n\n“Interesting. Yeah.”\n“And you know I… It’s a good project. It’s a very interesting project, but it’s quite long-term.”\n“Underselling it.”\n“A good project? I think it’s a historic project.”\n## The Unlikely Genesis: From Skepticism to Scientific Breakthrough\n\nThe journey from concept to reality is rarely a straight line, and for Colossal, it began not in a lab, but in a moment of profound personal reflection. The founder describes a period where the idea was \"just completely shadowing my mind.\" It wasn't a fleeting thought, but a persistent, driving force. \"I just felt, you know, I don't know if these were signs or introspection, but I wanted to do something big.\"\n\nThis conviction required a radical pivot. He brought in a CEO to run his previous, highly successful software company, Hypergiant. When the new CEO asked what he was going to do next, the answer was simple: \"I'm going to do something completely different.\"\n\nThe first port of call was his existing network of investors, the very people who had funded his string of successful software ventures. Their reaction was swift and unanimous: \"They said, 'This is crazy.'\" Their advice was to stick to what he knew. \"Just build another software thing. You've built five software companies, just build another software thing.\" But that was precisely what he *didn't* want to do. The mission had to be bigger.\n\nThis rejection forced a strategic retreat and a more profound question: \"Who are the right and appropriate investors who can really stand behind this idea, who have a long-term mindset, who actually care about impact on society? Who also know that if we're successful, the positive impact on society will be felt forever.\"\n\nThe subsequent fundraising pitch was, by his own admission, \"pretty bad.\" It was a testament to sheer vision over tangible assets. The pitch was essentially:\n\n*   We have no deal with Harvard.\n*   We have raised no capital so far. (I'll put some of my own money in).\n*   We have no scientists on our team.\n*   And we have no license to this technology.\n*   And we have no idea if we'll make money. Please give us your money.\n\nIt was a high-stakes gamble, with the thesis resting on one core belief: \"George says we can do this.\" The founder had spent some of his own money to verify the possibility, but the real sell was the potential impact. \"We're pretty confident that if we're successful in this, the world will never be the same again... And if we're successful, the technology alone is worth billions of dollars. Without any monetization, just the technology has value.\"\n\nThis high-level, almost philosophical pitch worked on a combination of reputation and audacity. \"A lot of people knew George. A lot of people knew me.\" The initial round was a mixed bag; about half of the old clients he expected to join immediately did so, while the other half did not. But then, by focusing on \"big, crazy, and bold investors\" willing to take a bet, the tide turned. \"As soon as we started raising capital and started meeting with the people we hoped would help us, we started getting yes after yes after yes.\"\n\nThey initially aimed to raise $8 million. They closed $16 million before the company was even publicly announced. They were at full speed from day one.\n\n## The Dire Wolf: A Case Study in De-Extinction\n\nThe conversation then pivots to a tangible example: the dire wolf. This project perfectly illustrates the multi-faceted challenge of de-extinction. Before Colossal's work, the best genomic coverage anyone had achieved for the dire wolf was about 0.15x coverage, or roughly 15%. Despite the thousands of skulls found in places like the La Brea Tar Pits, the heat and acidity of the tar destroyed any viable DNA.\n\nColossal's approach was different. Leveraging their growing knowledge of canine genetics and cloning, they identified it as an interesting project. Crucially, they engaged with Indigenous communities across America, as the dire wolf was primarily a North American species. The feedback was revealing. Many tribes spoke of a \"great wolf,\" describing it as large, white, and shaggy, with a rich mythology surrounding it separate from modern pop culture depictions. \"Many of their people believed that it was the dire wolf,\" the founder notes.\n\nThe scientific breakthrough came from sampling strategy. Instead of teeth, which yielded minimal data, they sampled the petrous bone—a dense part of the inner skull. Using proprietary methods and newly developed techniques, they extracted 500 times more data than anyone else, achieving around 13 reads for the full genome of two dire wolves separated by 60,000 years of genetic variation.\n\nThis was a goldmine. It allowed them to identify which genes truly made a dire wolf a dire wolf. The 60,000 years of variation between their two samples was far greater than the 12,500 years between the most recent sample and today, giving them a clear picture of stable, defining traits. They then performed comparative genomics and integrated these key genes into a gray wolf platform.\n\n**The \"Hybrid\" Question and the Nature of Species**\n\nThis leads to the inevitable and complex question: Is this a true dire wolf or a hybrid?\n\nThe answer delves into the messy reality of biology. \"Technically, we all, like you and I, fall into what's called 'admixture',\" he explains. True hybrids, in a strict scientific sense, are the F1 generation of two different species. Every generation after that is admixture.\n\n\"If we could just clone, my life would be so much easier, right?\" he says. But with no living cells, cloning is impossible. \"Think of it like rebuilding extinct species for today.\" So, the dire wolf was rebuilt based on the core phenotypes it had lost over time, engineered into a closely related gray wolf. Genetically, they are about 99.8% identical.\n\nThe debate over whether this new animal is a dire wolf, a hybrid, or something else entirely is, he argues, a human imposition on nature. \"The whole concept of taxonomy, classification, and hybridization, these are all human constructs because we humans like to put things in buckets. That's how we think.\"\n\nHe uses the polar bear and brown bear as an analogy. By one common species definition—the ability to produce viable offspring—they are the same species, as they interbreed freely. \"But if you look at them, they're not the same.\" A child shown pictures of both would instantly recognize they are different animals. \"So many of the ways we define species don't agree with each other, which is just, it's ridiculously silly.\"\n\nColossal's perspective is that they have created a \"reconstituted extinct species.\" It's not something entirely new, as it's built on the gray wolf's evolutionary foundation, but it is equipped with the core genes that drove the iconic dire wolf phenotypes. It is, in essence, a functional equivalent.\n\n## The Expanding Portfolio: From Mammoths to Giant Moa\n\nBeyond the dire wolf, Colossal's ambitious portfolio includes the Woolly Mammoth, the Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger), and the Dodo. A recent, exciting addition is a project with the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre in New Zealand and filmmaker Peter Jackson to de-extinct the South Island Giant Moa.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the Moa was a \"13-foot-tall bird,\" at least the South Island Giant Moa was. It was flightless, or \"flight-incapable,\" and went extinct about 600 years ago due to hunting by the Māori people. The founder struggles to find the words to describe it. \"Think of a large ostrich... but it has no wings.\" It was covered in hair-like feathers, even on its neck, and was a truly bizarre-looking creature.\n\n\"It's probably the closest thing to a dinosaur bird that humans lived alongside,\" he says, highlighting its unique place in natural history. It, along with the Thylacine, Dodo, Woolly Mammoth, and Dire Wolf, form the core of Colossal's public mission.\n\nAnd then there are the woolly rats. \"Technically I think we have to include this because I don't want to make anyone mad. We made woolly rats, but that was a test.\" This was the company's Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It was with the woolly rat that they practically demonstrated their end-to-end screening process for gene edits works, engineering the mammoth-hair equivalent phenotypes into a mouse. It was the crucial, functioning prototype that proved the larger dream was achievable.\n\nThis foundational work on multiple species, from the tiny rat to the giant moa, sets the stage for the next great technological hurdle: the artificial womb systems required to bring these engineered genomes to life, a challenge as monumental as the genetic engineering itself.\n## The Woolly Rat MVP & The Limits of Time\n\nThe woolly rat project wasn't just another species on the docket; it was a critical proof-of-concept, a biological MVP designed to validate the entire genetic pipeline. The challenge wasn't merely editing a genome, but doing so with precision and a deep consideration for animal welfare.\n\n\"You can't just put weird things into weird things, right?\" the founder noted, highlighting the ethical and practical necessity of their computational approach. They meticulously analyzed which genes in the rat had direct counterparts in its extinct relative, ensuring the edits were not just possible, but *right*. These genes were then engineered into a multiplex editing array—a sophisticated, multi-target genetic tool. The result was staggering: **36 successfully born woolly rats in a single month.**\n\n\"It was a one-month project, which is kind of insane,\" he admitted. This rapid success was a clear signal. The woolly rat was more than a test; it was a tangible, living benchmark proving they were on the correct trajectory for the far more complex woolly mammoth. It demonstrated that their process could move from digital analysis to living, breathing reality at a breathtaking pace.\n\n## The Dinosaur Question & The Hard Stop of Deep Time\n\nInevitably, the conversation turns to the one extinct group that captures the universal imagination: dinosaurs. \"Believe it or not, we get the dinosaur question all the time,\" the founder said with a knowing laugh. \"Why?\"\n\nThe answer lies in the unforgiving nature of deep time. The oldest DNA Colossal works with is approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million years old, from a steppe mammoth. The idea of finding viable dinosaur DNA, however, is a different matter entirely.\n\n\"I don't like to use the word 'impossible',\" he clarified. \"I think it's very *unlikely* that we'll ever get dino DNA.\" The extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago places them far beyond the current horizon of genetic recovery. He debunked the popular \"amber\" theory, explaining that amber, found in warm, humid environments, is actually a terrible preserver of DNA. It's porous, allowing microorganisms to infiltrate and degrade the genetic material over millions of years.\n\n\"So I don't think we'll ever get true dino DNA, even though you see the occasional clickbait article on Instagram, right? And I fall for them, too. I click on them every time.\"\n\nThis established a fascinating boundary for de-extinction. The field isn't a magical portal to any point in the past, but a scientific discipline constrained by the half-life of DNA itself. The practical window, for now, seems to extend back about 1 to 2 million years into the Early Pleistocene epoch.\n\n## A Pleistocene Menagerie of Possibilities\n\nWhile dinosaurs are off the table, the Pleistocene offers a spectacular array of candidates. This period was a \"golden age\" for de-extinction, filled with megafauna that could fundamentally reshape ecosystems.\n\nThe founder's eyes lit up as he listed them: \"There were woolly rhinos. There was the giant ground sloth. There was a thing called a glyptodon, which is... think of an armadillo the size of a Volkswagen Beetle.\" He described a \"giant beaver\" that stood nearly six feet tall. \"Which is either the dumbest or the scariest thing. It's not clear.\"\n\nThis period is a treasure trove of biological diversity waiting to be explored, a testament to the fact that even with a two-million-year limit, the potential for restoration is immense. He even touched upon the Titanoboa, a colossal, super-anaconda-like creature from five or six million years ago. \"We would never bring that back, even if we had its DNA.\" Some lines, it seems, are drawn not just by science, but by primal common sense. \"Anaconda as a film or a series is way scarier than Jurassic Park... like, snakes playing in that would be even more terrifying.\"\n\n## The Near Future: An Ark of Artificial Wombs\n\nLooking forward, the founder outlined a vision that feels both science-fictional and imminent. \"The thing that will blow people's minds,\" he began, \"is that there will be a time when you walk into a lab and every endangered species is there. It'll be almost like Noah's Ark.\" Alongside them, extinct species would be developing in artificial wombs.\n\nWhen asked for a timeline, he was confident: \"A decade.\" To an outsider, a decade might seem distant, but from his perspective, immersed in the accelerating timeline of their work, \"a decade feels like tomorrow.\" This is the tangible, near-term future of conservation: a biobank where species are no longer lost, but paused, awaiting the right conditions for their return.\n\nHe also highlighted lesser-known animals, like the Steller's sea cow, a manatee or dugong the size of a whale. \"It's very large, but very docile. Everyone in the world loves that animal; it's hard to hate it.\" Driven to extinction by humans within just 30-50 years of its discovery, its return would be a powerful act of restorative justice, once the artificial womb technology for such a large marine mammal is perfected.\n\n## The Larger Vision: Synthesizing Biology and Habitat\n\nBeyond de-extinction itself lies a grander, more integrated future. The founder and his co-founder often speculate on the convergence of synthetic biology, AI, and eventually quantum computing. This isn't just about bringing back the past; it's about engineering a new, symbiotic relationship with nature.\n\nHe posed a series of provocative, visionary questions: \"What if we started a plants company and engineered a tree to grow like a tree house? Could you engineer a tree to have built-in bioluminescence from fungi for lighting? Could you create a structure you could live in?\"\n\nThis \"weird\" idea points to a future where technology doesn't stand against nature, but integrates with it. Imagine \"skyscraper trees\" that grow only as tall as they need for photosynthesis, creating dense, vertical forests. Or \"sentinel\" plants engineered to react to environmental pressures or chemical signals. Imagine natural barriers—forests of trees with the strength of titanium—acting as impassable walls between conflicting nations. \"No one's driving a tank through that, right? It's insanity.\"\n\nIn this expansive view, de-extinction is merely the starting point, the \"merch\" that draws people in. \"What's inside is so much bigger,\" he explained. \"People don't fully grasp it, but that's okay. Even if they just get to the tip of the iceberg...\"\n\n## The Unintended Audience: Inspiring the Next Generation\n\nA fascinating and unexpected pattern has emerged: their most passionate and informed audience is children. Despite not actively targeting youth programming, their message has resonated powerfully with the next generation.\n\n\"I was at a conference last week where three or four people said, 'My kid was telling me about this,'\" he shared. This grassroots, bottom-up excitement is precisely what they hope for. \"We want to inspire the next generation.\"\n\nThis phenomenon was crystallized in a remarkable story from the Maldives. The founder, on vacation with his wife, overheard a mother and child arguing about a sound in the trees. The mother insisted it was a dodo. The child, no more than a few years old, corrected her: \"That's not a dodo. The dodo is our thing.\" A debate ensued, with the child insisting, \"They are extinct. But there is actually a company working to bring the dodo back.\"\n\n\"This is a kid. We're talking about a tiny little island in the Maldives,\" the founder recalled, still amazed. He turned and informed the mother that her son was correct, revealing he worked for the very company the child was referencing. The child, it turned out, recognized the Colossal logo on his shirt. \"For me, that was a mind-blowing moment... We've sparked that curiosity. And I think we need that now more than ever.\"\n\nThis \"halo effect\" is perhaps the most significant, if unquantifiable, impact of their work. \"If bringing back a mammoth inspires 20 kids who go on to cure cancer, I don't think we can measure that.\"\n\n## A Techno-Optimist's Horizon\n\nThe conversation culminated in a sweeping vision of the next 30 years, a future where the convergence of biology and technology solves humanity's greatest challenges.\n\n\"If you fast-forward the clock 30 years, I think we will have cured all major diseases,\" he stated. He envisions an average life expectancy of 200 years or more, with a healthspan—the period of life spent in good health—reaching 150 to 180 years. \"I truly believe 150 is the new 40,\" he said, only half-joking.\n\nHe pointed to existing progress: cancer vaccines in development, solutions for diabetes and obesity on the horizon, and drugs that can lower LDL cholesterol to newborn-like levels. \"There are things today that we have actually solved.\"\n\nAugmented by AI and computational power, he believes cellular reprogramming and epigenetic reversal will become routine, making healthcare unrecognizable from today's model.\n\nFurthermore, he envisions a world where de-extinction and \"geo-engineering\" merge. Through biobanking and AI-driven adaptation, we could not only produce endangered or extinct species but also actively tune and adapt their ecosystems, reintroducing them to a world made ready for them once more.\n\nIn this future, the lines between conservation, creation, and integration blur, pointing toward a world where humanity doesn't just stop its destructive impact but begins to actively, intelligently, and symbiotically co-author the natural world.\n\nThis sets the stage for the final, crucial frontier: the ethical landscape and the global conversation that will ultimately determine the boundaries of this new power.\n## The Ethical Frontier: Navigating the Uncharted Territory of De-Extinction\n\nAs the conversation pivots from technological possibility to practical application, the dialogue naturally arrives at the most complex frontier: the ethical landscape. The speaker acknowledges this transition with a thoughtful pause, recognizing that creating capability doesn’t automatically confer permission.\n\n**\"So, can we create new species? Yes. Should we? That’s where it gets complicated.\"**\n\nThis simple dichotomy opens into a nuanced exploration of responsibility versus capability. The speaker draws a crucial distinction between what’s scientifically possible and what’s ethically advisable, using vivid examples to illustrate the spectrum:\n\n*   **The \"Game of Thrones\" scenario:** Creating fantastical creatures for spectacle\n*   **The dire wolf challenge:** Reconstructing precise historical species with high accuracy\n*   **The woolly mammoth mission:** Achieving ecological restoration through careful genetic engineering\n\n\"What people sometimes miss,\" the speaker notes, \"is that we’re actually purists in our approach. We’re trying to work in a targeted way while balancing animal welfare, editing things we know, taking as little risk as possible. But what’s important—and what sometimes gets lost—is that there’s a high level of precision here.\"\n\n### The Precision Principle and Its Limits\n\nThe conversation delves into what separates responsible de-extinction from genetic experimentation. The speaker offers a compelling test case: \"We generally know what a thylacine looked like. If I brought you a thylacine that was rabbit-sized and pink, you’d say, ‘That doesn’t look like a thylacine.’ So the point is... we can’t just engineer any trait randomly.\"\n\nThis precision principle becomes the ethical bedrock—the understanding that reconstruction requires fidelity to historical and ecological truth, not creative license. Yet the speaker acknowledges that as knowledge expands, so does possibility: \"Over time, I think we humans—and especially Colossal—will know so much about coat color, size, and all these variations that you could basically engineer a new species. Now, what would be the purpose?\"\n\n### From Spectacle to Solution: The Shift Toward Ecological Utility\n\nThe dialogue takes an unexpected turn toward practical applications that transcend mere curiosity or entertainment. The speaker becomes animated discussing microorganisms that consume waste metals to create gold nanoparticles, or enzymes that break down plastic. \"I thought, can we supercharge this and just make an alchemy machine? That’s crazy.\"\n\nThis sparks a broader vision of biological solutions to environmental crises:\n\n*   **Nuclear waste-consuming organisms**\n*   **Genetically modified corals** resistant to warming and salinity changes\n*   **Rapid-reproducing algae** for sustainable food production\n\nThe food production concept particularly captures the imagination: \"Imagine if you had some base organism, like algae, that you could process to double at an insane rate. You’d have almost endless supply because you just give it oxygen and sunlight. So you could have these systems in your home and then you could actually 3D print, like a burger, a patty, that’s obviously made from this.\"\n\nThe speaker reflects on the cultural shift this would represent: \"If you ever do that, or if humanity ever does that, we’ll look back at the times when we were hunting, killing, and butchering animals for food. It will seem historically quite barbaric.\"\n\n### The Business of Conservation: New Economic Models for Restoration\n\nAs the conversation moves from ecological benefits to economic sustainability, the speaker outlines a sophisticated multi-layered approach that transcends simple zoo models or entertainment value:\n\n**1. Technological Spin-outs**\n*   Computational biology platforms for pharmaceutical rediscovery\n*   Plastic degradation companies\n*   Specialized applications of core technologies\n\n**2. The Platform Itself**\n*   End-to-end synthetic biology infrastructure\n*   Applications ranging from drought-resistant livestock to specialized crops\n*   \"I really think this end-to-end synthetic biology platform we’re building will be quite valuable over time for the various products that come out of it.\"\n\n**3. Conservation Economics**\n*   Ecotourism and rewilding models\n*   Carbon and biodiversity credits evolving into \"nature credits\"\n*   Government partnerships and subsidies for species preservation\n\nThe speaker reveals an emerging trend: \"Countries are coming to us saying, ‘We’re spending hundreds of millions on these conservation projects, but we’re not making progress. We’re not building sufficient genetic diversity. We’re seeing genetic bottlenecks. We don’t know how to mass-produce these.’\"\n\n### The Ultimate Test: Mammoths as Moral Commitment\n\nPerhaps the most revealing moment comes when addressing whether Colossal would be considered successful if it solved numerous environmental problems and spawned multiple billion-dollar companies—but never brought back the woolly mammoth.\n\n**\"That’s failure.\"**\n\nThe response is immediate and unequivocal. \"The woolly mammoth—that’s the thing everything hangs on. That’s my personal opinion... When you make a big promise, you should put all your strength behind delivering it.\"\n\nThis commitment reveals the deeper philosophy: de-extinction isn’t merely a marketing vehicle for broader biotechnology applications. It represents a moral commitment to restoration, to inspiring future generations, and to demonstrating that human technological advancement can serve ecological healing rather than just exploitation.\n\n\"The inspiration effect on the next generation when they hear these animals went extinct 10,000 years ago—that’s an unmeasurable impact. And having sustainable herds back in the ecosystem, contributing to positive ecosystem impact...\"\n\nThe conversation has now firmly established that the technological achievements, while impressive, represent only one dimension of the de-extinction story. The ethical considerations, economic models, and philosophical commitments form an equally complex landscape that will determine whether these technologies heal or harm.\n\nAs we approach the final section, the stage is set for examining the global conversation around these technologies—how different cultures, governments, and communities are responding to the possibility of species restoration, and what frameworks might guide humanity through this unprecedented ethical territory.\n## The Uncharted Territory: From Mammoths to the Nature of Life Itself\n\nThe conversation takes a sharp turn into the profound and the personal. The speaker pivots from the grand, species-level promise of the mammoth to a more intimate, human-scale responsibility: the promise made to a child.\n\n> \"I don't care about some Reddit troll at all, okay?... But what really matters to me is if there's a 10-year-old kid who has hope for us... if we don't deliver on that, I feel like I've let those kids down.\"\n\nThis isn't just about scientific progress; it's about the renewal of cosmic-scale hope. The project's success becomes a moral litmus test for humanity's ability to keep its word to the next generation, transforming a biotech venture into a covenant with the future.\n\n### The Human Question: De-Extinction's Forbidden Frontier\n\nInevitably, this leads to the elephant in the room—or rather, the human. The speaker poses the provocative, almost satirical question: **Could this technology be used to bring back the dead?**\n\nThe response is immediate and draws a stark ethical line. Colossal, the speaker asserts, has a clear, non-negotiable policy: **no work on humans or even non-human primates.** The reasoning is multifaceted:\n\n*   **Governance and Misinformation:** Any technology with human applications is licensed out to exist under a separate governance structure. \"People already have weird conspiracies about us. The last thing I want is for people to say... and then Colossal comes out with a cure for baldness. And people go, 'Wait a minute, is that mammoth hair?'\"\n*   **The \"Could\" vs. \"Should\" Chasm:** The speaker acknowledges the theoretical possibility. With a preserved DNA sample, one could create a genetic replica of an Albert Einstein or a LeBron James. But they emphatically state that this would not be a resurrection of the person.\n    *   **The Clone is Not the Original:** Using the analogy of cloned pets, they note that while genetically identical, the clone's behavior and personality are not a perfect copy. The clone would be a new individual, a twin separated by time.\n    *   **The Mystery of Experience:** \"I'm a firm believer that we are far more than the sum of our parts.\" You could not, they argue, bring back Albert Einstein's *soul* or the unique confluence of environment and experience that forged his genius. You would have a human with Einstein's cognitive potential, but not his consciousness.\n\nThis segues into a startling, almost sci-fi reality check about artificial wombs. The speaker notes that developing an artificial womb for an elephant—a monumental technical challenge they are undertaking—is actually *harder* than developing one for a human.\n\n> \"If we solve it for elephants, it will be easier for humans. I'm not saying you should do it. But there may be a time when people look back... and people might say, you know, there was a time when humans grew humans inside of humans. That's weird.\"\n\nThis highlights the one-way nature of technological progress. Once a capability is demonstrated, the ethical and social landscape around it can shift dramatically.\n\n### Fears, Critics, and the Weight of Power\n\nWhen asked about his personal fears and the strongest criticisms of his work, the speaker's concerns are not about online trolls but about the raw power of the technology itself.\n\nHis greatest fear is the potential for misuse, drawing a direct parallel to the COVID-19 pandemic. He expresses a belief that synthetic biology and genome engineering are \"truly and unequivocally the most valuable and most powerful technology in the world,\" possessing more power for good—and for catastrophic harm—than even nuclear weapons. The proliferation of these technologies is irreversible; the cat is out of the bag.\n\nAs for critics, he addresses three common arguments:\n\n1.  **\"You're taking money from conservation.\"** He dismisses this as uninformed, countering that all their developed technologies are open-sourced for conservation, that they are bringing *new* money to the field, and that they have raised a separate $50 million foundation dedicated solely to conservation.\n2.  **\"You're playing God.\"** His response is pragmatic and pointed: \"We play God every day when we overfish the oceans or drive a species to extinction, right?\" He frames their work not as hubris, but as a responsibility to use human intelligence and technology to correct past mistakes.\n3.  **The \"Purity\" Debate:** A small but vocal group of critics fixate on semantics—whether the resulting animal is a \"true\" mammoth. His response is both firm and flippant: call it a \"cold-tolerant elephant with mammoth-engineered alleles\" if you wish, but he won't be dictated to on nomenclature.\n\n### The Final Frontier: DNA, Mystery, and the Nature of Life\n\nThe conversation concludes on a deeply philosophical note, exploring how this work changes one's perspective on creation, nature, and life itself.\n\nFor the speaker, DNA is not just a chemical blueprint; it's \"magical.\" He describes an almost spiritual quality to the process of genetic engineering:\n\n> \"Life finds a way... It heals itself. It wants—it wants to work. Whatever anyone says—and probably many of my scientists would disagree with this—there is a purposiveness to it.\"\n\nThis isn't a rejection of science, but an acknowledgment of its limits. He believes in God and sees a \"purposiveness\" woven into the fabric of reality, from the mathematical language of astrophysics to the resilient, self-organizing nature of DNA. He's comfortable with mystery.\n\n> \"I'm fine with not knowing everything. And I think that's where a lot of times people make the biggest mistakes, right?... We humans sometimes get very... egotistical and arrogant. And we say, no, but we've solved it. We have the answer. And, you know, I've always been a little bit more open-minded, actually. I think we don't know as much as we think we know.\"\n\n### Conclusion: A Journey of Responsibility and Wonder\n\nThis final leg of the journey reveals that de-extinction is far more than a technical checklist. It is a project layered with profound ethical commitments—to a child's hope, to ecological restoration, and to wielding unprecedented power with humility.\n\nIt forces a re-examination of the most fundamental questions: What is life? What is our responsibility to it? And where does human ingenuity end and the inherent, mysterious \"purposiveness\" of nature begin?\n\nThe work at Colossal stands at the precipice of a new era, not just of biotechnology, but of human self-conception. It demands that we proceed with both the boldness of pioneers and the reverence of those who understand that some mysteries are not meant to be solved, only respected. The promise of a mammoth walking the tundra again is not just a symbol of what we can reclaim, but a test of who we will become in the process."
