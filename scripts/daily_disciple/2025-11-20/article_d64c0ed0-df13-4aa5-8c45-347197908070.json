      "string": "The Supreme Court of India has reversed its earlier decision imposing a timeline for Governors and the President to act on bills passed by state legislatures. Previously, the Court had set deadlines—such as one month for Governors and three months for the President—to grant assent, withhold, return, or reserve bills. It also introduced the concept of 'deemed assent' if no action was taken. In a significant U-turn, a five-judge constitutional bench ruled that the judiciary cannot impose such timelines or create legal fictions like deemed assent, as these powers are constitutionally granted to the executive under Articles 200 and 201. The Court clarified that while it cannot set general deadlines, it can still review delays on a case-by-case basis under judicial review."

      "markdown_string": "# Supreme Court Reverses Timeline for Governors on Bills\n\nIn a landmark reversal, the Supreme Court of India has overturned its own earlier decision imposing timelines on Governors and the President for giving assent to bills passed by state legislatures. This move clarifies the constitutional separation of powers and reaffirms the discretionary authority of Governors and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution.\n\n## Background: The Original Ruling\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court—responding to petitions from opposition-ruled states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka—had set specific deadlines for Governors to act on bills:\n\n- Governors were directed to decide on bills **within one month** of receipt.\n- If a Governor returned a bill to the legislature for reconsideration, and the legislature passed it again, the Governor had to grant assent **within one month**.\n- If the Governor reserved a bill for the President’s consideration, the President had to decide **within three months**.\n- Failure to act within these timelines would result in **deemed assent**—meaning the bill would be considered approved automatically.\n\nThis ruling was celebrated by opposition states, which had complained that Governors were deliberately withholding assent, stalling legislative work for political reasons.\n\n## The Presidential Reference and the U-Turn\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s initial ruling, President Droupadi Murmu—acting on the advice of the central government—submitted **14 questions** to the Supreme Court under the presidential reference procedure. These questions sought clarity on:\n\n- The validity of imposing timelines on constitutional authorities.\n- The scope of discretionary powers under Articles 200 and 201.\n- The legality of \"deemed assent.\"\n- The extent of judicial review and the use of Article 142 (the Supreme Court’s power to do \"complete justice\").\n\nA **five-judge constitutional bench**, led by Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai, was constituted to examine these questions.\n\n## Key Points from the Supreme Court’s Latest Judgment\n\n### 1. No Timelines Can Be Imposed\nThe Supreme Court held that it **cannot impose deadlines** on Governors or the President. The Constitution grants them discretion under:\n\n- **Article 200**: Gives Governors the power to:\n  - Grant assent\n  - Withhold assent\n  - Return the bill (except money bills)\n  - Reserve the bill for the President’s consideration\n- **Article 201**: Gives the President similar powers for reserved bills.\n\nSince the Constitution does not specify any timelines, the Court ruled that it cannot \"rewrite the Constitution\" by imposing them.\n\n### 2. Deemed Assent Is Unconstitutional\nThe Court explicitly rejected the concept of **deemed assent**, stating that there is **no constitutional basis** for automatically treating a bill as passed if the Governor or President fails to act within a set period.\n\n### 3. Limits on Article 142\nThe Court clarified that its power under **Article 142**—to pass orders for \"complete justice\"—is **not unlimited**. It cannot be used to create legal fictions (like deemed assent) that override constitutional provisions.\n\n### 4. Judicial Review Still Available\nWhile timelines and deemed assent are off the table, the Supreme Court affirmed that **judicial review remains possible** on a **case-by-case basis**. If a state believes a Governor is unduly delaying assent, it can approach the Court, which will examine:\n\n- The nature of the bill\n- Reasons for the delay\n- Past precedents\n- Impact on stakeholders\n\nThe Court will determine what constitutes a **\"reasonable time\"** for assent based on the specifics of each case.\n\n## Constitutional Implications\n\nThis judgment reinforces the **separation of powers**:\n\n- **Legislature**: Enacts laws\n- **Executive** (Governor/President): Exercises discretion to assent, withhold, or reserve bills\n- **Judiciary**: Interprets the Constitution but cannot curtail constitutional discretion\n\nThe ruling underscores that constitutional authorities must be trusted to use their powers responsibly, without judicial micromanagement.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nOpposition-ruled states can no longer rely on automatic deadlines or deemed assent. They must:\n\n- Build stronger legislative and administrative cases for their bills\n- Approach courts individually if they believe a Governor is acting mala fide\n- Engage in political and legal advocacy to ensure their legislative agenda is not stalled\n\nThis judgment is a significant recalibration of the balance between the executive and the judiciary—one that reaffirms the text and spirit of the Indian Constitution.\n\n---\n*Note: This analysis is based on the Supreme Court’s judgment and constitutional provisions. Aspirants for UPSC and other competitive exams should carefully review Articles 200 and 201, along with recent judicial interpretations.*",
