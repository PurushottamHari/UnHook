      "markdown_string": "# Vedanta: From Lower to Higher Spiritual Truth\n\n## Introduction\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome. We are so happy to welcome back as our speaker a dear and very respected friend of our society, **Dr. Jeffrey D. Long**. He is the Carl W. Eagler Professor of Religion, Philosophy, and Asian Studies at Elizabeth Town College, where he has taught since receiving his doctoral degree at the University of Chicago Divinity School in 2000.\n\nHe has written many books and articles, including *Hinduism in America: A Convergence of Worlds*, which won the Rajenda and Joti Gandhi Award for Theology, Philosophy, and Critical Engagement in 2022. His latest book is *Discovering Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist Thought*. This year, he has published through Oxford University Press a volume of Hindu primary sources with his colleague Dr. Ravi Gupta.\n\nDr. Long has spoken at a wide variety of venues, both national and international, including three presentations at the United Nations. He has also been interviewed for a PBS documentary on the life and teachings of Swami Vivekananda and for the History Channel series *Holy Marvels*.\n\nDr. Long took initiation into the Vedanta tradition in the year 2005 and is a popular and frequent speaker at Vedanta societies across the United States.\n\nThe subject of his talk today is **“From Lower Truth to Higher Truth: Vedanta in Practice.”**\n\n---\n\n## Opening Remarks\n\n> “Thank you very much, Diane, for that lovely introduction, and to all of you for being here today. The weather is not great in New York today, but you still came. So thank you very, very much. And to quote Swami Vivekananda, thank you for your kind and cordial welcome.”\n\nDr. Long began with a short prayer:\n\n> “Having taken refuge in the lotus feet of the Holy Mother Sharada Devi and the world teacher Ramakrishna, I bow to them again and again.  \n> Namaskar, namaste, good morning, and a belated Shubho Vijaya to you all.”\n\nHe reflected on the recent Durga Puja celebrations in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, noting that the joy of the occasion was still reverberating in the community. He expressed his honor at being invited to speak at the Vedanta Society of New York, founded by Swami Vivekananda himself, and thanked Swami Smaranananda and Diane for the invitation.\n\n---\n\n## The Inspiration: Huxley’s *Perennial Philosophy*\n\nDr. Long shared that this talk was inspired by his recent rereading of one of his favorite books, **Aldous Huxley’s *The Perennial Philosophy***—a work that deeply shaped his thinking from an early age. He first read it at 14, alongside foundational spiritual texts like the *Bhagavad Gita*, Paramahansa Yogananda’s *Autobiography of a Yogi*, and Swami Rama’s *Living with the Himalayan Masters*.\n\nHuxley, an initiate of Vedanta and a disciple of Swami Prabhavananda, explored a central theme: **spiritual life is about giving up the ego to experience the deeper ground of being** that underlies all existence. It is about attaining a “knowledge beyond knowledge”—not the ordinary awareness of facts, but the direct awareness of who and what we truly are.\n\nYet, paradoxically, it is not about attaining anything at all.  \n> “We already are that which we are. We are not attaining something so much as we are renouncing and giving up our ignorance and our self-imposed limitations.”\n\nDr. Long illustrated this with a line from Donovan’s Zen-inspired song, *There Is a Mountain*:\n\n> “The caterpillar sheds his skin to find a butterfly within.”\n\nWe are caterpillars who are really butterflies. Vedanta speaks of the **potential divinity within all of us**. We are not seeking our “butterfly-ness”—it is already our true nature. We are seeking to shed our temporary caterpillar self: the ego.\n\n---\n\n## The Paradox of Spiritual Language\n\nAs soon as we become serious about spiritual life, we encounter paradoxes:\n\n- We are on a journey that is not really a journey.\n- We seek a place that is not really a place.\n- We search for something that was never really lost.\n\nWhy is spirituality so paradoxical?  \n> “The answer is itself something of a paradox. Spiritual life as such is not paradoxical at all. It is self-knowledge. It appears paradoxical because of the ways in which we try to speak about it.”\n\nLanguage falls short when describing profound experiences. How do we describe the color blue to someone who has never seen color? How do we put love into words? The experience of the “ground of being”—or **Brahman**, in the language of the Upanishads—is beyond time, space, and causation. Our words, formed to navigate the conventional world, cannot fully capture it.\n\nThis is why:\n- **Adi Shankaracharya** said the divine reality is “thou before whom all words recoil.”\n- The *Brihadaranyaka Upanishad* describes it as *neti, neti*—\"not this, not that.\"\n- The *Tao Te Ching* opens: “The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.”\n- The Buddha sometimes responded with **silence** when asked about ultimate reality.\n\n> “Silence, it seems, is the best way to express the truth of the ground of being.”\n\nBut even silence must be understood. Dr. Long recalled a professor who would ask his silent class:\n\n> “Is this the silence of profound wisdom, or the silence of profound ignorance?”\n\nThere is a vital distinction between:\n- The silence of a mind that knows nothing.\n- The silence of a mind that has realized the “no-thing”—the reality beyond all forms.\n\n---\n\n## The Amphibious Human Condition\n\nMost of us exist somewhere between ignorance and wisdom. We are, in Huxley’s words, **spiritually amphibious**—moving back and forth between the spiritual and mundane realms.\n\n> “One moment you’re deep in meditation, the next you’re trying to find a parking spot.”\n\nIn this state, we need words, symbols, and metaphors. Even teachers known for silence—like Sri Shivabalayogi, Meher Baba, or Mahavira—saw their followers translate their silence into words for the benefit of others.\n\n> “We amphibians of the spiritual life need words if we are to climb onto the solid land of realization.”\n\n---\n\n## The Finger and the Moon\n\nA classic Zen image illustrates the role of spiritual teachings:\n\nWhen we see the full moon rising, we point to it until others see it for themselves. Once they see it, we lower our hand.\n\n> “Words, symbols, and belief systems are the **finger pointing at the moon**—the realization of the ground of being. If we mistake the finger for the moon, we risk becoming fanatical and regressing spiritually.”\n\nSwami Vivekananda taught that we are **“not traveling from error to truth, but from truth to truth—from lower truth to higher truth.”**\n\nEven in ignorance, we have some knowledge—inherited from family, society, education, the internet, and even past lives (as *sanskaras* and *vasanas*). But at some point, a sense of unease arises. We ask, in the words of Peggy Lee:\n\n> “Is this all there is? Is there nothing more?”\n\n---\n\n## Choosing Our Path\n\nDr. Long referenced Plato’s myth of Er, in which souls choose their next life based on what will best help them learn and grow. Similarly, in the Hindu tradition, we choose our life in the *Devachan* (between-life realm) and then enter the *Karmabhoomi* (the realm of action) to do our work—our *karma*.\n\n> “We have work to do. We have karma to work through.”\n\nAs we move through life, we may sense the path we need to take—an intuition, a resonance, a memory of the choice we made. We seek knowledge that will transform us into who we are meant to be.\n\n---\n\n## From Belief to Knowledge\n\nMuch of what we “know” is actually **belief**—secondhand knowledge accepted on faith. For example, most of us believe in subatomic particles without having done the experiments ourselves.\n\nIn spiritual life, we begin with a **“working theory of reality.”** This may be inherited or chosen, but it is not yet direct knowledge. The goal is to move from belief to **knowledge**—from theoretical understanding to direct realization.\n\n> “According to Vedanta, we are inherently divine. We are the ground of all being. Yet we are shockingly ignorant of our own true nature.”\n\nWe have “unlearned” our true nature and identified with the ego. Our task is to reverse this—to “relearn” who we truly are.\n\n---\n\n## The Danger of Fanaticism\n\nSwami Vivekananda warned:\n\n> “It is very good to be born in a church, but it is very bad to die in a church.”\n\nAttachment to beliefs, practices, or institutions can hinder growth. Fanaticism arises from **fear**—the fear of losing what we cling to. But true knowledge, once realized, cannot be taken away.\n\n> “If we are still clinging fanatically to what we claim to know, it is a sure sign that we do not yet truly know it.”\n\nVedanta encourages us to see our path as a **beginner’s guide**—a finger pointing to the moon, not the moon itself.\n\n---\n\n## The Path of Practice\n\nDr. Long shared a story about his uncle, who tried meditation for 10 minutes once and declared it didn’t work. Spiritual practice requires **diligence and patience**.\n\n> “A rosebud is not an imperfect rose. It is perfect just as it is. In time, it will blossom.”\n\nWe must persist in daily meditation and practice, even when we feel nothing is happening. As the *Bhagavad Gita* assures:\n\n> “On this path, no effort goes to waste, and no loss is incurred.”\n\n---\n\n## The Transformation: Lower to Higher Knowledge\n\nAs we practice, belief transforms into knowledge. For example, a belief in rebirth becomes knowledge when a past-life memory arises.\n\nBut even this knowledge is still **lower knowledge**—capable of being expressed in words. The ultimate goal is **higher knowledge**: the direct, wordless realization of the Self.\n\n> “We seek knowledge in order to be transformed. But there is a higher knowledge which requires us to be transformed in order to perceive it in the first place.”\n\nThis is not a one-time event. We remain amphibious, moving between realms. Yet, as we evolve, the mundane becomes spiritualized. We become like the *jivanmukta*—liberated in this lifetime—who, in Shankara’s words, “wears no outward mark” and experiences the world like a child.\n\n---\n\n## The Many Paths to the One Goal\n\nVedanta recognizes multiple paths to realization:\n\n- **Jnana Yoga**: The path of knowledge—reminding oneself, “I am not this body, I am not this mind, I am the Self.”\n- **Bhakti Yoga**: The path of loving devotion to the Divine.\n- **Karma Yoga**: The path of selfless service.\n- **Raja Yoga**: The royal path of meditation and mind control.\n\n> “Whatever path we take, whatever combination of yogas we use, the key is to be diligent—though not fanatical—and to, in the words of Swami Vivekananda, ‘Stop not until the goal is reached.’”\n\nThen, we can truly say, not as belief but as lived reality:\n\n> **“Aham Brahmasmi—I am Brahman.”**\n\n---\n\n## Q&A Highlights\n\n### On Lower Self and Higher Self\n\n**Attendee**: In the *Bhagavad Gita*, Krishna speaks of controlling the lower self with the higher self. How does this fit with the caterpillar-butterfly metaphor?\n\n**Dr. Long**: The higher self can be understood as an intermediary—a limb of the highest Self that guides us through intuition and conscience. The highest Self is silent, beyond time and space. When we realize it, we see that even the lower self was always That.\n\n### On Returning to the Church\n\n**Attendee**: Swami Vivekananda said it’s good to be born in a church but not to die in one. Yet, don’t we come from God and return to God?\n\n**Dr. Long**: Using Paul Ricoeur’s model, we move from:\n- **Naïve faith** (childhood belief)\n- to **skepticism** (questioning)\n- to **second naïveté** (mature, reflective faith)\n\nWe return to the teachings of our youth, but with deeper understanding. Vivekananda urged us not to remain in naïve faith or skepticism, but to seek a higher, experiential truth.\n\n### On Teachers of Silence\n\n**Attendee**: What about Ramana Maharshi, who taught through silence?\n\n**Dr. Long**: Yes, Ramana Maharshi—like Ramakrishna—often taught through silence. His gaze conveyed what words could not. Silence is a profound spiritual discipline, especially for those of us who speak for a living. It allows us to perceive the “screen” behind the “film” of daily experience.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDr. Long closed with gratitude and a final reflection:\n\n> “Thank you all very, very much.”\n\nThe talk wove together philosophy, poetry, and personal insight—offering a rich exploration of Vedanta’s timeless wisdom: that we are already what we seek, and the journey is one of awakening to that truth.\n\n---\n\n*Tags: #Vedanta #Philosophy #Yoga #Meditation*  \n*Category: SPIRITUALITY*",
