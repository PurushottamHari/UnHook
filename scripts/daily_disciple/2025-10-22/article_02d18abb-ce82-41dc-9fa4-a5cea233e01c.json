      "string": "In July 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not purchase US dollars in the spot market for the first time in 11 years, a move last seen in February 2014. Instead, the RBI sold dollars to defend the rupee from excessive depreciation amid global factors like US trade tariffs, capital outflows, and domestic issues such as a widening trade deficit and FPI outflows. Concurrently, the RBI increased its gold reserves, raising gold's share in forex reserves from 8.9% to over 12% within a year, reflecting a strategic shift to stabilize the rupee and hedge against economic uncertainties."

      "markdown_string": "## RBI Skips Dollar Purchases, Buys Gold in Major Strategy Shift\n\nIn a significant and unusual move, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not purchase any US dollars in the spot market during July—marking the first time such an event has occurred in 11 years. This strategic pause on dollar acquisitions represents a notable shift in the central bank's approach to managing the nation's foreign exchange reserves and stabilizing the Indian rupee.\n\n### The RBI's Traditional Role in Forex Markets\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the RBI actively intervenes in the foreign exchange market to maintain the rupee's stability. Its primary objective is to prevent extreme volatility:\n\n*   **If the rupee appreciates too rapidly** (e.g., moving from ₹85 to ₹80 against the US dollar), the RBI steps in to *buy US dollars*. This increases the demand for dollars, helps curb the rupee's rapid appreciation, and simultaneously adds to the nation's forex reserves.\n*   **Conversely, if the rupee depreciates too quickly** (e.g., falling from ₹85 to ₹90 against the dollar), the RBI *sells US dollars* from its reserves. This increased supply of dollars in the market helps stabilize the rupee's falling value.\n\nThis balancing act has historically helped build India's substantial foreign exchange reserves, which have hovered around the $600 billion mark.\n\n### The July Anomaly: A Defensive Posture\n\nThe data from July reveals a stark departure from this routine:\n\n*   The RBI purchased **$0** in US dollars on the spot market.\n*   This stands in sharp contrast to the previous month, June, when the central bank had purchased **$5.6 billion**.\n*   Furthermore, in July, the RBI was a net *seller* of dollars.\n\nThis is the first instance of zero dollar purchases since February 2014, underscoring the uniqueness of the current economic climate.\n\n### Why Did the RBI Halt Dollar Purchases?\n\nThe primary driver behind this strategic shift was the significant pressure on the Indian rupee. In July, the rupee was undergoing a sustained period of depreciation, threatening to breach the psychological barrier of ₹90 against the US dollar.\n\nThe RBI's objective was clear: defend the rupee. By forgoing dollar purchases and instead selling dollars, the central bank prioritized currency stability over the accumulation of forex reserves. Had it followed its traditional playbook and bought dollars amidst the rupee's decline, the depreciation could have accelerated, potentially pushing the rupee past the ₹90 mark. Despite these defensive measures, the rupee still touched its lowest levels, hovering around 88.5-88.8, illustrating the intensity of the pressure.\n\n### What Caused the Rupee's Pressure?\n\nA combination of global and domestic factors contributed to the rupee's weakness:\n\n**Global Factors:**\n*   **US Trade Policies:** The trade war initiated by the Trump administration led to capital flight from emerging markets, including India.\n*   **Strong US Dollar:** A robust US dollar index and rising US Treasury yields made dollar-denominated assets more attractive, pulling foreign investment away from India.\n\n**Domestic Factors:**\n*   **Widening Trade Deficit:** India's imports outpaced its exports.\n*   **Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Outflows:** Foreign investors, spooked by global and local uncertainties, began pulling money out of the Indian stock market.\n*   **Increased Corporate Dollar Demand:** Indian companies scrambled to buy dollars to hedge against potential losses, further increasing the dollar's demand and the rupee's downward pressure.\n\n### The Parallel Strategy: Accumulating Gold\n\nWhile stepping back from the dollar, the RBI has been proactively increasing its gold reserves. This is a calculated, long-term strategy that has paid off handsomely.\n\n*   In July alone, the RBI purchased approximately half a ton of gold.\n*   The share of gold in India's total forex reserves has seen a notable increase—rising from **8.9% in July 2023 to over 12% by July 2024**.\n*   This accumulation has proven prescient, as gold prices have seen a sharp, almost doubling increase over the past year and a half, significantly boosting the value of the RBI's holdings.\n\nOn the global stage, India now holds the **ninth-largest gold reserves** among central banks, with **888 tons**, a figure that has been steadily growing.\n\n### Conclusion: A Shift in Focus\n\nThe RBI's decision to skip dollar purchases in July was a defensive maneuver aimed squarely at protecting the rupee from extreme depreciation in a volatile global environment. It signals a temporary shift in priority from reserve accumulation to currency defense. Concurrently, the sustained buying of gold highlights a strategic diversification of India's forex reserves, a move that has enhanced the portfolio's value and resilience. This two-pronged approach reflects the central bank's adaptive response to complex geopolitical and economic challenges, including ongoing trade wars and post-pandemic oil shocks.",
