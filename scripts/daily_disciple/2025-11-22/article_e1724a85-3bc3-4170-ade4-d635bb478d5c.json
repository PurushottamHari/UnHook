He emphasizes the importance of perseverance, sharing that it took 13 years of relentless work, including performing 25-28 comedy sets per weekend, before achieving his breakthrough. Hart highlights learning from failure, the value of finishing what you start, and not being afraid to ask questions to gain knowledge. He credits his mother's strict guidance and his own drive for his success, stressing that true achievement comes from dedication and a willingness to be the 'dummy' in the room to learn and grow."

      "markdown_string": "# Kevin Hart on Success, Perseverance, and Learning\n\n## The Power of Admitting Ignorance\n\n**You can’t be afraid to verbalize your ignorance. That’s holding you back.**\n\nKevin Hart leans forward, his expression turning serious. He’s explaining one of the core principles that has allowed him to expand from stand-up comedy into a sprawling business empire. For him, the journey into venture capital and investing began with a simple, uncomfortable admission: *I don’t know.*\n\n“I can give you several examples, like investing,” he says. “Like, you're telling me that if I put this money in here right now, I get 30x, 20x. What the… a scam? I know a scam when I see one. Go find you another idiot, cuz it ain't happening over here, buddy.”\n\nHis initial reaction was one of deep-seated distrust, born from an environment where you protected what was yours. But the breakthrough came when he shifted his approach.\n\n“But when you go, you say, 'I don't know what that means. How does investing really work? I don't know where to get it.' Now you're a part of the right conversations. You're part of the right opportunities, but you get there by being the dummy in them. And now look at what I'm able to do.”\n\nHe argues that the bigger problem for many people is the insecure silence around the things they don’t know.\n\n“You're never going to run into a person who's randomly going to talk about the things that you wish you had more knowledge in. It will never happen. And what you'll find is that information is not free, but it's available… It's only hard to people that are very insecure about just verbalizing, 'I don't know where to get it.'”\n\n---\n\n## The 13-Year Grind: Why He Never Quit\n\nThe host points out a staggering fact: it took 13 years from Kevin’s first stand-up gig to his true breakthrough moment.\n\n“Why didn't you quit?” he’s asked.\n\nThe answer lies in North Philadelphia, with a mother determined to break a cycle. “Because of the lessons that my mom gave from being very scarred from my brother,” Kevin explains.\n\nHe paints a vivid picture of his upbringing: his brother sold drugs, his father was in and out of jail and struggled with addiction, and his mother, Nancy Hart, was fiercely protective of her younger son.\n\n“My mom wasn't going to let that happen with me. So, we had an agreement. I had a certain amount of time to make comedy work. And in my mind, it wasn't going to be hard because there was no other option. I would figure it out.”\n\nHe describes a period of relentless work: driving from Philadelphia to New York every day, returning home at 4:00 a.m., doing “25 to 28 sets a weekend.”\n\n“The struggle left you with days of, 'What am I doing? Can I pay my rent?' …But my mom's biggest lesson was, 'You're not quitting.'”\n\nHe contrasts this with what he sees as a common modern trap. “Not many people are going to do the 13 years of hard. Most people opt out at year two and want to go find a quick return. Well, you keep quitting to start something else that you think is the idea. It's just a cycle. You're never completing anything.”\n\nHis philosophy is simple and brutal: “You got to make a choice of the thing you're going to do and finish. I made the choice that stand-up comedy was what I was going to finish. Because if I focused and did it well, that would open up the doors for me to do everything else that I want to do.”\n\nHe illustrates this with an analogy from his manager, Scooter Braun. Imagine a million-dollar prize for hitting a fastball from the best pitcher in baseball. The line to try would be endless on day one.\n\n“Not many people would… miss and then go stand back in line to go hit the ball again… What you'll find is that the line will get smaller and smaller because of how many people are dropping out… Not many people are going to wait through the 13 years of hardship.”\n\n---\n\n## The Graph of a Career: A Visual Journey of Struggle and Success\n\nTo understand his trajectory, Kevin is asked to draw an imaginary graph of his career, with age on one axis and success on the other.\n\nHe starts at age 18: “Success for me, knowing what I want to do in life, comes here.” But the line for money and revenue? “We flatlining.”\n\nHe then details the slow, arduous climb:\n*   **22 years old:** Grinding through 25-28 comedy sets a weekend, driving between cities, finally starting to make $400-$500 a week.\n*   **The first bump:** Getting into a comedy festival. “That's when the industry saw me. Who's this new guy? …This guy here, he's got something.”\n*   **A holding deal:** A $250,000 deal from ABC that ultimately went nowhere. “So, we're flatlining here. Now, I'm just waiting for the phone to ring.”\n*   **The self-creation pivot:** Realizing he could create his own shows. “Oh my god. Show gets picked up… There's a pattern. I can do that as much as I want.”\n*   **The move to LA:** “No plan, no nothing. Flatline… This is weird. I don't like this work.”\n*   **The road:** Becoming a headliner, working colleges and clubs for a “very, very long time,” eventually selling out comedy clubs.\n*   **The next leap:** Moving from clubs to theaters. “Boom. Let's go here.”\n*   **The rocket ship:** Theatres start selling out. Then, the movie roles begin. *Think Like a Man* ($90 million box office), *Ride Along* ($140 million), *Central Intelligence*. “The movies just started to pow, get hard… it just happened so fast.”\n\nIt was at this peak that his mindset evolved again. “While this is happening, I should figure out how to kind of create my own source of opportunity… I'm gonna start a production company.” This led to Heartbeat Ventures (VC investing), brand partnerships (Chase, DraftKings, Fabletics), and owning his own brands (Gran Coramino tequila).\n\nHe connects this entire sprawling ecosystem back to his mother’s earliest lesson: “My mom's biggest lesson was, you're not quitting. If you start it, you're going to finish it… How do I make my partners know I'm willing to give my all? How do I show that I'm not going to quit?”\n\n---\n\n## The \"Moment\" and the Fuel of Passion\n\nFor years, Kevin worked in obscurity. “Nobody believed that I was funny when I said I was going to be a comedian… 'You funny but not comedian funny.' …'I'm going to be a star.' 'No, I don't know, man.'”\n\nSo what kept him going through the doubt and the financial strain?\n\n“I was believing in the idea that I finally found the thing that I want to do… I found the thing that I want to do and I'm not going to quit it because I love it this much and I strongly believe that the sun is at the end of this dark tunnel, but I got to be willing to get there.”\n\nHe recalls a pivotal moment watching Cat Williams destroy the stage at the BET Comedy Awards. “He had like a leopard suit, destroyed… audience goes crazy, stands up. I remember being in the audience and I was like, that's it… I got to be patient because my moment is going to come. I witnessed his moment… my takeaway was that he was ready for the moment.”\n\nKevin’s own moment came at Shaq’s All-Star Comedy Jam. He delivered one of his best sets, and the crowd gave him a standing ovation. “In that moment… that was the moment that then took me and shot me out the cannon.” That led directly to the massive success of his next special, *Seriously Funny*, which catapulted him into arenas and global stardom.\n\nHe explains the core fuel wasn’t fame or money, but the laugh itself. “There's nothing better than to laugh… Hearing people laugh, I was like, 'Oh… that feels different.' …I feel like I'm doing a service of good. If I can make people feel better, if I can brighten up your day, it's a service of good.”\n\n---\n\n## The Cost of Ambition and the Definition of a Good Man\n\nThe host poses a critical question: “They say that you can't have everything in life… What is the cost of this pursuit?”\n\n“Time,” Kevin answers immediately. His ambition is insatiable. “You for sure have your days. I'm absolutely stressed out. I'm stressed the… out on the daily, but I operate within stress.”\n\nWhen asked if he’s happy, he responds, “I'm 10,000% happy, but I'm stressed out with the concept of I have to do.” He’s learned to set boundaries, to reach a point in the day where he simply shuts down. “The healthy side comes with silence for a sec. Like you need… some silence. A ride in a car by yourself, no music.”\n\nThe conversation turns to the modern crisis of masculinity. Kevin believes the waters are “extremely polluted.” His own definition of a good man is rooted in the lessons he learned from his father’s failures and his mother’s strength.\n\n“I was raised on a foundation of a leader or leadership.” He recalls his father’s later-year accountability. “'Kevin, I love you and I love your brother, but I can't go back. I can only say I'm sorry'… His accountability in that moment is what I remember the most about my father and love the most.”\n\nFor his own sons, he focuses on “leadership, responsibility, accountability.” He sees value in emotions and sharing struggles, but tempers it with a dose of reality. “You also in a world where you know weakness can at some point in time be taken advantage of… It doesn't mean that your emotions don't matter because they do. It means that you also have to be smart and aware.”\n\nHis closing thoughts on the topic are a plea for personal definition and tolerance. “In a time today, my makeup doesn't have to fit yours. And I'm okay with that… I think we're in a time today where society wants to fight with one another about… it's just too much of like, 'Well, if you don't see it my way, then you're dumb.' …It's okay with not being okay with my choice. That's okay.”\n\n---\n\n## The Best Advice He Ever Received\n\nAs the conversation wraps up, Kevin is asked about the most impactful advice he ever received as an adult. He credits Chris Rock.\n\n“Chris Rock told me early in my comedy career… His exact word is, 'You don't just want to make… laugh.' The world is so much bigger than your block or your neighborhood. He said, 'Get out the country. Get out the country and figure out a way to make the world laugh and comedy will be so much better.'”\n\nAt the time, Kevin’s material was hyper-local. This advice pushed him to broaden his perspective, to find universality in his humor. This principle of venturing into the unfamiliar became the bedrock of his entire career, allowing him to expand fearlessly into business and investing.\n\nLooking ahead 10 years, Kevin Hart’s version of success is strikingly simple.\n\n“I think in 10 years time, if I'm able to sit on a stool at a comedy club with 30 people and do material and enjoy my craft… and I golf… and I spend time with my kids and hopefully their kids… and mailbox money is attached to things that I've built that are operating and functioning on its own. That's… my version of success.”",
