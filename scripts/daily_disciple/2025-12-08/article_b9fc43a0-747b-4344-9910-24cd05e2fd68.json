      "string": "The video explores the concept of a 'divine' aura, distinct from regular charisma, which grants an unshakeable stability that captivates others. It argues this aura stems from a profound, often traumatic, personal transformation where all emotional and intellectual defenses fail, forcing a connection to a deep, internal 'divine' source. This connection creates an empathic stability that others sense. However, the video warns that this state is not developed through seeking or ego, but often through extreme suffering, and can lead to dangerous outcomes like cult leadership if combined with an unchecked ego. It advises against actively pursuing this transformation, recommending instead a balanced life focused on well-being."

      "markdown_string": "# The Source of a 'Divine' Aura and Its Dangers\n\nAll right, kids. Today we're going to talk about where aura comes from. And I want to be precise here. We were thinking about titling this \"How to Develop Aura,\" but I'm going to be straight with y'all: the kind of aura we're talking about—I'm not sure it can be *developed*. I'm really excited about this because I find it incredibly fascinating.\n\nWe're not talking about regular charisma. This is the ability to walk into a room and have people *notice* you're there. People can approach you upset, frustrated, and you remain stable. People can be incredibly powerful, intimidating, wealthy—but this kind of person with this aura is untouched by all of that. This is real aura, not the scientific charisma based on oration skill or social techniques. This is an internal quality that allows someone to captivate an entire room.\n\nIt's a bit harder to talk about, but it can be analyzed. That's what we're going to do.\n\n## The Missing Piece in Charisma Research\n\nLet's start with the research on charisma. There's a great paper I've discussed before, where I made a video on how to develop charisma in a sequential way, breaking down its components. But in that video and in this paper, there's an element of charisma the authors choose not to include: something called **divine-related**. This is what we're talking about today—the aura human beings associate with divinity.\n\nThe emphasis on charisma outside of divinity or religion is relatively new. In research, people have basically said, \"Oh, that's weird, mysterious stuff. We don't know what it is,\" so they ignore it and focus on what can be measured and studied. But if we look at the whole of charisma research, we see that in countries like France and Canada, **religion is the most commonly discussed scholarly subject** when it comes to charisma. Out of all papers ever published on charisma, religion is actually number two in the academic study of it.\n\nI think we've lost something. We all acknowledge that when it comes to true aura, religion or divinity have something to do with it. At the top of the list are people who started religions—Jesus, Buddha. Then we have figures like Joan of Arc. These major religious figures started a religion. There was something so special about their aura that human beings flocked to them, and after they passed, what they taught continued for thousands of years.\n\nI know how arrogant it sounds to say I'll explain what that is, but I think we can look at these publications and get a sense of where it really comes from. That's what's so fascinating. I think we can actually crack that nut. As insane as it sounds, if you observe something in the world, there is an analytical method you can use to understand it—including the really weird, mysterious stuff.\n\n## The Empathic Circuit and Breaking the Script\n\nLet's start with the basics. The first really basic thing about all these people is the way empathy works with them.\n\nAll human beings have empathic circuits. When I see you crying, the visual stimulus turns my brain on in certain ways. When you feel sad, I might feel sad. We feel together. I'm capable of feeling what you're feeling, and you're capable of feeling what I'm feeling. We have all these weird dynamics we play into.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned people who are intimidating, rich, or powerful. There's all this weird empathic stuff that goes on when one of these people enters a room. There's the person who's the top dog. When the top dog enters, everyone fawns and flocks around them. There's a certain social respect. When people approach the top dog, usually one of two things happens: you respond appropriately or neutrally, or if you're in defiance—if top dogs bother you—you're stern with them.\n\nWhen someone really popular enters a room, there's a weird social script everyone enacts.\n\n**Someone with charisma doesn't play into that script.**\n\nHere's why: when we empathically connect with someone who has true aura, what we feel on the inside is incredibly uncommon. They have what feels like **a soul made of steel**. There's something about them that makes them impossible to perturb. The regular empathic \"crap\" we get from and signal to other people—like, \"Oh my god, you lack self-confidence and you're stuttering, that gives me the ick\"—doesn't happen.\n\nWe have the person stuttering over here, the person getting the ick over here, both transmitting signals that work with each other because you feel a lack of self-confidence. When I give you the ick eye, it resonates with how you feel about yourself. You feel crappy; I'm agreeing with you.\n\nWe have all these social scripts. Someone with true aura breaks them all. When they're in a room, they don't seem to be operating that way. There's an immense amount of stability.\n\n## Where Does the Stability Come From? The Dark Night\n\nSt. John of the Cross wrote about the **Dark Night of the Soul**:\n> \"The light guided me more surely than the light of noonday to the place where he—well, I knew who was awaiting me—a place where none appeared... I remained lost in oblivion. My face I reclined on the beloved. All ceased and I abandoned myself, leaving my cares forgotten among the lilies.\"\n\nWhen we look at people who have real aura, we find a common experience. Whether it's Nelson Mandela or Orurao (a major spiritual teacher from the Hindu tradition who was imprisoned), many end up in prison or have some event that messes them up in a major way. How have their epigenetics changed? How has their brain changed?\n\nThis is the best I can put together.\n\nNormally in life, we have challenges, difficulties, negative emotions. We feel sad, hopeless, have setbacks, get dumped, feel lonely. The way most human beings survive is by balancing negative stuff with positive stuff. If I get dumped, my bros say, \"Hey man, it's okay. There are other fish in the sea.\" There's negative and positive. If I feel sad, I play video games to make it go away. We read philosophical texts, have emotional conversations, go to therapy, distract ourselves, numb ourselves with substances.\n\nWe go through life with bad stuff and good stuff. For most people, the purpose is to have more good stuff than bad stuff. I want money, love, relationships, meaning, purpose. I want less bad, more good.\n\nI believe that finding true aura—that real transformation—comes **when the good stuff no longer touches the bad stuff**. When all the good stuff is wiped away, and all you're left with is profound bad stuff. When all your compensatory mechanisms go completely out the window, and you're overwhelmed by a torrent of negativity. When everything in your life is completely falling apart, and you have no logical defense mechanism left, no emotional support. You are at your lowest point when everything else has abandoned and failed you.\n\nIn that moment, when the mind can't help you, the intellect can't help you, emotions can't help you, empathy and connection with others can't help you—in that moment, some people find something within themselves. Something so deep and primitive. It's this weird connection to the divine. That's the language we use in the hardest moments: \"finding God.\" I'm not talking about the Christian God or Hindu God. I'm talking about the phenomenological experience we see in scholarly publications about charisma published in a religious context.\n\nThere's something deep within you.\n\n## The Connection That Transforms\n\nOne of my patients described it to me after his seventh suicide attempt. I asked, \"Should I be worried about you committing suicide?\" He said, \"No, you don't have to worry about me.\" I asked, \"Why the \\_\\_\\_ not? You've tried seven times.\"\n\nThis is what he told me: he was lying on a stretcher in the hospital that seventh time and realized he had tried to kill himself seven times, **but there is something within him that strives to live more than he strives to die**. He found that connection, even though he struggled with depression. The neuronal patterns, emotional patterns, cognitive patterns, traumas—all that in the brain and mind were still there. But something deep down was incredibly powerful. That's what you connect to.\n\nOnce you find that connection, you are transformed. There's a stability. It feels like the rest of the world is a tornado, and you're sitting in the **eye of the storm**.\n\nIn Eastern religious and contemplative traditions, they talk about a systematic way to find this—things like Shunya meditation. In my guide to meditation, we talk about some of this on the membership side, these weird esoteric, advanced techniques. There are ways to potentially find that connection, connect to the divinity within.\n\nOnce you connect to that divinity within, the empathic circuits of people around you get really confused because you don't respond. You've experienced and lived through the hardest form of isolation, abandonment, loneliness. You're still alive on the other side. Life threw the worst possible things at you, and you survived. That means you have a stability that comes because the only way you could survive was by connecting to the divine.\n\nAnd when you connect to the divine, other people pick up on it.\n\n## This Is How Cults Are Born\n\nThis is also how cults are born.\n\nThere are human beings on the planet who have this connection but don't have ethical training, didn't come up in a religious tradition, have egos that haven't been worked on. **You don't have to work on your ego to have this divine connection.** When that happens, cult leaders are born.\n\nHuman beings have true aura. Others gravitate toward them because they can detect: \"Holy \\_\\_\\_, this person has a stability I long for. I'm lonely, hopeless, sad. There's a deep hurt inside me, and this person seems to have healed it.\" They're drawn like moths to a flame.\n\nThe problem is that this person—just because they have a connection to the divine—can still have an ego out of control. I try to get scientific here, to understand the quantifiable phenomenological elements. Can you have a connection to the divine while still having an ego? Yes. Does that fix the deep hurt? No.\n\nThe neurological and psychiatric stuff is \"up here.\" The divine stuff is \"down below.\" That's why if you have a mental illness, we can fix it by working on the stuff up here with CBT, medications, etc. That doesn't give you the connection to the divine. Both can exist in parallel.\n\nSince they're egotistical, they fall into the traps of cults. They get paranoid, afraid, addicted to power. That spark of the divine is there, but all the mental stuff is still on top. That's where a cult comes from.\n\n## The Changes and the Dangers\n\nOnce you discover this true aura, a lot changes. If you go down the wrong route, you'll end up a cult leader. But I think there are things about you that will be different. If you've met someone with true aura, you may get this.\n\nFirst, these people tend to get **ick resistance**. The rest of the world is sensitive to ick: \"I don't want to hang out with losers. I'm going to chase clout. I want VIP treatment.\" There's the icky people down there and the strong people up here. The majority of people I've encountered with aura have immense ick resistance because all that social crap doesn't matter once you're connected to the divinity within. You see it as the weird drama of people trapped in their own egos, trying to get ahead.\n\nWith ick resistance comes **compassion**. If you pay attention, people who have ick lack compassion. These two cannot coexist. Ick is when I reject a person and can't see the fundamental good human being underneath. That's the person I should have compassion for. This person may evoke the ick, but imagine their life. If they evoke ick in everyone, they must be so lonely.\n\nThis sense of compassion comes in Eastern traditions. We say each of us has a spark of divinity. One way to develop compassion is to recognize every person has that spark. All the ick you see is just crud on the surface. It's like a diamond at the bottom of the ocean, covered in junk. If we clean it off, there is divinity within.\n\n## A Final Warning: Don't Go Looking For It\n\nI'm going to be honest. I think this is where real aura comes from: a failure of all your emotional, intellectual, and social defense mechanisms that keep you intact.\n\n**But I highly recommend you do not go looking for it.**\n\nEven if you're listening and thinking, \"How do I find this? I want this.\" That's tricky because your *wanting* comes from your ego. Going back to the Dark Night of the Soul, a key part is the dissolution of that ego. If you're hungry for it, that's not going to work.\n\nIf you're hungry for it, you're trying to be great. But people with true aura are not \"great.\" They may be measured as great from the outside, but that's not what they strive for or feel within. They simply *are*.\n\nThere's evidence around psychedelics and ego death that correlates with this. We have some science to back it up. But I'd say: don't go chasing this.\n\nA lot of you may say, \"But Dr. K, I've worked with very depressed, suicidal people. Haven't they hit rock bottom?\" Not really. I hate to say it, but very depressed and suicidal people are almost moving in the *wrong* direction. They still have psychological defense mechanisms that keep them from rock bottom. For many, depression, anxiety, negative emotions are strong protective mechanisms the brain has evolved. They're pathological—not always balanced or good for you.\n\nI've worked with suicidal people suffering immensely. I don't have all the answers, but it feels different.\n\nIf you long for true aura, be careful. I wouldn't recommend finding this. On one hand, it's transformative and great. On the other, I'm not sure it's worth that moment. What really scares me is I've worked with people who long for that moment, who are tired of their lives being ground down into nothing, who long to break or be reborn. They want to go all-in on life.\n\n**I strongly would not recommend it.**\n\nWhat I think is way better is going back to what we talked about originally: life has bad stuff and good stuff. Spend your time trying to build up as much good stuff as you can and reduce as much bad stuff as you can. That's the best way to live life because if finding true aura is in your destiny, it's going to happen to you anyway.",
