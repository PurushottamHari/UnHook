      "string": "Indian security agencies uncovered a terror module linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed, involving highly educated individuals. The investigation began after posters were found in Shopia, Kashmir, leading to the arrest of Irfan Ahmad. This revealed a network including doctors Adil Rather, Muzammil, and Shahin Siddiqui, who were allegedly radicalized and involved in planning attacks. Authorities recovered 2900 kg of ammonium nitrate explosives, an AK-47, and made around 80 arrests. The suspects used encrypted platforms for communication and were motivated by Pakistan-based handlers. The case highlights the threat of ideologically driven, educated recruits within India."

      "markdown_string": "# Red Fort Conspiracy: Educated Terror Module Busted\n\nIn a shocking revelation, Indian security agencies have dismantled a highly educated terror module with links to Pakistan-based militant organizations. The investigation, which began in October 2024, has exposed a sophisticated network of medical professionals and clerics involved in planning large-scale attacks across India.\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\n**October 19, 2024:** The investigation began in Shopian's Nowgam area where Jaish-e-Mohammed posters were found, calling for recruitment to \"destroy India together.\" The posters were traced to Irfan Ahmad Bagh, a Kashmiri Imam who was immediately arrested.\n\n**Early November:** During interrogation, Irfan Ahmad revealed his wife was in contact with Dr. Shaeen, who was later arrested from Lucknow. The network extended to Sadiya, sister of Masood Azhar, whose husband was the mastermind of the IC-814 Kandhar hijacking and was killed during Operation Sindoor.\n\n**November 5:** Dr. Adil Rather was arrested from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. When brought to Srinagar for interrogation, he initially refused to cooperate and began singing songs instead of answering questions.\n\n**November 8:** Jammu and Kashmir Police with Haryana Police support arrested Dr. Shari Shakeel from Al Falah University. An AK-47 was recovered from Dr. Adil's locker at GMC Anantnag where he practiced medicine.\n\n**November 9:** Intensive interrogation of three arrested individuals led to the recovery of 2,900 kg of ammonium nitrate explosives from Dr. Shakeel's rented room in Faridabad.\n\n**November 10:** Dr. Omar Nabi, the prime suspect in the Delhi blast case, died in a Hyundai i20 explosion. Authorities confirm it wasn't a suicide attack but occurred when he panicked and the vehicle exploded.\n\n## The Key Players\n\n**Dr. Omar Nabi:**\n- MBBS graduate from 2017\n- Described as \"rude and ill-mannered\" by colleagues\n- Accused of causing a patient's death in Kashmir\n- Had disappeared after the incident and joined Al Falah School of Medical Sciences in Faridabad in 2023\n- Prime suspect in Delhi blast case\n\n**Dr. Adil Rather:**\n- MBBS and MD from GMC Anantnag\n- Practicing doctor until October 2024\n- Also worked at a private hospital in Saharanpur\n- AK-47 recovered from his medical college locker\n\n**Dr. Shaeen Siddiqui:**\n- UPSC qualified\n- Medical college lecturer from Lucknow's Lalbagh area\n- Described as \"quiet, intelligent, and disciplined\"\n- Personally connected to Sadiya Azhar\n- Responsible for establishing Jaish-e-Mohammed's women's wing in India\n- Used her Swift Dzire car to transport weapons and explosives\n\n## Modus Operandi\n\nThe terror module operated through:\n- Highly encrypted online platforms for communication\n- Radicalization and recruitment of educated individuals\n- Financial and logistical facilitation\n- Use of rented accommodations across multiple states\n- Direct coordination with Pakistan-based handlers\n\n## Investigation Breakthroughs\n\nSecurity agencies have made approximately 80 arrests in the past month following intensive investigation. Key developments include:\n\n- Arrest of six individuals from Pulwama including Tariq Aamir (who provided SIM cards), Omar Rashid (Aamir's brother), Ghulam Nabi (Dr. Omar's father), Dr. Sajjad Malla (Dr. Omar's friend), and Shameema Begum (who assisted with DNA testing)\n- Recovery of digital devices, mobile phones, hard disks, and documents from multiple locations\n- Arrest of Dr. Shaeen's younger brother Dr. Parvez Ansari\n- Ongoing interrogation of family members\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nThis case reveals a dangerous trend of educated individuals being radicalized. As the investigator notes: \"This is a new educated extremist network. When highly qualified people spread jihad, you can understand how dangerous this network is.\"\n\nThe module had specific responsibilities:\n- Dr. Shaeen: Establishing women's terror wing\n- Dr. Omar: Executing operations\n- Dr. Adil: Logistics and coordination\n\n## Appeal to Community\n\nThe investigation highlights the urgent need for community involvement in countering radicalization. As emphasized in the briefing: \"This is Pakistan's strategy to create Hindu-Muslim riots in India. The biggest role in preventing this belongs to Muslim leaders, Imams, and scholars to guide those who might be going astray.\"\n\nThe security apparatus has intensified scrutiny of educational institutions and sensitive locations, with increased CCTV surveillance and intelligence gathering to prevent such modules from operating undetected.\n\n*The investigation continues as security agencies work to completely dismantle this sophisticated terror network and prevent future radicalization of educated youth.*",
