      "string": "The Delhi car blast near the Red Fort is now being investigated as a possible accidental or panic-induced explosion, not a fully planned suicide attack. Key findings indicate the bomb was not fully developed, lacking components like shrapnel, and the damage was primarily from fire rather than a high-intensity blast. Separately, India has strongly rejected Pakistan's baseless allegations linking India to a recent blast in Islamabad, calling it a predictable tactic without evidence. The investigation into the Delhi incident continues, with arrests made and explosives recovered in Faridabad, suggesting a larger terror plot may have been disrupted."

      "markdown_string": "# Delhi Car Blast Investigation and India-Pakistan Tensions: Key Developments\n\n## The Delhi Car Blast: A Shift in Perspective\n\nThe investigation into the Delhi car blast near the Red Fort has taken a significant turn, with authorities now suggesting the explosive device may not have been fully developed when it detonated. Initial assumptions pointed toward a meticulously planned, large-scale suicide attack, but emerging forensic and technical findings indicate a different scenario.\n\n### The Incident Timeline\n\nOn the 10th of the month, a Hyundai i20 car with Gurugram registration HR 26 traveled from Faridabad, entered Delhi via the Badarpur border, and parked near the Red Fort around 3:30 PM. The vehicle remained there for approximately two and a half hours before departing after 6:30 PM. It proceeded toward Chandni Chowk Road, opposite the Red Fort's main entrance, near the iconic red Jain Temple. As the car slowed near a traffic signal, it exploded, resulting in at least 12-13 fatalities.\n\nSecurity agencies—including Delhi Police's Special Cell and the National Investigation Agency—are investigating under anti-terror laws, given the location's symbolic significance and the timing in a crowded area.\n\n### Key Investigative Findings\n\n1. **Lack of Crater Formation**: High-intensity explosives typically create a depression or crater at the blast site. Investigators noted no such crater, suggesting the device may not have been as powerful as initially assumed.\n\n2. **Burn Injuries Dominant**: Most injuries and damage resulted from fires igniting nearby vehicles—common in crowded, evening settings—rather than from the blast's direct impact. This contrasts with typical explosion patterns.\n\n3. **Incomplete Bomb Assembly**: The device lacked sharp, shrapnel-like objects (e.g., ball bearings) often included to maximize casualties. The detonator and trigger mechanism were improperly connected, indicating the device was unstable and not fully assembled.\n\n### Possible \"Panic Trigger\" Theory\n\nInvestigators are exploring whether the attacker, identified as Umar Un Nabi, may have triggered the device prematurely out of panic. This theory gains traction given:\n\n- **Prior Raids in Faridabad**: Security agencies had previously recovered explosives—initially misreported as 350 kg of RDX but later confirmed as ammonium nitrate—disrupting a larger, multi-state terror network.\n- **Lack of Secondary Blasts**: Coordinated terror attacks often involve sequential explosions; none occurred here, possibly due to preemptive seizures.\n- **Attacker's Profile**: Media visits to Nabi's family in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, revealed shock and disbelief, with relatives describing him as religiously oriented and a passionate cricketer who had moved to Delhi the previous year.\n\n## Pakistan's Accusations and India's Response\n\nIn a separate development, a suicide bombing occurred outside a court in Islamabad, Pakistan, killing at least 12 people. Initial reports suggested the attack was carried out by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a splinter group of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif swiftly accused India of involvement, tweeting allegations without presenting verified evidence. India's Ministry of External Affairs firmly rejected these claims, labeling them \"baseless\" and \"unfounded.\" Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated that Pakistan's \"predictable tactic\" of blaming India without proof has cost it credibility, and the international community is aware of the reality.\n\nIndia maintains it will not officially attribute blame in the Delhi blast until conclusive evidence is established—a stance reflecting responsible governance, contrasting with Pakistan's immediate, unsubstantiated allegations.\n\n## Conclusion: A Narrowly Averted Larger Plot?\n\nThe Delhi blast investigation reveals a potentially disrupted larger conspiracy, given the significant quantities of explosives seized in Faridabad (including 2900 kg of ammonium nitrate, timers, and weapons). The attacker may have acted in panic amid heightened security operations. While forensic analysis continues, the incident underscores the importance of vigilance and thorough investigation in combating terrorism.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: This article is based on available reports and ongoing investigations. Further updates will follow as official information is released.",
