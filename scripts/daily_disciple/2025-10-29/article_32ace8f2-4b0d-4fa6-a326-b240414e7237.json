      "string": "AI models like ChatGPT and Claude often fail to use their full advertised context capacity effectively, a problem known as 'context rot.' Research shows that reliable performance typically occurs at only 25-50% of the claimed token limits. This happens because AI samples from large contexts rather than processing everything, leading to shortcuts and reduced accuracy. To combat this, structure information using formats like markdown or JSON, break documents into focused chunks, and organize them in hierarchical systems. This approach, called context engineering, helps AI focus its attention and deliver more dependable results without overwhelming its processing capabilities."

      "markdown_string": "# Understanding AI Context Rot and How to Fix It\n\nIf you've ever uploaded multiple documents into ChatGPT, crafted detailed prompts, and added tons of project files—all to give the AI as much context as possible—only to find it still misses the most important details, you're not alone. Many users assume the solution is better instructions or even more context. But after weeks of testing, I've discovered this is a **systemic, widespread issue** affecting nearly all major language models.\n\nIn the next few minutes, we’ll explore the research that reveals the real performance limits of AI—and I’ll walk you through the approach I’ve developed to work *with* these limitations rather than against them.\n\n---\n\n## The Reality Behind Those Impressive Context Windows\n\nAI companies love to promote massive context windows: 200,000 tokens, 1 million tokens, and beyond. But a recent study of 18 leading LLMs tested their performance across different context lengths—and the results tell a story that’s very different from the marketing materials.\n\nWhen models like ChatGPT and Claude promise 200,000 tokens, the **effective context window**—where you get reliable, consistent results—is actually closer to **between 50,000 and 100,000 tokens**. In other words, you’re getting somewhere between **25% and 50%** of the advertised capacity in terms of dependable performance.\n\nThis gap between advertised capacity and real-world reliability isn’t just a minor inconvenience—it’s a fundamental limitation that already has a name: **context rot**.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Context Rot—and Why Does It Happen?\n\nContext rot isn’t necessarily deceptive marketing. These systems *can* technically handle larger contexts, but whether they handle them *well* is a different question entirely.\n\nHere’s what’s fascinating about this problem: it reveals something fundamental about how AI processes information.\n\nWe tend to think of AI as reading our entire context the way a human would—carefully, from beginning to end, memorizing everything along the way. But that’s not how it works.\n\nIn reality, AI **samples** from your context, focusing its attention on the parts that seem relevant to your query. As the context grows larger, the sampling becomes less precise. Why? Because every LLM operates within a **budget**—of time, electricity, server capacity, and tokens. Processing a large amount of context requires significant resources, and when the system is overwhelmed, it takes shortcuts.\n\n---\n\n## The Wrong Way to Solve Context Rot\n\nMost people who discover context rot try to solve it by:\n\n- Writing better prompts\n- Switching to different AI models\n\nBut these approaches only address the *symptoms*, not the cause.\n\nThe real solution isn’t changing how you *talk* to AI—it’s about changing how you *prepare information* before giving it to the AI.\n\n---\n\n## A Better Approach: Three Techniques That Work\n\n### 1. Use Structured Formats, Not Plain Text\n\nInstead of copying and pasting plain text, use formats like **Markdown** or **JSON**. These are closer to an LLM’s “native language,” meaning the AI can process and absorb the text much more efficiently.\n\nYou can even have an LLM convert text into these formats for you—just ask:\n\n> “Convert this into Markdown format so it’s easy for an LLM to parse.”\n\nOn the flip side, **avoid formats that are difficult for LLMs to understand**, such as PDFs, which require a tremendous amount of processing power to absorb effectively.\n\n### 2. Break Large Documents Into Focused Chunks\n\nInstead of using one gigantic document with all your company’s information, break it down into **focused, purposeful, clearly labeled chunks**.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A separate document for finance\n- Another for product development\n- Another for HR and compensation\n\nThen, when you ask the LLM a question, **only load the documents relevant to that specific query**. If you have a question about taxes, load the finance doc—not the product doc. If you’re asking about team compensation, you don’t need the strategy doc.\n\n### 3. Organize Documents in an Overarching System\n\nTo manage these documents effectively, use a clear, consistent hierarchy. I use my **PARA method**—a simple system that organizes information across both work and life. (My book, *The PARA Method*, has sold over 30,000 copies worldwide and is available wherever books are sold.)\n\nHere’s how it works in practice:\n\nIn our company’s shared Google Drive, we’ve broken down the entire business into different parts:\n\n- **Strategic Planning**: Goal setting, metrics, long-term vision\n- **Enabling Processes**: HR, finance, and other ongoing operations\n- **Core Processes**: The core ways we deliver value to customers\n\nDrilling down further, core processes are divided into six stages:\n\n1. Creating content in the market → Generating leads  \n2. Leads → Making sales  \n3. Sales → Delivering services and training  \n4. Delivery → Ensuring customer success  \n5. Success → Generating word-of-mouth leads  \n6. Success → Repurposing case studies and testimonials into content\n\nIf I click into “Delivery to Success,” I reach the level of documents that can be loaded into an LLM as project files:\n\n- **Level 1**: Big-picture view of “Delivery to Success”\n- **Level 2**: Blueprint—steps, measurements, and verification\n- **Level 3**: Step-by-step guides for accomplishing tasks\n- **Level 4**: Tools—templates and other resources\n\nBy breaking our entire business into **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**, I can give the AI *just the document it needs*—not a tens-of-thousands-of-word monstrosity.\n\nAt the top level of our Google Drive, the entire business is organized using the PARA framework:\n\n- **Projects** (e.g., Forte Labs active projects)\n- **Areas** (e.g., finance, marketing, operations)\n- **Resources** (e.g., email templates, support docs, transcripts)\n- **Archives** (e.g., old projects, inactive processes)\n\nThis system ensures that anyone—internal team members or external collaborators—can quickly find what they need without clutter.\n\n---\n\n## The Big Picture: Context Engineering\n\nThe key insight here is that **AI works best when it can focus its attention**—just like humans. But to focus, AI needs something completely different from what humans need: **highly structured data formats**.\n\nInstead of fighting this limitation, we can design our approach around it. Knowing about context rot is only the beginning. The true solution lies in a whole emerging discipline called **context engineering**.\n\nI’ve shared a few initial tips here to get you started, but if you want the full picture, I encourage you to check out my next video, where I walk through the **five levels of context** that transform AI into a reliable thinking partner.\n\nIn the meantime, remember: less is often more. Give the AI only what it needs—structured, focused, and purposeful—and you’ll get far better results.\n\n---\n\n*If you’d like to learn more about the PARA method, I have a complete video series available—you can find it in the playlist linked here.
