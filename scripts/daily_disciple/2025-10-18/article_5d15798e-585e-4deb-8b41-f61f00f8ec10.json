      "string": "Siddhant Agnihotri discusses the urgent need for judicial reform in India, highlighting severe delays with over 5 crore pending cases. Victims often die before justice is served, and undertrials languish in jail due to poverty. Key solutions proposed include improving judicial efficiency by filling vacancies, running courts in double shifts, increasing budget allocation beyond the current 0.2%, and implementing strict case timelines. He emphasizes that strengthening the rule of law is crucial for investment, quality of life, and ensuring citizens' fundamental rights to justice, making judicial reform a national priority."

      "markdown_string": "# Reforming India's Judicial System for Timely Justice\n\n## The Scale of the Problem\n\nIndia’s judiciary is one of the most respected in the world—there is no doubt about that. But the reality on the ground tells a different story. Justice is often delayed, sometimes for decades. If you file a simple land dispute case, it could easily take 10 to 15 years to resolve. In cases of heinous crimes like rape, victims or their families often wait so long that the accused may die before a verdict is reached—or worse, they may abscond entirely.\n\nWe all know the law moves slowly here. While it’s crucial to protect the innocent from wrongful punishment, this very caution often forces victims to endure a long, painful journey through the courts.\n\n## The Numbers Don’t Lie\n\nThere are currently around **5 crore (50 million) pending cases** in Indian courts. To put that in perspective—counting them one by one would take months. We often hear that India is among the top five global economies, but what does that mean if the justice system remains overburdened and inaccessible?\n\nIn the **Rule of Law Index**, India ranks **79th**. This isn’t just a statistic—it reflects the daily struggles of ordinary citizens. People don’t know where to turn. There’s no unified system to address grievances. In the U.S., for example, local issues go to the mayor. Here, if there’s a problem with a small road, you go to the MCD; for a bigger road, the PWD; for a highway, the NHAI. This fragmentation is designed to exhaust the common person.\n\n## Justice Delayed is Justice Denied\n\n- In the **Supreme Court**, cases have been pending since **1st July 2006**.\n- In the **High Courts**, there are lakhs of pending cases.\n- In **lower courts**, the numbers run into crores.\n\nThe backlog is not just large—it’s **growing**. And the human cost is staggering.\n\nTake the **CBI’s anti-corruption branch data from 1980–84**: out of 275 accused, only 144 could be convicted. The average trial took **over 7 years**. In high-profile cases like that of **Baba Ram Rahim**, the accused received parole repeatedly—spending more time outside than inside.\n\nThere are even cases where an accused, out on bail, committed another murder—daring the system to “take the case back.” This is the level of impunity we’re dealing with.\n\n## Victims Suffer, System Fails\n\nLook at the **Sanjay Roy medical case** (RG medical case). The victim died a painful death after a brutal assault. Yet, the four convicts spent only **20 days in jail** before getting bail. Of the 71 related cases, many are still under appeal. The victims’ families wait endlessly—their lives on hold.\n\nThis isn’t just delay—it’s **injustice**. Our society is suffering from this systemic failure.\n\n## Under-Trial Prisoners: A National Shame\n\nIn **2021**, about **77% of prisoners in India—nearly 5.5 lakh people—were under trials**. Many are so poor they can’t afford bail. Their **Right to Liberty (Article 21)** is being violated every day they remain behind bars without a verdict.\n\n## Criminalization in Politics\n\nAround **40% of Indian politicians face criminal charges**. While it’s true that “innocent until proven guilty” is a legal principle, the public often perceives politicians with cases as guilty. Yet, we continue to elect them. This moral and legal contradiction weakens public trust in both the political and judicial systems.\n\n## Do We Need More Judges?\n\nIn **2002**, the Supreme Court recommended **50 judges per 10 lakh people**. Former Chief Justice of India **TS Thakur** said in **2017** that India needs at least **70,000 judges** to function efficiently. Currently, we have only about **23,000**.\n\nBut simply tripling the number of judges may not be the only solution.\n\n## Efficiency Over Expansion\n\nA **12-year analysis of Supreme Court data** shows that the **rate of case disposal** is modest:\n- **6% in subordinate courts**\n- **8% in High Courts**\n- **11% in the Supreme Court**\n\nThe key takeaway: **backlog can be reduced without doubling judges**—if we improve efficiency.\n\n## Practical Reforms\n\n### 1. Fill Existing Vacancies Immediately\nThere are thousands of vacant judicial posts. Fill them—don’t wait.\n\n### 2. Two-Shift Court Operation\nAbout **5,000 courts** can operate in **two shifts**. If one shift isn’t enough, run courts at night. Why not?\n\n### 3. Reduce Holidays and Strikes\nFrequent court closures—public holidays, strikes—delay justice for years. One friend’s divorce case has been pending for three years, with hearings repeatedly postponed due to closures.\n\n### 4. Increase Budget Allocation\nOnly **0.2% of the national budget** is allocated to the judiciary. How can the system function without adequate funding? Increasing expenditure to even **1%** could bring transformative change.\n\n### 5. Advance Planning for Appointments\nThe **collegium system** should recommend judges **three months before retirement**. The same advance planning should apply to subordinate judges.\n\n### 6. Permanent Judicial Secretariat\nEstablish a **permanent judicial selection secretariat** to streamline appointments. If needed, conduct a judicial service exam to ensure a steady pipeline of qualified judges.\n\n## Why Judicial Reform is a National Priority\n\n**Rule of Law** is the foundation of a functioning democracy. It affects everything:\n- Investment climate\n- Ease of doing business\n- Quality of life\n- Public safety\n\nWithout it, society descends into chaos. Citizens’ **fundamental rights** are meaningless if they can’t access justice.\n\n## A Call for Time-Bound Justice\n\nWe must replace the **“law of the jungle”** with the **“law of justice.”**\n- Set a clear timeline: **dispose of 90% of cases within six months**.\n- Hold officials accountable—impose consequences if deadlines aren’t met.\n\nThis will ensure **speedy justice** while preserving the right to appeal.\n\n---\n\n**What do you think?**  \nShare your views in the comment section.
