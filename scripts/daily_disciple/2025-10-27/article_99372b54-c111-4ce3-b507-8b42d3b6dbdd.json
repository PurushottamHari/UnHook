      "string": "India's banking sector is experiencing a significant surge in foreign investment, marking the largest wave of international interest since the 2008 financial crisis. Recent deals include Emirates NBD's planned 25% stake in RBL Bank and SMBC's investment in Yes Bank. This trend is driven by India's robust economic recovery, strong GDP growth, declining NPAs, and regulatory confidence in the RBI. While benefits include capital infusion, technology transfer, and improved governance, challenges such as regulatory limits, national security risks, and potential capital flight exist. The government is considering reforms, including raising foreign investment caps in public sector banks to attract more global capital and strengthen India's position as a financial hub."

Government & RBI Policy Shifts\n- The Finance Ministry is evaluating a proposal to **raise the foreign investment cap** in Public Sector Banks (PSBs) from **20% to 49%**.\n- RBI is adopting a **softer stance** on long-term foreign capital to attract strategic investment.\n- Moves like the proposed **IDBI Bank stake sale** and efforts to bring global investors into other PSBs indicate a **privatization momentum**.\n\n### 4.
