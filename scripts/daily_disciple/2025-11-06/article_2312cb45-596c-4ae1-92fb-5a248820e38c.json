And right now we're at a remarkable time in the history of NASA where people want to cut the budget for science just about in half.\n\n**Bill Nye:** And whose problem is that? Everybody's problem.\n\nThe conversation quickly turned to Casey Dreier, Chief of Space Policy for The Planetary Society, whom Nye introduced as \"among the world's foremost authorities on NASA budgets and NASA budget policy.\"\n\n**Casey Dreier:** It's real bad. I think that's actually the most objective and kindest way I can put it. You're looking at NASA being proposed to be cut by 25%. That's the largest single amount of cut ever in NASA's history.\n\nWhen Nye asked how this compared to the post-Apollo contraction, Dreier delivered a sobering comparison:\n\n**Dreier:** It's bigger than it was during like after Apollo. We're cutting NASA by more than we ramped down NASA after we ended the moon program.\n\n**Nye:** So instead of ending a moon program, we're nominally starting one up.\n\n**Dreier:** That's the opposite. It's like falling off a cliff.\n\n## The Disproportionate Impact on Science\n\nThe most alarming aspect? Half of these massive cuts are directed at science missions.\n\n**Dreier:** Of that big cut, half is directed at science.\n\nNye clarified for listeners: \"We have to distinguish between human space flight and what would be called scientific exploration.\"\n\n**Dreier:** NASA science is anything motivated by science that doesn't have humans involved in the process in space. Things like space telescopes like Hubble, Mars rovers, New Horizons, Earth observation satellites.\n\n### Earth Science: The Hardest Hit\n\n**Dreier:** It would cut Earth science by more than half.\n\nNye pressed for clarification: \"For me, what is Earth science?\"\n\n**Dreier:** This is when you put a science mission up in space and you just point it back down. You're observing things like water distributions, gravity anomalies on Earth, weather, large-scale climate, carbon monitoring—all the things that give us the sense of how our dynamic planet evolves.\n\n**Nye:** I'm going to go out on a limb and say that that sounds a little important.\n\n**Dreier:** It's very relevant to most people.\n\nNye connected this to broader scientific questions: \"The big questions we ask: where we come from, but are we alone in the cosmos? When we look at Earth, we're wondering what it takes to have living things. We only have one example of a place with living things. By studying Earth now, we have something to compare everything else we find to.\"\n\n### The Climate Change Connection\n\nThe discussion inevitably turned to the political dimensions of these cuts.\n\n**Nye:** How much of that has to do with climate change disinterest, uninterest?\n\n**Dreier:** Substantial, I think. Ironically, what was originally called the Mission to Planet Earth—this expansion of NASA observation of Earth—started under the last years of the Reagan administration and George H.W. Bush under two Republican presidents.\n\n**Nye:** [Sarcastically] Those woke bastards. You kidding me? Reagan, man. God, what a lib tart he was.\n\nDreier noted the historical foundation: \"NASA's original 1958 act passed by Congress listed out the statutory responsibilities of the space program. One of which is to observe phenomena in the atmosphere and space.\"\n\n**Nye:** When the second letter is aeronautics, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. If you're going to study aeronautics, you presume you would have some interest in the atmosphere. We put the air in aeronautics.\n\n## The Mars Sample Return Crisis\n\nThe conversation took a dramatic turn when discussing one of NASA's most ambitious projects: bringing Martian samples back to Earth.\n\n**Dreier:** Just last week, a paper came out about a rock on Mars that the Perseverance rover studied. They call it a potential biosignature—the most promising potential biosignature sign.\n\nNye leaned in: \"What makes it promising?\"\n\n**Dreier:** They found organic traces—carbon compounds, the building blocks of life—overlaid with various shapes and patterns in the rock that on Earth are always made by biological systems. If we had found this rock on Earth, we'd say bacteria made this.\n\nThe kicker? **We have a sample of this thing** that could answer whether life existed on Mars.\n\n**Dreier:** We have a piece of rock on Mars that we could bring back and say, 'Was this life?' It's in a tube ready to go.\n\n**Nye:** And the White House budget canceled the effort to bring back those samples.\n\n### The Human Contamination Problem\n\nNye explained why sending humans instead of robots won't solve the problem:\n\n**Nye:** If you send people, you're going to contaminate it. Every astronaut spacesuit leaks. We're walking bags of bacteria and viruses. When we send robots, we bake them at 500° for 3 weeks to kill everything. You can't bake an astronaut at 500°.\n\n**Dreier:** At no point in history ever has adding humans to a space mission made it cheaper or happen faster.\n\n## The Geopolitical Stakes\n\nThe discussion turned to international competition, particularly with China.\n\n**Dreier:** The China National Space Administration is doing all these missions that are almost one for one. They actually have a Mars sample return mission going in 2028.\n\nNye invoked a \"wise leader\" who said, \"We invent all of this and then we don't have it. It's not here. China's killing us. They're killing us.\"\n\n**Dreier:** Even if you don't buy the China competition, it is the framing of the administration right now that there is a new space race with China. There's just a hearing in Congress framing it literally that way. So it doesn't make sense that in order to win a space race, they cut our science budget at NASA in half.\n\n## Putting NASA's Budget in Perspective\n\nDreier provided crucial context about NASA's actual budget size:\n\n**Dreier:** NASA is just this tiny, tiny fraction. Less than a half of a percent of the federal budget. Of NASA, roughly a third goes to science. So you're talking about a third of less than half a percent—0.1% of every tax dollar. We spend more money on pet food in this country than we do on sending things into space for scientific reasons.\n\n**Nye:** Dogs got to eat, man.\n\n**Dreier:** We can afford this.\n\n## Why Space Science Matters Beyond \"Wasteful Spending\"\n\nNye addressed the common criticism head-on: \"There are people who will hear what you just said and then say, 'But so what? What's that got to do with me? How does cutting the budget leave more money for the rest of our important things?'\"\n\nDreier responded with both practical and philosophical arguments:\n\n**Dreier:** There's practical reasons why we do space. By understanding other planets, we've learned how unique and rare our planet is. You look at Venus and Mars right next to us—those are your two worst-case scenarios. Global warming was actually an idea spurred by observations of Venus.\n\nHe continued: \"By going out and looking at these things, we're surprised about what can actually happen. Things like dark energy—these things about what we don't know surprises us by definition. It's that surprise that pushes us to modify and improve our understanding of the systems in which we inhabit as humans.\"\n\n**Nye added the philosophical dimension:** \"Do we want to be people who are looking forward to new things or do we kind of hunch over and just swipe on TikTok for the rest of our existence as a society?\"\n\n## The Historical Precedent and What's at Stake\n\nDreier provided crucial historical context:\n\n**Dreier:** In the United States, we didn't have public funding of science basically until after World War II because science and technology turned out to be so valuable in winning a war. Before that, it was private sector responsibility. But when you start doing really complex things like going into space, it's hard for any one person to do that.\n\nHe described the limitations of private funding, using the example of early telescope builders: \"They'd cut the ribbon, say 'I'm such a great person, I've built this thing for the benefit of humanity,' and take off—and never fund anyone to actually look through it. That's the difference. Our brains like to focus on a physical thing, but the ongoing activity of something is really hard for a person to take a lot of attention to.\"\n\n## What You Can Do\n\nThe conversation ended with a call to action.\n\n**Nye:** If you can incentivize your representative to fund NASA, NASA will be funded. When you reach out to the people that you vote for and tell them, \"Hey, man, you better do this,\" they actually do take note because quiet as it's kept, we're the boss.\n\n**Dreier pointed to specific resources:** \"Planetary.org—there's links right on the homepage for our Save NASA Science campaign. It'll catch you up on the news, give you ways to write your member of Congress. We go to Congress every year, sometimes twice a year.\"\n\nHe emphasized the nonpartisan nature of the effort: \"This is political but nonpartisan. Congress has largely agreed with us on all the things I've just said. It really speaks to that this is not something to completely despair over.\"\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nNye ended with a powerful reflection on scientific progress:\n\n**Nye:** All four of my grandparents were born in the 1800s. They did not know there were neutrons. They did not know there was relativity. They did not know that one day we would have mobile phones that depend on both special relativity and general relativity. All of that is derived from space exploration.\n\n**Dreier added the emotional and philosophical stakes:** \"This isn't just about specific missions. This is an access to the sublime that we do not get from pretty much anything else in a secular world today. There's something bigger and grander just waiting—literally sitting on the surface of Mars waiting to be known.\"\n\nAs Nye signed off with his trademark \"Keep looking up,\" the message was clear: the choice isn't just about budgets, but about what kind of future we want to build—one that looks outward with curiosity and ambition, or one that turns inward.\n\n---\n\n*Listen to the full conversation on Star Talk and learn how to take action at planetary.org/saveNASAscience.*",
