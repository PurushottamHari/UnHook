      "markdown_string": "# Ancient Philosophies of Pleasure and Character: A Journey Through Greco-Roman Thought\n\n## Introduction: The Return of a Modern Philosopher\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome. We welcome today the return of Professor Massimo Pigliucci, the K.D. Irani Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York, back by popular demand.\n\nRaised in Rome, Italy, Professor Pigliucci's academic journey is as fascinating as it is diverse. He received a doctorate in genetics from the University of Ferrara, holds a PhD in evolutionary biology from the University of Connecticut, and a PhD in philosophy from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His distinguished career includes recognition as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his major contributions to studies of gene-environment interactions and his educational efforts to counter widespread pseudoscientific beliefs.\n\nIn 1997, he was awarded the prestigious Dobzhansky Prize from the Society for the Study of Evolution. As a public intellectual, Pigliucci has written regularly for Skeptical Inquirer on topics such as climate change denial and intelligent design, and has contributed to publications including the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. His media appearances span PBS, BBC, NBC News, and many other major outlets.\n\nWith over 170 technical papers in science and philosophy and 16 books to his name—including the best-selling *How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life*—Pigliucci brings both depth and accessibility to ancient wisdom. His most recent work, *Beyond Stoicism: A Guide to the Good Life with Stoics, Skeptics, Epicureans, and Other Ancient Philosophers*, published this past January, forms the foundation for today's exploration.\n\n## The Axial Age: When Wisdom Awakened\n\n\"What I wanted to talk to you today and next time,\" Pigliucci begins, \"is a really broad panorama of ancient Greco-Roman philosophies.\" While his previous talks focused on Stoicism—the philosophy he personally practices—he emphasizes that \"the Greco-Roman philosophical world was much broader than Stoicism and connects even more so with other wisdom traditions throughout the Eurasian continent.\"\n\nHe situates this philosophical flowering within what philosopher Karl Jaspers termed the \"Axial Age\"—roughly 800 BCE to 200 BCE—when \"the Eurasian continent went through a series of transformations that is sometimes referred to as the axial age. Axial means value in Greek. So the age of value, the age when people started realizing that there were things that had value that were not the obvious kind of things.\"\n\nDuring this remarkable 600-year period, multiple wisdom traditions emerged simultaneously across Eurasia:\n- **Greece**: The archaic period and birth of Western philosophy\n- **India**: The origin of Hinduism and Buddhism\n- **China**: The rise of Confucianism\n- **Middle East**: The development of Abrahamic traditions\n\n\"This is not just about history,\" Pigliucci stresses. \"It's about the fact that the kinds of things these people were talking about and thinking about 2,500 years ago are in large part still with us today. If not their specific answers, their specific suggestions, certainly the kind of questions that they were asking.\"\n\n## The Three Ports: A New Way to Navigate Ancient Philosophy\n\nRather than approaching these philosophies chronologically, Pigliucci and his co-authors Greg Lopez and Meredith Kun developed what they call the \"three ports\" framework, using a nautical metaphor to organize these diverse schools of thought.\n\n\"There are three of these ports,\" he explains. \"**Pleasure, character or virtue, and doubt.** Today I'll talk about pleasure and character, and then next time we'll talk about doubt and something else that we called 'here be dragons'—ancient maps when people didn't know what was going on in a certain area of the world would label it 'here be dragons,' meaning this is treacherous territory.\"\n\n## Foundational Concepts: Telos and Eudaimonia\n\nBefore exploring the specific ports, Pigliucci introduces two fundamental Greek concepts essential to understanding ancient philosophy:\n\n**Telos** means purpose, end, or goal—\"where you want to end up.\"\n\n**Eudaimonia** is the ancient Greek word for what we might call happiness, but more precisely means \"a life worth living—the kind of life that you get to the end of and you look back and say, 'Yeah, that was not a waste of time.'\"\n\n\"For the Greeks,\" Pigliucci explains, \"the telos of a human life is eudaimonia. Eudaimonia is what is called an intrinsic good—a good for which it doesn't make any sense to ask why you want it.\" Unlike instrumental goods like money (which we want for what it can provide), eudaimonia is an end in itself.\n\n## Port 1: The Philosophy of Pleasure\n\n### The Cyrenaics: Ancient Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll\n\nThe first school in the port of pleasure comes from the Cyrenaics, named after the city of Cyrene in what is now Libya. Founded by Aristippus of Cyrene, this school represented what Pigliucci calls \"the original sex, drugs, and rock and roll philosophy of life.\"\n\nAristippus famously said: \"I possess Lais [a courtesan], but I am not possessed by her, since the best thing is to possess pleasures without being their slave, not to be devoid of pleasures.\"\n\nThe Cyrenaic approach to pleasure was strikingly focused:\n- **Physical over mental pleasures**: \"Physical pleasure is something that you can really sink your teeth in, so to speak. Mental pleasure is more remote, more sophisticated—but the Cyrenaics would say not quite as exciting.\"\n- **Present over past or future**: \"The only pleasure that really qualifies as pleasure for the Cyrenaic is physical pleasure here and now.\"\n\nPigliucci notes the philosophical sophistication behind this apparently simple approach: \"They ask interesting questions like, 'Why should I be concerned about my own future? Because I'm not living in the future, I'm living now. I don't even know if my future self will have the same priorities.'\"\n\nThis leads to a provocative question: \"Do you have a duty toward your future self? Why exactly? And how do you know what your future self wants?\" The Cyrenaics would answer no—we can only know and serve our present desires.\n\n### Epicureanism: The Sophisticated Pleasure Seekers\n\nThe second major hedonistic school, Epicureanism, founded by Epicurus of Samos, represented a more sophisticated approach to pleasure that essentially replaced Cyrenaicism.\n\n\"Epicureanism is much more sophisticated,\" Pigliucci explains, \"and sure enough, it replaced Cyrenaicism almost immediately. Unlike Cyrenaicism, Epicureanism lasted for centuries.\"\n\nThe foundation of Epicurean philosophy is the **tetrapharmakos**—the \"four-fold remedy\" for life's troubles:\n1. **Don't fear God** (gods exist but don't care about humans)\n2. **Don't worry about death** (\"Where death is, you are not. And where you are, death is not.\")\n3. **What is good is easy to get**\n4. **What is terrible is easy to endure**\n\nEpicureans developed a sophisticated classification of desires:\n\n| | Natural | Unnatural |\n|------|----------|------------|\n| **Necessary** | Food, shelter, friendship | Gourmet food, fancy wine |\n| **Unnecessary** | (Empty—can't be both natural and unnecessary) | Fame, wealth, power |\n\n\"The only desires you should concern yourself with,\" Pigliucci explains, \"are the natural and necessary ones. Those are the easy ones to satisfy.\"\n\nContrary to modern misconceptions, Epicureans were definitely not about \"sex, drugs, and rock and roll.\" In fact, \"the highest possible pleasure for an Epicurean was lack of pain—a condition they referred to as *aponia*.\" The ultimate goal was *ataraxia*—tranquility or serenity achieved through a life free from mental and physical pain.\n\nEpicurus himself demonstrated this philosophy on his deathbed: despite suffering from a painful stomach ailment, he wrote to a friend that he was having one of the happiest days of his life because he was deriving pleasure from memories of wonderful conversations.\n\n## Port 2: The Philosophy of Character\n\n### Aristotelianism: The Golden Mean\n\nThe first major virtue ethics school comes from Aristotle, who famously said: \"One swallow does not make a summer, nor does one day. And so too one day or a short time does not make a man blessed and happy.\"\n\nFor Aristotle, happiness isn't a momentary feeling but a long-term condition. His approach to virtue centers on the **golden mean**—virtue as the midpoint between deficiency and excess. For example:\n- **Courage** is the mean between cowardice (deficiency) and recklessness (excess)\n- **Generosity** is the mean between stinginess and wastefulness\n\n\"The virtues require wisdom,\" Pigliucci notes, \"the wisdom of figuring out what the golden mean is. And it's not easy—there are no universal rules because what constitutes the mean depends on circumstances and individuals.\"\n\nAristotle identified four types of people in relation to virtue:\n1. **Virtuous**: Those who naturally do the right thing\n2. **Encratic**: Those who know what's right and force themselves to do it\n3. **Acratic**: Those who know what's right but can't bring themselves to do it\n4. **Vicious**: Those who consistently do the wrong thing\n\n\"According to Aristotle,\" Pigliucci explains, \"the major problem humanity has is *akrasia*—weakness of the will. We all suffer from it at one point or another.\" The solution? \"The same way you get to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice.\"\n\n### Stoicism: Focusing on What's in Our Control\n\nWhile Pigliucci has discussed Stoicism in depth previously, he provides a concise overview: \"The Stoics taught that we should live according to nature. What is nature for us? We are social primates and we are intelligent animals.\"\n\nEpictetus, the Stoic philosopher, famously divided things into two categories:\n- **Up to us**: Our judgments, decisions to act, and values\n- **Not up to us**: Our body, property, reputation, relationships\n\n\"Another way to think about it,\" Pigliucci suggests, \"is I control my efforts but not the outcomes of those efforts. I'm in charge of what I do, but I'm not in charge of what happens as a result.\"\n\nThe Stoics recognized four cardinal virtues: wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. Everything else—health, wealth, reputation—they considered \"indifferent,\" meaning they don't determine your character or happiness.\n\n### Cynicism: Living Like Dogs\n\nThe Cynics took virtue ethics to its extreme. \"Cynic literally means dog-like,\" Pigliucci explains. \"They lived like dogs and were proud of it.\"\n\nThe most famous Cynic, Diogenes of Sinope, lived in a barrel and owned nothing. When Alexander the Great offered him anything he wanted, Diogenes famously replied: \"You could get out of the sun because you're blocking my sun.\"\n\nCynics valued three types of freedom:\n- **Eleutheria**: Freedom from social restrictions\n- **Autarkeia**: Self-sufficiency\n- **Parrhesia**: Freedom of speech\n\n\"For the Cynics,\" Pigliucci summarizes, \"it's all about virtue. That's it. Nothing else matters. In fact, other things get in the way.\" They represent the monastic extreme of virtue ethics.\n\n### Platonism: The Philosopher-Kings\n\nFinally, Plato's philosophy represents perhaps the most comprehensive system of ancient thought. As philosopher Alfred North Whitehead noted: \"An argument can be made that all of Western philosophy is but a series of footnotes to Plato.\"\n\nPlato's most famous political statement comes from his Seventh Letter: \"The human race will have no respite from evils until those who are really philosophers acquire political power or until, through some divine dispensation, those who rule and have political authority in the cities become real philosophers.\"\n\nFor Plato, a philosopher isn't an academic but a \"lover of wisdom.\" His ideal society in *The Republic* would be governed by these wise individuals, with everyone doing what they're best suited for.\n\nPlato also developed a tripartite theory of the soul:\n- **Rational part**: Logical thinking (located in the head)\n- **Spirited part**: Emotions (located in the heart)\n- **Appetitive part**: Physical desires (located in the stomach)\n\n\"A good human life,\" Pigliucci explains, \"a eudaimonic life, is the result of a balance, an internal balance, just as a good human society results from an external balance.\"\n\nPlato ranked government systems from best to worst:\n1. **Aristocracy** (rule by the best/wise)\n2. **Timocracy** (rule by the brave/honorable)\n3. **Oligarchy** (rule by the wealthy)\n4. **Democracy** (rule by the people/mob)\n5. **Tyranny** (rule by a dictator)\n\nPigliucci notes the contemporary relevance: \"For Plato, democracy was simply majority rule with no protections for minorities—mob rule. Once you have mob rule, the next step is you degenerate into a tyranny where some populist politician convinces the majority that he knows what he's doing.\"\n\n## Conclusion: Ancient Wisdom for Modern Lives\n\nAs Pigliucci concludes this first part of his exploration, he emphasizes the enduring relevance of these ancient philosophies: \"We're looking at questions like: What is the purpose of a life well-lived? Do we want to become rich and famous? Do we want to experience pleasure? Do we want to live in a serene manner? Do we want to become a good person? These are some of the possible answers you can give to what constitutes a eudaimonic life.\"\n\nThe journey through the ports of pleasure and character reveals multiple pathways to the good life, each with its own insights and limitations. From the immediate physical pleasures of the Cyrenaics to the serene absence of pain sought by Epicureans, from Aristotle's golden mean to the Cynics' radical virtue and Plato's philosophical rulers—these ancient frameworks continue to offer wisdom for modern living.\n\nIn Part Two, Pigliucci will explore the remaining port of doubt and venture into the territory of \"here be dragons\"—the more complex and potentially dangerous philosophical territories that complete the ancient Greco-Roman landscape.\n\n*This talk was presented by Professor Massimo Pigliucci on March 23, 2023. Part Two will take place on April 27, 2023.*",
