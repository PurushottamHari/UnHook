      "string": "The Supreme Court has permitted the use of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR during Diwali, from October 18 to 21, between 6 PM and 10 PM. Only certified green firecrackers, which emit 30-40% less pollutants and are approved by NEERI and PESO, are allowed. These must have QR codes for authenticity and can only be sold by licensed offline sellers, with online sales banned. The decision balances environmental concerns under Article 21 with livelihood rights under Article 19, aiming to regulate pollution while supporting the industry. Authorities will monitor air quality and submit impact reports to the court."

      "markdown_string": "# Supreme Court Permits Green Firecrackers in Delhi-NCR for Diwali: A Balanced Approach to Tradition and Pollution Control\n\nIn a significant ruling, the Supreme Court of India has allowed the use of green firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region during Diwali, marking a notable shift from the blanket bans imposed in recent years. The decision, delivered on October 18th by a bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia, seeks to strike a balance between environmental protection and the cultural and economic rights of citizens and manufacturers.\n\n---\n\n## 📜 Background: The Long-Standing Pollution Crisis\n\nDelhi-NCR consistently ranks among the world’s most polluted regions, especially during the winter months of October and November. A combination of factors—stubble burning in neighboring states, vehicular emissions, and industrial pollution—pushes the Air Quality Index (AQI) into the \"severe\" category. The use of conventional firecrackers during Diwali has historically exacerbated this crisis.\n\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court imposed a complete ban on conventional firecrackers but permitted the use of **green firecrackers**, which release 30–40% less particulate matter. Despite this, state governments in Delhi-NCR continued to enforce a total ban, citing practical difficulties in distinguishing between green and traditional firecrackers.\n\nThis year, manufacturers of green firecrackers challenged the blanket ban, arguing that it violated their fundamental **right to trade under Article 19** and unfairly penalized scientifically approved, less-polluting products.\n\n---\n\n## ⚖️ The Court’s Ruling: Conditions and Regulations\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision is not an unconditional approval. It comes with a series of strict regulations to minimize environmental harm:\n\n### ✅ Permitted Firecrackers:\n- Only **green firecrackers** certified by:\n  - **NEERI** (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute)\n  - **PESO** (Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation)\n- Three approved variants:\n  1. **Safe Water Releaser (SWAS)**: Releases water vapor to suppress dust.\n  2. **Star and Agni Vaisha**: Reduces sulfur oxide emissions.\n  3. **Safe Thermite Crackers (STC)**: Lower noise and particulate matter.\n\n### 🔍 Identification & Sale:\n- Each firecracker must carry a **QR code** for authenticity verification.\n- **Online sales** (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart) are **prohibited**.\n- Only **licensed offline sellers** in Delhi-NCR may sell green firecrackers.\n- Firecrackers from outside Delhi-NCR are **banned**.\n\n### 🕒 Timing Restrictions:\n- Firecrackers may only be used between **6:00 PM and 10:00 PM**.\n- The permitted window is from **October 18 to October 21**.\n\n### ⚠️ Enforcement & Monitoring:\n- Violations may lead to fines or criminal prosecution under:\n  - The **Air Act (1981)**\n  - The **Environment Protection Act (1986)**\n- Real-time air quality monitoring will be conducted by the **Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)** and state boards.\n- A detailed report on the environmental impact must be submitted to the Supreme Court post-Diwali.\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 What Are Green Firecrackers?\n\nGreen firecrackers are not pollution-free—they still emit pollutants, but at significantly reduced levels. Developed by **CSIR and NEERI**, they:\n\n- Reduce emissions by **30–40%**\n- Replace toxic components like **barium nitrate, lead, arsenic, and chromium** with safer alternatives such as **potassium nitrate** and **carbon-based additives**\n- Use **low-emission oxidizers** to curb PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels\n\n---\n\n## 🌫️ Environmental Concerns Remain\n\nDespite being greener, these firecrackers still contribute to pollution. Data from the CPCB showed that even limited use in 2023 caused AQI levels to rise by **150–200 points**. Key concerns include:\n\n- Low wind speed and **temperature inversion** during Diwali trap pollutants.\n- Widespread use could push AQI into the **\"severe\" category**.\n- Effective implementation of regulations remains a challenge.\n\n---\n\n## 💼 Economic & Social Implications\n\n- **Manufacturers and sellers** welcome the decision, as it supports livelihoods in the firecracker industry.\n- The ruling attempts to **balance fundamental rights**—clean air (Article 21) and the right to trade (Article 19).\n- Public reaction is **mixed**: some celebrate the return of tradition, while others fear a spike in pollution.\n\n---\n\n## 🔮 The Way Forward\n\nThis decision is seen as a **test case** for future policy. Its success will depend on:\n\n- Strict enforcement of time, type, and sale restrictions\n- Public cooperation in using only certified green firecrackers\n- Continuous monitoring and transparent reporting\n\nThe Supreme Court has opted for a **regulated, technology-backed approach** rather than an outright ban—a move that could shape India’s environmental and cultural policy for years to come.\n\n---\n\n> 💬 *What are your thoughts on the Supreme Court’s decision?
