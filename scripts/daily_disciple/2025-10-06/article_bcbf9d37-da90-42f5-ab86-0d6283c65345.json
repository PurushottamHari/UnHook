      "string": "Effective AI prompting in 2025 relies less on complex prompts and more on providing better context. The video introduces five layers of context: 1) Training Data (the model's general knowledge), 2) System Prompt (hidden instructions and trigger words that improve responses), 3) User Preferences (custom settings for communication style), 4) Project Knowledge (uploading specific files for contextual awareness), and 5) The Final Prompt (crafting precise requests leveraging all previous layers). By mastering these context levels, users can transform AI from a generic assistant into a highly informed, strategic team member capable of delivering deeply personalized and actionable results."

      "markdown_string": "# 5 Context Levels for Better AI Prompting in 2025\n\nWhat if you could get better results from AI with a simple prompt than with a complex one? The reality is, you can—because getting the most out of AI in 2025 is no longer about better prompting. The secret lies in giving it better **context**.\n\nBut what does that actually mean? And how can you use it to transform your AI from a forgetful assistant into your most valuable team member?\n\nLet’s start with the foundation.\n\n---\n\n## Level 1: Training Data — The AI’s “Business Degree”\n\nEvery large language model (LLM) you interact with has read billions—even trillions—of documents. It has what amounts to a business degree. It knows *some* things about business. But it knows *nothing* about *you*.\n\nHere’s a quick demonstration:\n\n> “Give me a marketing strategy for our flagship product.”\n\nThe AI charges ahead and delivers what looks like a well-thought-out, comprehensive strategy. But it’s not. It doesn’t know your audience segments. It’s guessing—and often guessing wrong.\n\nFor example, it might suggest SEO or partnerships when your business doesn’t use them. It might target consultants when your real audience is business owners. The response is generic, invented, and ultimately useless.\n\nWhy? Because it’s based solely on **Level 1 context**: the model’s training data.\n\nMany people obsess over using the latest, most advanced model—the one with more trillions of parameters. But that’s missing the point. What matters now isn’t the size or sophistication of the model. It’s **how much context you give it**.\n\n---\n\n## Level 2: The System Prompt — The Hidden 120-Page Rulebook\n\nDid you know there’s a 120-page document controlling and shaping every response an LLM gives you? Most people don’t. This is the **system prompt**—a hidden set of instructions created by the companies that build these models.\n\nYou can’t edit the system prompt, but you *can* exploit it.\n\nFor instance, Claude has seven trigger words that force the model into deeper analysis and thinking. Using one—or better yet, several—of these words can yield a **10x improvement** in response quality, with no additional context.\n\nTry this:\n\n> “Give me an **in-depth, comprehensive** marketing strategy for our flagship product.”\n\nJust adding those two or three words transforms the output. The AI now considers market size, growth trends, competitive landscape, and core positioning. It’s deeper, more thoughtful, and genuinely strategic—not just longer.\n\nThis is Level 2 context in action.\n\n> 💡 Pro tip: I’ve compiled a breakdown of hidden system prompts for Claude and GPT-5, including trigger words and design principles. Check the description for a link.\n\n---\n\n## Level 3: User Preferences — Tell the AI How You Like to Communicate\n\nThis is the first level where *you* take control.\n\nYou can tell the LLM how you want it to communicate with you—and these preferences apply across every chat, every time.\n\nFor example, in Claude, you can set **personal preferences** like:\n\n- Answer in bullet points and sub-bullet points\n- Be conservative in your thinking\n- Tell me your level of certainty\n\nOnce saved, these preferences shape all future interactions. In ChatGPT, the same feature is called **Custom Instructions**.\n\nThe result? More useful, personalized, and reliable responses—without having to repeat yourself.\n\n---\n\n## Level 4: Project Knowledge — Your AI’s “Brain”\n\nThis is the most transformative—and most underused—layer of context.\n\nImagine your AI doesn’t just know *business*—it knows *your* business.\n\nLet’s go back to our marketing strategy prompt, but this time with **project knowledge** enabled:\n\n> “Give me a marketing strategy for our flagship product.”\n\nNow, the AI knows:\n\n- The name and abbreviation of your product\n- That you’re in “Cohort 2”\n- Your target audience: businesses with 10–50 employees\n- That you work with digital agencies and professional services firms\n- Testimonials from past participants\n- Your content platforms: email newsletter and LinkedIn\n- Your event sign-up tool (e.g., Luma)\n- Your sales channels and competitors\n\nThis isn’t guesswork. This is specific, accurate, and deeply informed.\n\n### How It Works\n\nIn apps like Whisper Flow or Claude, you can create **projects**—dedicated workspaces for specific initiatives. Upload files: customer testimonials, strategy docs, positioning statements, applications, pain points—anything relevant.\n\nEvery conversation within that project automatically draws from these files. You’re no longer talking to an intern on their first day. You’re collaborating with a **fully onboarded, highly experienced team member**.\n\n---\n\n## Level 5: The Prompt — Where Everything Comes Together\n\nYou’ve built four layers of permanent context. Now comes the moment of truth: your actual prompt.\n\nBut you don’t need a library of pre-written, complex prompts. You can have the AI **help you write the prompt itself**.\n\nExample:\n\n> “Help me create a new prompt that will generate a comprehensive, in-depth marketing strategy for Cohort 3 of Second Brain Enterprise (October 2025). Include analysis of past complaints and wins, team assignments and OKRs, and 10 YouTube video ideas tied to our persona and benefits.”\n\nThe AI draws from project knowledge, structures the request, and produces a highly detailed prompt—which you can then use to generate the full strategy.\n\nThe result? A response that includes:\n\n- Differentiators and proof points\n- YouTube video ideas with direct relevance\n- Case study templates\n- Email nurture sequences\n- Sales enablement materials\n- ROI frameworks\n- Team assignments and OKRs\n\nWhat would take a human weeks to compile, the AI delivers in minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Your Roadmap to Context Mastery\n\nHere’s how to implement these five layers in less than a week:\n\n1. **Today**: Google “[Your AI] + system prompt” to find trigger words and hidden features.\n2. **Tomorrow morning**: Add 3+ user preferences (e.g., communication style, certainty level).\n3. **By the end of the week**: Create one project and upload your current work files—strategy docs, customer feedback, anything relevant.\n\nThat’s it. Three actions. Then watch your one-sentence prompts outperform what used to require an essay.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thought\n\nContext engineering doesn’t make prompt engineering obsolete—it makes it **more powerful**. When you preload the right context, even simple prompts become incredibly effective.\n\nWe’re moving into an era where the value of AI isn’t in the model—it’s in how well you teach it about *you*.\n\n---\n*Want to go deeper?
