      "string": "The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has deactivated over 2 crore Aadhaar numbers as part of a nationwide data cleanup initiative. These deactivations target individuals whose deaths have been recorded in official registries, aiming to prevent misuse such as fraudulent transactions, subsidy claims, and identity theft. The process involves cross-verifying data from sources like death registries and welfare databases. If a number is deactivated by mistake, holders can reactivate it by submitting fresh biometric authentication at regional UIDAI offices. This effort enhances data integrity, reduces fraud, and improves the efficiency of welfare schemes, though challenges like weak death registration in rural areas and wrongful deactivations remain."

      "markdown_string": "# UIDAI Deactivates Over 2 Crore Aadhaar Numbers: What You Need to Know\n\nIn a significant move, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has deactivated more than 2 crore Aadhaar numbers. This announcement has sparked widespread discussion and raised several important questions: Why was this necessary? What benefits does it bring to the government? And what should individuals do if their Aadhaar is mistakenly deactivated? Let’s explore the details.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 What Exactly Happened?\n\nUIDAI, the governing body responsible for India’s Aadhaar framework, recently deactivated over 20 million (2 crore) Aadhaar numbers. This action was not arbitrary—it specifically targeted individuals **whose deaths had been officially recorded**. \n\nUIDAI clarified that this was **not a punitive measure** against living persons who may have acquired Aadhaar through improper means. Rather, it was a focused effort to clean and modernize the Aadhaar database, marking one of the **largest data purification exercises** since Aadhaar’s launch.\n\n---\n\n## ❓ Why Was This Clean-Up Needed?\n\n### 1. **Preventing Misuse**\nAadhaar is widely used across banking, subsidies, pensions, and mobile connections. If a deceased person’s Aadhaar remains active, it can be misused:\n- Fraudulent bank account access\n- Illegitimate subsidy or welfare claims\n- Unauthorized mobile connections, potentially used for criminal activities\n\n### 2. **Ensuring Data Integrity**\nAadhaar is India’s most-used identity document. To maintain its reliability, the database must reflect only living individuals. Outdated or inactive records undermine system trust and efficiency.\n\n### 3. **Improving Public Expenditure Efficiency**\nDeceased individuals’ Aadhaar numbers were still being used to claim pensions, subsidies, and welfare benefits—leading to significant financial leakage. Deactivation helps **plug these leaks** and ensures public funds reach the intended beneficiaries.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How Were Deceased Persons Identified?\n\nUIDAI used **multiple data sources** to identify deceased individuals:\n- Government registries (e.g., Registrar General of India)\n- State and Union Territory civil registration systems\n- Local death registration authorities\n- Welfare scheme databases (Public Distribution System, National Social Assistance Program, etc.)\n\nThrough **data matching and cross-validation**, UIDAI verified details like Aadhaar number, death registration number, demographic data, and place of death before deactivation.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 What If Your Aadhaar Is Wrongly Deactivated?\n\nMistakes can happen in automated systems. If a living person’s Aadhaar is deactivated in error, they can **reactivate it** by:\n- Visiting a regional or state UIDAI office\n- Submitting a fresh application with biometric authentication (fingerprint, iris, face)\n- The number will be restored—it is **not permanently deleted or reassigned to another person**\n\n---\n\n## 📲 How to Report a Death in the Family\n\nUIDAI has introduced a facility on the **My Aadhaar portal** allowing family members to request deactivation of a deceased person’s Aadhaar. The applicant must provide:\n- Their own Aadhaar details\n- The deceased’s Aadhaar number\n- Death registration number\n- Other demographic details\n\nThis service is currently available in **25 states and Union Territories**, with plans to expand nationwide.\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Deactivation Drive: By the Numbers\n\nThis isn’t a sudden action—the drive began in **mid-2024** and has progressed as follows:\n- July 2025: 1.17 crore deactivated\n- September 2025: 1.4 crore deactivated\n- Present: Over 2 crore deactivated\n\nThis marks the **largest Aadhaar cleanup drive** in India’s history.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Benefits of the Clean-Up\n\n- **Reduced Aadhaar-based fraud**\n- **Improved accuracy** of welfare schemes\n- **Enhanced reliability** of Aadhaar authentication\n- **Curbed leakage** in subsidies and pensions\n- **Dynamic, continuously updated system**\n- **Encouraged stronger birth and death registration systems**\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Challenges and Weaknesses\n\n- **Weak death registration** in many states, especially rural and remote areas\n- **Wrongful deactivation** of living persons’ Aadhaar\n- **Limited online death reporting** (only 25 states currently)\n- **Persistent issues** like duplicate Aadhaar, fraudulent enrollments, and ghost beneficiaries remain unresolved\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 The Big Picture\n\nThis drive signals a shift from a **static Aadhaar system to a continuously updated one**. It represents a serious effort toward **data hygiene** and alignment between Aadhaar and India’s death registration systems. While challenges remain, the overall significance of this exercise is substantial.\n\n---\n\n> 🔔 *Interested in daily updates on government policies and exam-related news?
