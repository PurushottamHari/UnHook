      "string": "Dhruv Rathee presents six pieces of evidence alleging widespread fraud in the Bihar elections. These include the timing of a ₹10,000 cash transfer to women just before voting, duplicate voters casting ballots in multiple states, special trains funded by BJP to transport voters, rule changes to prevent access to and delete CCTV footage, mass deletion of genuine voters from electoral rolls, and bias in the Election Commission's conduct. He argues these actions compromised electoral integrity and challenges authorities to address the evidence, emphasizing the need for fair elections in India's democracy."

      "markdown_string": "**Alleged Fraud in Bihar Elections: Six Key Evidences**\n\n---\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe recently concluded Bihar elections have been described by critics as potentially the most unfair in Indian history. The sheer scale of alleged electoral manipulation has raised serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in India. While some dismiss these claims as excuses from a defeated opposition, a deeper look reveals troubling patterns and institutional failures that demand scrutiny.\n\nThis article presents six key pieces of evidence pointing to systematic fraud—from financial inducements and duplicate voters to legal changes that critics argue were designed to conceal malpractice. Each point challenges the impartiality of the Election Commission and the ruling government, calling into question the very foundation of free and fair elections.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The ₹10,000 Scheme: Legalized Bribery?\n\nOne of the most glaring allegations involves the transfer of ₹10,000 to women’s bank accounts just days before voting began. Under the guise of a welfare initiative to support small businesses, approximately 12.5 million women received these payments—with a promise of up to ₹200,000 more in the future.\n\n**Key Concerns:**\n- **Timing:** Payments were made after the Model Code of Conduct came into effect on October 6th—on October 17th, 24th, 31st, and November 7th.\n- **Conditionality:** Recipients had to join the Jeevika Self-Help Group, and many were later deployed as election volunteers.\n- **Precedent:** In past elections, similar schemes—such as free TVs in Tamil Nadu or cash transfers in Telangana—were halted by the Election Commission to prevent voter influence.\n\n> \"Was this an election or a chit fund scheme?\" the presenter asks. \"In Bihar, the poorest state, dangling ₹10,000—and the promise of more—just before an election is nothing short of legalized bribery.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. Duplicate Voters: A Systemic Failure\n\nEvidence has emerged of individuals voting in multiple states—including Bihar, Delhi, and Haryana—using the same or multiple voter IDs. Public posts on social media revealed several such cases, including BJP worker Nagendra Kumar and voter Ajit Jha.\n\n**Investigative Findings:**\n- A report by The Reporters’ Collective identified **1.435 million suspected duplicate voters** in Bihar’s final voter list.\n- Of these, **342,000 had identical details** on multiple voter IDs.\n- The Election Commission abandoned established software used to detect and remove duplicates, raising questions about intent.\n\nDespite public appeals and media coverage, the Election Commission has remained silent—even as evidence mounts of a compromised electoral roll.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Special Voter Trains: Free Rides for Votes\n\nIn the days leading up to the election, the BJP organized special trains to bring voters from Haryana to Bihar. While framed as a service to help citizens vote, critics argue it violated electoral laws.\n\n**Legal Breach:**\n- The **Representation of the People Act, 1951** prohibits candidates from providing free transport to voters.\n- ABP News videos showed passengers confirming that the BJP covered all expenses:\n  - *\"Who paid for your ticket?\"*  \n  - *\"The Modi government.\"*  \n  - *\"They didn’t take any money.\"*\n\nDespite clear rules, the Election Commission took no action—allowing what many see as a form of electoral trafficking.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Changing CCTV Rules: Erasing the Evidence\n\nCCTV footage from polling stations is crucial for verifying voter identity, detecting impersonation, and ensuring transparency. Yet, the Election Commission moved to restrict access to this evidence.\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- After a Punjab and Haryana High Court order mandated sharing CCTV footage, the government amended the **Conduct of Election Rules, 1961**, excluding CCTV from the list of documents available to the public.\n- A new rule stipulated that footage would be **deleted after 45 days** if results weren’t legally challenged.\n- Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar defended the move by asking, *\"Should the EC share the CCTV videos of our mothers, sisters, daughters?\"*\n\nCritics see this as a deliberate effort to hide malpractice.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Voter Deletion: Silencing the Opposition\n\nThrough the **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** of the voter list, approximately **8 million names**—nearly 10% of Bihar’s electorate—were removed. Many allege these were targeted deletions aimed at opposition strongholds.\n\n**Patterns of Exclusion:**\n- The Seemanchal region, an opposition bastion, saw **7.7% of names deleted**—higher than the state average of 5.9%.\n- Muslims, who constitute 16.9% of Bihar’s population, accounted for **33% of deletions**.\n- Dalit and tribal communities were also disproportionately affected.\n\nVideos from polling stations showed frustrated voters turned away:\n- *\"My name was deleted.\"*  \n- *\"We haven’t voted—how can we have the ink?\"*  \n- *\"Someone had already voted using our details.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 6. Institutional Bias: An Election Commission Under Scrutiny\n\nThe Election Commission’s impartiality has been repeatedly questioned—from scheduling elections in multiple phases to benefit the ruling party, to ignoring violations of the Model Code of Conduct.\n\n**Appointment Process:**\n- A Supreme Court-mandated committee for selecting Election Commissioners was altered by the Modi government in 2023, replacing the Chief Justice of India with a Union Minister.\n- This gave the government unchecked power in appointing officials—raising concerns about independence.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest:**\n- Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar announced the SIR on June 24, 2025. The next day, his son-in-law was appointed DM of Saharanpur. A month later, his daughter became the DM of Noida.\n- Critics ask: *\"Is this a coincidence or a reward?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: A Democracy at a Crossroads\n\nThe six evidences presented paint a grim picture of an election marred by financial inducement, institutional manipulation, and legal obfuscation. While the courts continue to hear petitions, the results stand—and with them, a dangerous precedent.\n\n> \"It is not about which party won,\" the presenter concludes. \"It is about whether our elections can still be trusted. When manipulation becomes technical and systemic, the voice of the people is the first casualty.\"\n\nThe Bihar elections may be over, but the battle for electoral integrity has just begun. As SIR rolls out in 12 more states, the question remains: Will India’s democracy withstand the assault—or will it become a mere formality, decided not by voters, but by manipulation?\n\n---\n\n*This article is based on publicly available evidence, investigative reports, and video testimonials.
