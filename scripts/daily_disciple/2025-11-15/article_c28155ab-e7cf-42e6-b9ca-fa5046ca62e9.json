      "markdown_string": "# Bomb Squad Deployed at Al Falah University Amid Terror Investigation\n\n## University Under Scrutiny After Delhi Blast\n\nAl Falah University in Faridabad has become the center of a major security investigation following the recent bomb blast in Delhi. The institution, now infamous nationwide, is facing serious questions about its potential connection to the terror attack.\n\nIn a dramatic development, a Bomb Disposal Squad was recently deployed to the university campus after a suspicious vehicle was discovered on the premises. The entire campus has been placed on high alert as authorities investigate whether explosive materials may be present.\n\n## The Delhi Blast Connection\n\nThe investigation gained momentum after the November 10, 2025 blast in the national capital. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Delhi Police have been jointly investigating the case, with several suspects emerging during the probe.\n\n**Key developments include:**\n- Multiple doctors, including Dr. Shaheen Shahid, have been named as suspects\n- A vehicle linked to suspect Dr. Shahid was found on the Al Falah University campus\n- Many suspects either taught at the university or were frequent visitors\n- The university's website was hacked by Indian hacker groups alleging \"anti-national activities\"\n\n## Questionable Credentials and History\n\nFurther scrutiny has revealed concerning details about the university's operations:\n\n**Accreditation Claims:**\nThe university had long claimed to be accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), but this has been proven false. The NAAC has confirmed the institution lacks proper accreditation.\n\n**Founder Background:**\nThe university's founder, Siddiqui, operates nine companies connected to the Al Falah Charitable Trust and faces a ₹75 crore cheating case in Madhya Pradesh.\n\n**Suspicious Activities:**\nMultiple reports suggest secret meetings may have occurred in university facilities, with articles specifically mentioning \"Building Number 17, Room Number 13\" in the hostel where doctors allegedly plotted terror activities.\n\n## Ongoing Investigation\n\nAuthorities are conducting a comprehensive forensic audit of the university covering 2019 to 2025. This investigation will examine:\n- Financial records and funding sources\n- The university's operational history\n- Connections between staff and terror suspects\n\nThe university's website has been taken down, and action has been initiated regarding the false accreditation claims.\n\n## International Disinformation Campaign\n\nThe situation has been complicated by a massive disinformation campaign originating from Pakistan. Evidence shows:\n\n**Organized Propaganda Centers:**\nPakistan has established dedicated \"digital centers\" specifically designed to wage \"narrative wars\" against India. One such center explicitly states: \"This is where we win the narrative war from.\"\n\n**False Narratives:**\n- AI-generated videos claiming the Delhi blast was an accident\n- Fake police officer videos suggesting it was a CNG blast rather than a terror attack\n- Mass-scale social media manipulation using Indian-sounding names\n\n**Timing Exploitation:**\nThe disinformation campaign capitalized on the 48-hour delay before Indian authorities officially declared the incident a terrorist attack, giving Pakistan room to establish their narrative.\n\n## Government Response\n\nHome Minister Amit Shah has issued a strong statement: \"Delhi blast punishment will warn the world against attacking India again.\" This indicates significant planned actions from the Indian government.\n\n## Broader Implications\n\nThe Al Falah University case raises critical questions about:\n- Accountability mechanisms for educational institutions\n- Monitoring of university funding and activities\n- Preventing similar situations in the future\n\n## Call for Public Vigilance\n\nAuthorities urge citizens to exercise caution on social media, noting that:\n- Pakistani operatives are mass-commenting on YouTube videos using Indian names\n- Fake videos and narratives are being systematically spread\n- Verification of sources is essential before sharing content\n\nAs the investigation continues, more updates are expected to reveal the full extent of activities at Al Falah University and their connection to the Delhi terror attack.\n\n*The truth about Al Falah University must come before the nation, as it raises fundamental questions about how we ensure accountability for educational institutions in our country and prevent such situations in the future.*",
