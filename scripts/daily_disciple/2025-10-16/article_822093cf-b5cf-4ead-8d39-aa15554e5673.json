      "string": "Acharya Prashant addresses a woman from the SC community who faces family and societal disapproval for questioning traditions. He explains the difference between dharma (eternal principles), darshan (philosophy), and culture (daily habits and traditions). He argues that Indian culture has mistakenly become enslaved to outdated customs from a dark historical period, rather than being guided by profound philosophy. He advises marginalized individuals, especially women and Dalits, to stop expecting validation from a system that offers them nothing and to find liberation by discarding the past and living freely according to higher truths, not restrictive traditions."

      "markdown_string": "**Acharya Prashant on Culture, Tradition, and Liberation**\n\n---\n\n## The Question from Kusum\n\nA young woman named Kusum stands before Acharya Prashant, her voice trembling with the weight of a lifetime of contradictions. She is educated, thoughtful, and from the SC (Scheduled Caste) community in Madhya Pradesh. Her pain is twofold: her family is unhappy with her, and society refuses to see her worth.\n\nShe recalls questioning the oppressive norms of her village as a child:  \n> “We were first to arrive, yet why couldn’t we draw water from the handpump? There was a water shortage at home. Still, we weren’t allowed.”\n\nHer family, like the entire community, lived in fear. When she challenged these customs, they were hurt. “Everything has been going on like this,” they said. “Who are you to question it?”\n\nKusum rebelled. She refused to take part in rituals, rejected dowry, and declared she wanted nothing from her parents. Yet, they were still unhappy—this time because she wanted nothing from them.\n\nShe tried to teach biology, her passion. Coaching centers offered low pay and rigid methods. When she offered to teach poor children for minimal fees, parents doubted her:  \n> “How can you teach so well for so little?”\n\nEven her students, when she simplified complex concepts, grew suspicious:  \n> “How did I understand it so quickly? It can’t be that easy.”\n\nKusum is caught between a family bound by tradition and a society that distrusts her sincerity. She ends with a plea:  \n> “I am unhappy, they are unhappy… What should I do, Sir?”\n\n---\n\n## Acharya’s Response: The Trap of “Culture”\n\nAcharya Prashant listens intently. He does not offer comfort. Instead, he dismantles the very framework of her suffering.\n\n### The Golden Plate Filled with Mud\n\nHe begins with a powerful analogy:  \n> “Our thinkers and sages left us a golden plate—the highest philosophy, the deepest wisdom. But what have we served on it? Mud. We are eating that mud, and then shouting, ‘This is great!’”\n\nHe clarifies the hierarchy of values:\n\n- **Philosophy (Darshan)**: The pursuit of truth.\n- **Dharma**: The bridge between our limited self and infinite possibility.\n- **Culture (Sanskriti)**: Merely our habits, customs, and behaviors.\n\n> “Culture is just your way of life. What you eat, how you greet, what you wear, how you mourn—these are all culture. It has nothing to do with Dharma or philosophy.”\n\n### Culture as a Tool of Oppression\n\nAcharya points out the tragic irony:  \n> “We have made culture the master of tradition and habit. We call it ‘Sanskriti’ and worship it, even when it’s rooted in fear, scarcity, and oppression.”\n\nHe challenges the notion of “ancient culture”:  \n> “If you want to go back, why stop at 200–400 years? Why not go to the Vedic era? But then you’d find a culture so open and liberal that today’s society would call it anti-national.”\n\nThe culture being enforced today, he argues, comes from the **darkest period of Indian history**—a time of sati, caste rigidity, and intellectual stagnation.\n\n> “We are trying to impose the mental, economic, and behavioral conditions of a backward era onto modern life—and calling it culture.”\n\n### The Foreignness of “Pure” Culture\n\nAcharya dismantles the myth of cultural purity with sharp examples:\n\n- Tea, samosa, jalebi, potato, tomato, biryani, birthday cake—all “foreign.”\n- Even the kurta-pajama, often seen as traditional, is not what the sages wore.\n\n> “If you remove everything foreign from your plate, nothing will remain.”\n\n---\n\n## The Liberation of No Expectations\n\nAcharya turns directly to Kusum—and to every marginalized listener:\n\n> “You should have no expectations from anyone. There is nothing for you in history or tradition. Do not hope—if you hope, your heart will break. And this is good news.”\n\n### Why It’s Good News\n\n> “If there’s nothing for you there, you don’t have to value it. Why cling to a past that only offered you bondage?”\n\nHe speaks especially to women and Dalits:\n\n> “There is no greater wonder than a woman seeking freedom from the past. And a Dalit woman? That is the greatest wonder of all. The past holds nothing for you but chains.”\n\n### Stop Trying to Explain\n\nAcharya warns Kusum against trying to convince others:\n\n> “The possibility that people will understand you is very low. Every seed needs the right soil. You are not in a favorable position—and your gender makes it even harder.”\n\nHe quotes Kabir:  \n> “Kabira, your hut is near the butchers… Don’t expect the butchers to understand your truth.”\n\n### Create Your Own System\n\n> “There is nothing at all for you in this system. So why are you obliged to follow it? Women should be the first to say goodbye to it. But often, we see the opposite—women at the forefront of upholding regressive customs.”\n\nHe draws a parallel with India’s independence:\n\n> “When India became free, did we keep the Union Jack? No. We changed the flag, the constitution, the street names. Because that past had nothing for us. Do the same.”\n\n---\n\n## The Path Forward: Be the “Bad Girl”\n\nAcharya ends with a radical prescription:\n\n> “Girls are raised to be ‘good girls.’ They wake up on time, eat right, help their mother, get good marks, and sleep. Boys can be naughty—they can come home after breaking walls. But girls must be Sushila (virtuous).”\n\nHe looks at Kusum:\n\n> “You’ve built a habit of being the good girl in everyone’s eyes. Now, I’m telling you: be the bad girl.”\n\nWhen Kusum insists she has already rebelled, he challenges her:\n\n> “If you had truly let go, you wouldn’t be here saying you’re unhappy because they’re unhappy. You’re still hoping.”\n\n### A Final Warning\n\n> “Your situation is delicate. Especially as a woman, and a Dalit woman. You need immense discipline. Don’t wander left and right. Many are waiting to trap you.”\n\n---\n\n## A Voice from the Audience\n\nAfter the dialogue, another woman stands—Garima Singh Chandela, a teacher from Uttar Pradesh. She has been following Acharya Prashant for two and a half years, and participating in Gita sessions for the last one.\n\n> “The two New Years we’ve celebrated with Acharya Ji—especially this last one—were unlike any in my life. In the light of self-knowledge, abandon blind actions. Be hopeless, be merciless, be free from fever. Let only the battle remain.”\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Culture is not Dharma**: It is merely habit, custom, and behavior—often shaped by historical conditions of fear and lack.\n- **The past holds nothing for the marginalized**: Women, Dalits, and oppressed communities should be the first to discard oppressive traditions.\n- **Stop seeking validation**: The system is not designed to reward your truth. Build your own path.\n- **Be fearless, not “good”**: Liberation requires breaking the mold of the “good girl” or “obedient citizen.”\n\nAcharya Prashant’s message is not one of reform, but of **radical self-liberation**. The golden plate of philosophy is yours—stop eating the mud of culture served upon it.",
