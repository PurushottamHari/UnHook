However, India has not fully utilized its deep-sea and offshore fishing potential within its Exclusive Economic Zone. NITI Aayog highlights the need for a three-phase strategy to harness this potential, addressing challenges like unclear regulations beyond 12 nautical miles, lack of infrastructure, high costs, and insufficient data. The plan aims to boost exports, diversify products beyond shrimp, improve fishing communities' livelihoods, and support India's goal of becoming a developed nation by leveraging marine resources sustainably."

Here is the article crafted from the provided Hindi transcript, adapted into a clear, well-structured, and engaging English format.\n\n***\n\n# India's Untapped Blue Economy: The Deep-Sea Fishing Goldmine\n\n## The Paradox of India's Marine Exports\n\nIndia's seafood export figures present a fascinating story of potential and paradox. In the 2024-25 financial year, these exports stood at a significant ₹60,000 crore. However, a deeper look reveals a critical detail: the single largest contributor to this export basket is not exotic tuna or high-value fish, but **shrimp**.\n\nThis reliance on a single commodity, primarily farmed in coastal regions, underscores a massive untapped opportunity. Despite possessing a vast maritime territory and an immense water body, India has not been able to harness the full potential of its marine sector. The contribution of this \"Blue Economy\" to the national GDP is not growing at the pace it should.\n\nThis is the very untapped potential that NITI Aayog has recently highlighted. The government's think tank has laid out a clear directive: if India is to achieve its goal of becoming a 'Viksit Bharat' (Developed India) by 2047, it must harness its deep-sea and offshore fishing potential in **three strategic phases**. The vision of a developed India is not solely reliant on manufacturing or services; it requires the participation and growth of **all sectors**, and the Blue Economy is a crucial piece of that puzzle.\n\n## Understanding the Blue Economy's Vast Scope\n\nTo grasp the significance of India's Blue Economy, one must first understand its global scale. The global Blue Economy is estimated to be worth a staggering **$3 to $6 trillion**—roughly the size of the entire Indian economy. Within this, the fisheries and aquaculture sector alone generates about **$100 billion in annual revenue** and creates **260 million jobs globally**.\n\nAs the speaker aptly notes, \"Hoga bhi na bhaiya, arth ke mass ka 70% jo area hai uska 70% water hi hai.\" (It makes sense, brother, 70% of the Earth's mass is water.). The rest of the world is exploiting this potential; the question is, why can't India?\n\nBut the Blue Economy is not just about fishing. It's a holistic concept that includes:\n*   **Marine Transport and Trade**\n*   **Untapped Deep-Sea Resources** (minerals, energy)\n*   **Biotechnology** (pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals from marine organisms)\n*   **Offshore Wind and Solar Energy**\n*   **Blue Carbon** (carbon captured by ocean ecosystems)\n\n## India's Maritime Geography: The Map of Opportunity\n\nIndia's maritime claim is divided into two key zones:\n1.  **Territorial Waters (12 Nautical Miles):** A thin strip where Indian laws fully apply.\n2.  **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ - 200 Nautical Miles):** A broad zone where India has exclusive economic rights to exploit and utilize all natural resources.\n\nThe critical point of concern is that the majority of India's fishing activities are confined to the **Territorial Waters**, within 12 nautical miles of the shore. The deep-sea realm, which begins at depths of 200 meters and extends through the EEZ, remains largely unexploited.\n\n## Why Hasn't India Tapped This Potential?\n\nThe stagnation in export numbers—hovering around ₹57,000 crore to ₹63,000 crore over the past few years—signals a need for change. The timing is crucial. Currently, **34% of India's marine exports go to the US**, and **19% to China**, markets already experiencing trade tensions. To de-risk and grow, India must diversify both its **export markets and its product portfolio**. Relying solely on shrimp will not suffice; high-value species like tuna and other exotic fish are needed to create a market presence in new regions.\n\nSo, what has held India back from tapping into the 7.16 million tonnes of fishery resources estimated to be in its deep-sea EEZ? The challenges are multifaceted:\n\n### 1. The Regulatory Vacuum\nBeyond the 12-nautical-mile Territorial Waters, there is **no clear-cut licensing mechanism** for deep-sea fishing in the EEZ. This lack of regulatory clarity creates massive uncertainty for private investors. Why would a private player invest crores of rupees in vessels and expeditions without any assurance of legal operation or yield? As a result, India has a paltry **four deep-sea fishing vessels**, compared to Sri Lanka's 1,800 and Iran's 1,200.\n\n### 2. Prohibitive Costs and Lack of Financing\nA single deep-sea fishing vessel can cost between **₹3 to ₹6 crore**. The operational costs, especially for imported fuel, are also a major burden. Financial institutions and banks are hesitant to fund such ventures, viewing them as \"risky business models\" due to the absence of a stable regulatory framework.\n\n### 3. Inadequate Infrastructure and Institutional Support\nSimilar to challenges in agriculture, the fisheries sector suffers from a lack of critical infrastructure:\n*   **Cold storage chains**\n*   **Modern landing centers and port facilities**\n*   **Processing infrastructure**\n*   **Certification and traceability systems**\n\nWithout subsidies and financial support, fishing communities cannot afford to make the leap into deep-sea operations.\n\n### 4. The Data Deficit\nAspiring civil servants understand the need for previous years' question papers (PYQs) to prepare. Similarly, the fishing community needs a **scientific dataset**. There is a lack of reliable data on the exact location, quantity, and type of resources available in the deep sea. Without this \"PYQ for fishing,\" communities cannot plan or invest confidently.\n\n### 5. Quality and Traceability Concerns\nAccess to premium markets like the European Union is hampered by stringent requirements. Indian consignments are often rejected due to:\n*   **Traceability issues:** Inability to document the exact origin of the catch.\n*   **Certification shortcomings:** Failure to meet international health and safety standards.\n*   **Antibiotic residue:** A major health concern found in some products.\n\nAs the speaker emphasizes, \"Quantity aapke paas hai, lekin ab uski quality par kaam karna padega.\" (You have the quantity, but now you have to work on the quality.)\n\n## Learning from Global Best Practices\n\nOther nations provide a clear roadmap for success:\n*   **Spain:** Focuses on **branding and processing**. They don't just catch fish; they can, brand (e.g., \"Spanish Tuna\"), and export, generating massive revenue.\n*   **China:** Operates the **world's largest distant-water fishing fleet**, often collaborating within other nations' EEZs.\n*   **Japan:** Implements **science-based quotas** to ensure sustainable exploitation.\n*   **USA:** Has developed a **comprehensive legal framework** supported by scientific data.\n*   **Sri Lanka:** Has made **major investments in its deep-sea vessel fleet**.\n\nThe common thread is **strong institutional mechanism and government support**.\n\n## NITI Aayog's Three-Phase Roadmap for Harnessing Deep-Sea Potential\n\nNITI Aayog's recommendations provide a structured path forward, emphasizing an **ecosystem-based approach** for long-term sustainability.\n\n### **Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (2025-2028)**\n*   Develop a **complete regulatory framework** for the 12-200 nautical mile zone.\n*   Establish **science-based management** through robust data collection.\n*   Set up **deep-sea landing centers**.\n*   Foster **collaborative governance** between central and state governments.\n\n### **Phase 2: Expansion and Modernization**\n*   Introduce **advanced deep-sea vessels**.\n*   Infuse capital through **fishing cooperatives**.\n*   Leverage **automation and technology**.\n*   Implement **training programs** for fishermen.\n\n### **Phase 3: Sustainability and Global Leadership**\n*   Ensure **long-term sustainability**.\n*   Position India as a **global hub for deep-sea fishing**.\n*   Continue to modernize and expand operations with a focus on environmental impact.\n\n## Beyond Fishing: The Wider Blue Economy Horizon\n\nThe ultimate goal is to look beyond just marine products. India's Blue Economy holds promise for:\n*   **Biotech & Pharmaceuticals:** Using resources like seaweed for nutraceuticals and medicines.\n*   **Seabed Mining:** Extracting strategic minerals and resources critical for national security.\n*   **Renewable Energy:** Harnessing offshore wind and solar power.\n*   **Blue Carbon:** Unlocking the potential of coastal ecosystems to capture carbon.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIndia stands at the cusp of a blue revolution. With a recently increased coastline and an EEZ of over 2 million square kilometers, the potential is undeniable. Tapping into the deep-sea fishing sector is not just an economic imperative; it is a strategic move to improve the livelihoods of coastal communities, enhance their quality of life, and ensure that every sector contributes to the vision of a Viksit Bharat. The plan is on the table. The challenge now lies in its collaborative and determined implementation.\n\n***\n*This article is based on an analysis by Arvind Guleriya of Study IQ IAS.*",
