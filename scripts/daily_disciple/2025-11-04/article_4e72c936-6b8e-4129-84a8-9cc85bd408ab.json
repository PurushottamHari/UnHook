The conflict, rooted in power struggles and ethnic divisions, has intensified with the RSF's recent capture of El-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur. This led to mass killings, sexual violence, and war crimes, including attacks on hospitals and displacement camps. The RSF, accused of genocide and backed by foreign entities like the UAE, has trapped civilians, causing famine and disease outbreaks. An Indian national was also recently abducted, highlighting the escalating violence."

      "markdown_string": "# Sudan Civil War: RSF Atrocities in El-Fasher\n\n## Introduction: The World’s Largest Humanitarian Crisis\n\nSudan is currently witnessing what many describe as the **largest genocide and displacement crisis of the 21st century**. Since April 2023, the country has been engulfed in a brutal civil war between two main factions: the **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)** and the **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)**. This conflict has already claimed over **150,000 lives** and displaced **12 million people**—making it the most severe humanitarian emergency globally, surpassing even the crises in Syria and Ukraine.\n\n## The Roots of the Conflict\n\n### Historical Background\n\nThe conflict traces its origins to long-standing ethnic and regional divisions within Sudan, particularly between **Arab and non-Arab communities**. The RSF, originally known as the **Janjaweed militias**, gained notoriety during the Darfur genocide (2003–2008), where they were implicated in widespread atrocities. Under former President **Omar al-Bashir**, the group was rebranded as the RSF and officially integrated into state structures to combat internal insurgencies.\n\n### Political Power Struggle\n\nIn 2019, mass protests led to the ousting of President Bashir, followed by a fragile power-sharing agreement between the military and civilian groups. However, tensions escalated between the two dominant figures:\n\n- **General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan** – Leader of the SAF, controlling formal state institutions and eastern/central Sudan.\n- **Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti)** – Commander of the RSF, with strong influence in Darfur and western regions.\n\nThe rivalry intensified in 2021 when both leaders jointly ended civilian rule. Efforts to integrate the RSF into the national army failed, leading to open warfare by April 2023.\n\n## The Humanitarian Catastrophe\n\nThe consequences of the war have been devastating:\n\n- **Mass Displacement**: Over 12 million people displaced.\n- **Famine & Disease**: Severe food shortages, a collapsed health system (80% of hospitals non-functional), and outbreaks of cholera.\n- **Human Rights Violations**: Widespread sexual violence, mass executions, and ethnic targeting.\n\n## Recent Escalation: The Siege and Fall of El-Fasher\n\n### Background on El-Fasher\n\nEl-Fasher, the capital of **North Darfur**, became a critical flashpoint. For over a year, the city was under siege by the RSF, which had encircled it since **April 2024**. The SAF maintained a presence to protect civilians, but the RSF’s blockade cut off essential supplies, trapping hundreds of thousands.\n\n### The Humanitarian Siege\n\n- **Trapped Civilians**: Over 800,000 people, including many children, were stranded without food, clean water, or medical access.\n- **UN Warnings**: The United Nations Human Rights Office warned that civilians were being “starved into submission,” with food prices soaring by 460% and famine-like conditions prevailing.\n\n### RSF’s Assault and Atrocities\n\nIn late **October 2025**, the RSF launched a full-scale assault on El-Fasher, leading to some of the worst atrocities of the conflict:\n\n- **Attack on Saudi Maternity Hospital**: RSF fighters entered the hospital and killed **460 patients** in a brutal massacre.\n- **Door-to-Door Killings**: Witnesses described RSF forces going from house to house, executing families, abducting doctors and nurses, and committing mass executions.\n- **Sexual Violence & Ethnic Targeting**: Survivors reported systematic rape, torture, and disappearances, particularly targeting **non-Arab communities**.\n- **Bombing of Displacement Camps**: Camps sheltering tens of thousands were deliberately bombed.\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the scene reveal **bloodstained streets** and mass graves, painting a horrifying picture of the violence.\n\n## International Dimensions\n\n### Foreign Involvement\n\nThe **United Arab Emirates (UAE)** has been accused of supplying weapons to the RSF, a claim supported by India’s ambassador to Sudan. This external support has exacerbated the conflict and intensified the humanitarian crisis.\n\n### Kidnapping of an Indian National\n\nRecently, an **Indian national from Odisha** working in Sudan was kidnapped by RSF fighters in El-Fasher. In a bizarre twist, the abductors questioned him about Bollywood star **Shah Rukh Khan**. Sudanese authorities are coordinating with India to secure his release.\n\n## Conclusion: A Dark Chapter in Modern History\n\nThe fall of El-Fasher marks **one of the darkest chapters in Sudan’s modern history**. With the region of Darfur—already scarred by the 2003–2008 genocide—now witnessing a repeat of history, the international community faces a critical test.\n\n**Unless global powers and the United Nations intervene decisively**, the world may witness yet another genocide unfold in Sudan. The time for action is now—before more lives are lost to this devastating conflict.\n\n---\n*This article is based on detailed analysis of recent developments and aims to provide a clear, contextual understanding of the ongoing crisis in Sudan.*",
