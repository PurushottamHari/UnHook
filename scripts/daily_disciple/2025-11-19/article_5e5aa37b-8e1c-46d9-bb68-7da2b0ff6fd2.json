      "string": "Swami Sarvapriyananda explains his preference for Advaita Vedanta despite appreciating Kashmir Shaivism's richness. He views Kashmir Shaivism as a philosophical framework for the phenomenology of spiritual experience, accommodating diverse mystical visions and deities. However, for philosophical rigor, logical consistency, and directness in conveying ultimate truth, he finds Advaita Vedanta superior. He notes Advaita is more defensible against skepticism and cites its recognition even by skeptics like Sam Harris. While spiritual seekers can benefit from both, Advaita remains his foundational tradition for its clarity and strength."

      "markdown_string": "# Why I Chose Advaita Vedanta Over Kashmir Shaivism\n\nIn a revealing conversation, a student named Julie posed a heartfelt question to a spiritual teacher: “In one of your lectures, you mentioned you were a devoted learner of Advaita Vedanta, and a friend brought you a book on Kashmir Shaivism, saying it was even bigger and more elaborate—and that you would definitely switch to it. But you never did. Can you explain why?”\n\nThe teacher’s response was both appreciative and illuminating—a thoughtful defense of philosophical clarity over experiential breadth.\n\n---\n\n## The Allure and the Hesitation\n\n“Yes,” the teacher began, “why didn’t I switch to Kashmir Shaivism, if I like it so much? If I admit all its excellencies?”\n\nThere was a pause, a moment of care. “I won’t tell you—people will feel hurt if I tell you.”\n\nInstead of a blunt critique, the teacher pointed toward a resource: *The Advaita Tradition in Indian Philosophy* by Chandrahar Sharma. At the end of that book, he noted, lies a chapter titled “A Critique of Kashmir Shaivism from an Advaita Perspective.”\n\n“In several pages,” the teacher said, “he basically tears it apart.”\n\nBut long before reading that critique, the teacher had already sensed the core issue.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Kashmir Shaivism?\n\nKashmir Shaivism, he explained, is not one single, coherent philosophy. Rather, it is a family of philosophies—a broad, inclusive system that seeks to accommodate a vast spectrum of spiritual experiences.\n\n“What Kashmir Shaivism does is it takes the experiences of various spiritual practitioners and gives them importance, significance. People have various visions, various experiences of life, various deities, various kinds of samadhis—and you give all of those things a position in your worldview. Then you will get Kashmir Shaivism.”\n\nHe offered a powerful summary:\n\n> “My reading of Kashmir Shaivism is: it’s a philosophical framework for the phenomenology of spiritual experience.”\n\nIf you look across mystical traditions—within Hinduism, across world religions, and especially in the life of Sri Ramakrishna—you encounter not one type of mystical experience, but a whole spectrum. Kashmir Shaivism attempts to honor them all, to treat each as revealing some aspect of reality.\n\nThe result is a “capacious, very wide understanding of reality.” But that very breadth, the teacher suggested, comes at a cost.\n\n---\n\n## The Philosophical Trade-Off\n\n“It’s a kind of having the cake and eating it too,” he observed.\n\nWhile he expressed deep respect for the tradition—calling it “so nice and dear to me”—he also hinted at a philosophical incompatibility. “I don’t want to… use the knife on something which is so nice.”\n\nFor a spiritual practitioner, a sādhaka seeking enlightenment, Kashmir Shaivism offers immense value. It can help. It is effective. But when it comes to philosophy—to logic, consistency, and the core of ultimate truth—the teacher turned unequivocally to Advaita Vedanta.\n\n---\n\n## The Strengths of Advaita Vedanta\n\nHe highlighted two key strengths of Advaita:\n\n### 1. Directness and Simplicity\n\n“It’s straight. It’s direct and straight. It’s just one step or two steps. That’s it. Done.”\n\nAdvaita does not build elaborate metaphysical structures. It points directly to the non-dual nature of reality—to the recognition that ātman (the individual self) and Brahman (the ultimate reality) are one.\n\n### 2. Philosophical Rigor\n\n“For philosophical consistency, by sheer logic and rationality, Advaita is very tight. The arguments are very tightly connected.”\n\nThis makes Advaita uniquely defensible. “If you go to a philosopher of mind, or more so to a logician, to a skeptic—it’s very difficult to defend Kashmir Shaivism if people are attacking and arguing against you. It’s much more easier to defend Advaita.”\n\nHe described Advaita as “impregnable, indestructible.” Even a skeptic, he argued, would be hard-pressed to refute it entirely.\n\nTo illustrate, he pointed to Sam Harris, “one of the leading atheists in the world today,” who dismisses most religious claims as nonsense—yet acknowledges that Zen Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta contain “a core of truth” that cannot be easily dismissed.\n\n“That’s the power of Advaita,” the teacher said. “That’s why Vivekananda said it is the only religion for a rational world.”\n\n---\n\n## Can the Two Traditions Coexist?\n\nImportantly, the teacher did not reject Kashmir Shaivism outright. In fact, he affirmed that from an Advaitic perspective, one can “happily take advantage of all the wonderful things that Kashmir Shaivism has to offer.”\n\nHe acknowledged its “importance, significance, effectiveness,” and even noted that many of its concepts—such as Śiva’s līlā (divine play)—resonate deeply with Advaita.\n\n“We are Śiva,” he agreed. “Absolutely.”\n\nIn that sense, he sees Kashmir Shaivism as part of the broader Advaita tradition—a view supported by authors like Chandrahar Sharma, who includes it within the scope of his work on Advaita.\n\n---\n\n## A Final Word for Seekers\n\nFor the spiritual seeker, the teacher concluded, these philosophical distinctions may not be paramount.\n\n“For us, these technical differences don’t matter so much. We can note them and be happy with them… For philosophers, these differences are very important. But for us, it’s secondary.”\n\nHe encouraged students to have a “home tradition”—whether it be Kashmir Shaivism or Advaita Vedanta—and from that foundation, learn from other paths.\n\n“If your home tradition is Kashmir Shaivism, congratulations. Nothing like it. And you can benefit from the insights of all the other traditions also.”\n\nThis open yet grounded approach reflects the spirit of Sri Ramakrishna, who taught that all paths can lead to the divine—and that while we may walk one path, we can still be enriched by the others.\n\n---\n\nIn the end, the teacher’s choice was not a rejection, but a clarification—a preference for the razor-sharp logic of Advaita, even as he honored the expansive beauty of Kashmir Shaivism. For those drawn to clarity, consistency, and a path that stands firm under rational scrutiny, Advaita Vedanta remains, in his view, unsurpassed.",
