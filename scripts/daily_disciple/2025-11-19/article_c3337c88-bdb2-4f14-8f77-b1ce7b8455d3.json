      "string": "Sadhguru explains that a meditator is someone who has established an 'Ojas industry' within themselves. Ojas is a refined energy, built from life forces, that determines a person's presence and impact. Unlike the body, which can be a source of suffering, Ojas allows one to access a dimension of bliss that benefits everyone. However, modern lifestyles, mental instability, excessive sensuality, and lack of discipline can destroy Ojas. True spiritual growth requires making it a priority and creating a stable life, enabling one to become a source of well-being for all."

      "markdown_string": "# How Ojas and Meditation Can Transform Your Life\n\n## The Fundamental Aspect of Being Meditative\n\nAt its core, the state of being meditative—truly meditative—is about one fundamental process. It is not merely about sitting in silence for 15 minutes; it is about a profound internal transformation. The word \"meditation\" can be interpreted as the method of constructing what we call **ojas**.\n\nWhen we eat food, the process of digestion occurs. This digestion builds the physical body in a specific way. The food you consume is transformed into your physical form. While having a well-organized physical body is crucial for our material existence, the body alone does not fulfill any ultimate purpose.\n\nIn fact, if you have truly lived life, you know that the body can become a great instrument of suffering. Even as I say this, I am aware that the mind will interject: \"But the body is also a source of immense pleasure.\" Yes, the body is capable of experiencing pleasure. However, when we speak of meditation, we are looking at how to redirect the very life forces that use food and build the body toward constructing something far more subtle than the physical form.\n\nThe body is capable of enduring extreme pain and also experiencing great pleasure, but the limits of pleasure will, over time, become unsatisfying. It is often the *anticipation* of pleasure that drives people forward, not the pleasure itself. The waiting, the build-up, is frequently more thrilling than the actual attainment.\n\nTherefore, whatever little pleasure exists in the body, we embellish it in numerous ways. Societally, culturally, and psychologically, we make these simple bodily pleasures difficult to attain. Why? Because most of the excitement lies in the *longing* for them.\n\n## The Shift from Physical to Subtle: Generating Ojas\n\nMeditation is the process of transferring these life forces from building cells to a different level of creation. When the system begins to generate subtle energies—what we call **ojas**—then we say you are in a state of meditation. This is distinct from simply initiating people into a 15-minute void, which is self-contained in its own way but does not progress beyond a certain aspect of energy.\n\nIn terms of awareness, such practice is a wonderful tool. But in terms of energy, it has its limitations because the people being initiated are not prepared at any level for what lies beyond.\n\nWe are higher or more intense expressions of ojas. **Ojas** refers to the quality, intensity, and quantity of this energy that you carry. It is this that creates the difference between one human being and another.\n\nWhy does one person's presence feel so potent, while another's feels so weak, having no impact even on their own life? It is simply a matter of how much ojas you carry with you.\n\nA **meditative person** is one who has established an \"industry\" for ojas—a manufacturing unit for this subtle energy within themselves.\n\n## The Current State of Spiritual Practice\n\nPresently, the spiritual processes being taught to people are still regarded as a secondary concern. Spiritual practice has not yet become the supreme priority in people's lives. It is quite limiting and disheartening that people are not permitted to access the higher states of energy and ojas that a Guru can offer.\n\nIt is frustrating to see what is possible and not be able to facilitate it, either because people lack the necessary balance, preparation, or discipline, or because they are still unable to prioritize correctly among the various dimensions of their lives.\n\n## What Destroys Ojas?\n\nThere are many things you can do to destroy or dissipate the ojas developing within you:\n\n-   **Various types of mental activities** can do this.\n-   **Certain kinds of physical activities** can do this.\n-   **Excessive sensuality** can easily do this.\n-   **Over-indulgence in food** can do this.\n-   **Consuming too many stimulants** can lead to this.\n-   **Living in a polluted environment** can also cause this.\n\n## The True Purpose of Meditation: Beyond the Self\n\nThe aim is to engage in processes that enhance and transform the fundamental principles of a person's life, taking the individual into a completely different dimension of experience and bliss within themselves.\n\nThis bliss is not just their own; it will belong to everyone around them. **Your meditation is not just about you.**\n\nIf 25 people sitting in this hall were to become truly meditative—without even knowing why it was happening—the entire city would become calm, without anyone understanding what was occurring to them. A certain stability would permeate the atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, the more deeply a person goes into meditation, the more they become an instrument for the well-being of everyone.\n\n## The Prerequisite for True Well-being\n\nMerely speaking good words will not bring true peace and happiness. Real well-being will only occur when people carry the right kind of energy around them. It will only happen when the ojas is so abundant that 100 people can sit in your shadow and experience it.\n\nHere, and in many places I visit, there are many people who are experientially open. They are certainly capable of generating and sustaining higher possibilities of energy. They are capable. This is very clear.\n\n## The Modern Dilemma: Instability and Fragmentation\n\nHowever, this so-called modern education, the modern understanding of social life, and similar influences have made people utterly restless. They cannot stay with anything other than money and sex. People do not stay on track with anything. They cannot remain on a single path for more than three days.\n\nWhen they are in such a state of psychological instability, they keep changing, changing, changing, changing. Socially, it has almost become a norm that if you stick with something, the people around you say you are \"stuck.\" You are supposed to be changing all the time. It's a shift from this to that.\n\nWhether it's their job, their priorities, their education, or their relationships, people are constantly changing. In this flux, your energy also becomes unstable.\n\n## The Support Systems of the Past\n\nFor spiritual growth, Eastern societies created various forms of social support. In a way, these supports had nothing to do with spirituality per se. Yet, they were created for spiritual growth in such a way that when people wanted to follow the necessary circumstances, the circumstances did not work against their inner aspirations.\n\nThe circumstances were always aligned with what was happening within you. Socially, such systems were established to foster an environment conducive to inner development, ensuring that the external world supported, rather than hindered, the profound journey toward generating ojas and realizing one's highest potential through meditation.",
