      "string": "The video explains that achieving true samadhi, or a state of supreme consciousness, requires more than just intense meditation. It involves self-purification, cultivating virtues like humility and flexibility, and developing detachment from worldly desires. A wandering mind during meditation is common, and pushing harder only helps to a degree. True progress comes from a change in perspective and inner transformation, allowing one to rise above life's conflicts and adversities. By consistently practicing these principles, one can unlock deeper stages of bliss and a stable, peaceful mind, ultimately experiencing irreversible spiritual growth."

      "markdown_string": "# Cultivating Inner Stillness and True Samadhi\n\n## The Restless Mind and the Quest for Peace\n\nIf you’ve ever tried meditating—and I suppose most of you have, which is why you’re here—you’ve likely encountered a common refrain: “My mind is not stable.” You sit down to meditate, and before you know it, your thoughts wander off into realms unimaginable, unthought of, unheard of. Sometimes, you even experience thoughts that would never cross your mind in your normal, conscious state. \n\nWhen a meditator begins this journey, one of the first realizations is often, “Was my mind always this talkative?” You begin to notice the constant stream of thoughts—like the patter of rain outside—unceasing, unrelenting. \n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna tells Arjuna that two things are essential to steady the mind: **practice (abhyasa)** and, even more importantly, **detachment (vairagya)**. Living with a sense of detachment from the world around us is crucial. But why?\n\n## The Limits of Force in Meditation\n\nMany believe that if they push harder, concentrate more intensely, they will meditate better. But force only takes you so far. The subtle impressions of the subconscious continue to surface, disturbing your meditation and interfering with your state of consciousness. \n\nWe tend to take every thought that arises seriously, analyzing and engaging with it. But what we should be doing, especially during meditation, is **ignoring** these thoughts—not giving them power. \n\nBefore coming to the ashram, you might have worried: “I hope I get there. I’ve made a booking. I hope everything goes fine.” Now, you might worry about getting back home. The mind, when uncontrolled, is a source of constant disturbance. You can never fully trust its flow.\n\n## The Same Rain, A Different Experience\n\nI remember meditating in the Badrinath cave. Whenever it rained, I was overjoyed. Why? Because I knew no one would disturb me that day. Even with the cave door closed, people would sometimes knock, oblivious to my meditation. They had “the sensitivity of a three-year-old’s puppy.” You could shoot daggers with your eyes, and they wouldn’t understand. \n\nSo, the same rain that was an inconvenience for others became a source of joy for me. In India, finding a quiet place is sometimes harder than quieting the mind itself.\n\n## What Is True Samadhi?\n\nArjuna asks Krishna: “How do I attain that perfection of mind? How do I reach the state you call *sthita-prajna*—being firmly established in supreme consciousness?” \n\nWhat does it mean to be in **samadhi**? From my experience, samadhi has:\n- A **physical** dimension: profound sensations at the crown and brow chakras.\n- A **spiritual** dimension: a deep connection with the divine.\n- A **psychological and emotional** dimension: inner stability and clarity.\n\nBut how do you recognize such a person? How do they sit, talk, conduct themselves? There’s no tattoo on the forehead that says “samadhist.” \n\nKrishna explains that the one who has attained this state is **no longer attached to desires**. They have ceased to live only for themselves, relinquishing selfish karma in all aspects. This is not achieved by meditating harder and harder alone. It requires cultivating essential virtues.\n\n## The Illusion of Humility\n\nMany of you have tried to be humble, but it’s not easy. Deep down, almost everyone believes they are great. Even those who appear humble often carry a hidden sense of self-importance. \n\nI once shared a story about two priests and a janitor. The senior priest fell at the altar and cried, “Oh Lord, I am nobody!” The junior priest followed suit. The janitor, observing this, did the same. The senior priest then whispered to the junior, “Look who thinks he’s a nobody.”\n\nTry telling someone, “You’re not great. You’re just average. You don’t mean anything to the world.” Even if they claim to be a nobody, they might not truly feel it. \n\nHumility is essential for spiritual progress. But what is its opposite? Not arrogance, but **rigidity**.\n\n## The Bamboo and the Nature of Flexibility\n\nA guru once walked with his disciples through a valley. One disciple slipped and began falling into a gorge. The guru shouted, “Hold on to something!” The disciple grabbed a bamboo plant, which bent deeply but did not break. It allowed him to adjust, find his footing, and climb back to safety.\n\nThe master said, “That is what self-realization is.” The bamboo **bent but did not break**, and when released, it returned to its original state. This flexibility is the basis of all joy and humility. When you are flexible, you are not deeply attached. You can go with the flow, naturally becoming humble. There is no conflict. You can coexist with multiple truths.\n\n## Life’s Inevitable Challenges\n\nLife is not constant. You will face adversities, challenges, opposition, and criticism. Some will malign you; others will love you intensely. But Krishna advises: **Just because life isn’t going your way doesn’t mean you should become agitated.**\n\nIt helps to remember: **This too shall pass.** Worse times may come, so appreciate what you have now. Even in moments of great happiness, breathe—it won’t last. The sun will set, clouds will gather, and rain will fall. The key is to move beyond passion, attachment, fear, and anger.\n\nAnger can often be dissolved through flexibility—by saying, “Let’s agree to disagree,” or “Maybe there’s something to what you’re saying.”\n\n## The Story of Mulla Nasrudin and Perspective\n\nMulla Nasrudin was once riding his donkey backward—facing the tail. People stopped him and said, “Mulla, you’re riding wrong!” He replied, “Who says it’s wrong? My donkey wants to go this way, I want to go that way. We’re just having a disagreement.”\n\nAnother time, he and his donkey were both facing the right direction. The same people said, “Today, both of you are riding wrong!” Mulla replied, “Absolutely not. You all are standing wrong today.”\n\nEverything is a matter of **perspective**. In every conflict, there are at least two viewpoints. The more serious the conflict feels to you, the harder it is to let go of your perspective. But resolving a conflict doesn’t always bring peace—it may bring triumph or relief, but not necessarily inner stillness.\n\n## The Cracks in the Wall\n\nIf you want to stop water from seeping through a wall, you must plug **all** the cracks. If you seal one, the water will find another. Similarly, if you suppress one desire or conflict without addressing the root, it will manifest elsewhere.\n\nThe person whose consciousness has stabilized is a joy to interact with. They understand that today, people may sing their glories, and tomorrow, they may not. They recognize that others’ perceptions are fluid, changing with time and circumstance.\n\n## Walking Around the Cow Dung\n\nKrishna gives a profound analogy: If you’re walking down a road and encounter a patty of cow dung, what do you do? Do you stand there and yell at the government or the cow’s owner? Or do you simply walk around it? \n\nThe same applies to most undesirable things in life. Yet, we often let conflicts bother us—conflicts that have no real bearing on our lives. \n\n## Beyond External Renunciation\n\nKrishna says that merely giving up something externally is not enough. If you’ve renounced certain foods or pleasures but still crave them internally, you won’t find peace. Your senses will eventually overpower you.\n\nThe real challenge is to **distance yourself internally** from all that hinders your path. This is where true transformation begins.\n\n## The Power of Noble Company\n\nIn the presence of awakened beings, everything seems simple, beautiful, and meaningful. But when you’re away from them, the path feels difficult. \n\nKrishna Das once said about Neem Karoli Baba: “What amazed me most was not that Baba loved everybody—that’s expected of a saint. What amazed me was that **in his presence, I loved everybody**.” \n\nThat is the state we aspire to—a state where love and peace flow naturally.\n\n## The Journey of Consciousness\n\nAs you purify yourself and deepen your practice, you unlock new stages of bliss and new ways of seeing life. Your **viewpoint** changes. \n\nImagine you’re in a plane, taking off. As you ascend, the landscape changes every few seconds—each new aerial view represents a new stage of consciousness. At 30,000 feet, you see nothing but clouds. You may not even realize how fast you’re moving. \n\nSimilarly, as you progress spiritually, you rise above the clouds of mundane concerns. No matter how hard it’s raining below, from above, it’s just clouds. \n\nBut you can’t reach those heights on a bicycle. No matter how hard you pedal, you won’t fly. You need the right vehicle—the right practices, the right mindset, the right virtues.\n\n## The Simplicity of the Path\n\nUltimately, the path is simple:\n- Cultivate virtues.\n- Practice detachment.\n- Stabilize the mind.\n- Rise above attachments and aversions.\n\nWhen you do, your life transforms irreversibly. You experience a bliss that is more than adequate—a bliss that sustains you through all of life’s ups and downs.\n\nSo, keep moving. Keep cultivating. Keep unlocking new vistas of consciousness. And one day, you’ll find that wherever you look, you see the divine. \n\nAs Krishna says, “You’ll see me.”",
