      "string": "India's women's cricket team won their first ICC World Cup title on home ground, defeating South Africa by 52 runs. This victory followed a challenging tournament start and immense off-field adversity, including organized trolling and hate from their own countrymen. The video highlights inspiring personal stories of players from humble backgrounds—like Amanjot Kaur, whose carpenter father handmade her first bat, and Renuka Singh Thakur, who was supported by her uncle after losing her father. Despite financial struggles and social prejudice, these athletes triumphed through resilience and unity, proving that dedication and focus can overcome hatred and inspire a nation."

      "markdown_string": "# How India's Women Cricketers Overcame Adversity to Win World Cup\n\nAfter 47 years of waiting, a golden day arrived in our country's cricket history on November 2nd when our nation's women's cricket team won the ICC World Cup title for the first time - and that too on home ground at Navi Mumbai's DY Patil Stadium, where Harmanpreet Kaur's team defeated South Africa by 52 runs.\n\n## The Historic Final\n\n**ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 Final: India vs South Africa, November 2, 2025, DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai**\n\nSouth Africa won the toss and chose to bowl, thinking the grippy pitch would give them an advantage. India started strongly with 104 for no loss in 17 overs, with Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana making good use of the new ball. By the 40th over, India was 223 for three, making a 350 score seem possible.\n\nThen came South Africa's counterattack. Their star pacer Ayabonga Khaka, bowling for the second time, delivered stump-to-stump cutters and yorkers that resulted in Shafali, Rodrigues, and Richa Ghosh getting out. In the last 10 overs, only 75 runs were added to the scoreboard. The final total was respectable - 298 for seven, the second-highest total in a Women's World Cup final.\n\nBut South Africa was no pushover - this was their third final appearance, and their hunger was undeniable. Could India defend this score?\n\nSouth African openers Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits added 53 runs, but their partnership was broken by Amanjot Kaur's brilliant direct hit run-out. Then Shafali Verma took two wickets, and the game's momentum began to shift. Deepti Sharma then wreaked havoc on the South African batting order, taking 5/39 with yorkers, overspin, and variations that left South Africa bewildered.\n\nAfter Wolvaardt was out at 101, the task became easier. South Africa went from 211/6 to 246 all out in 45.3 overs. Harmanpreet Kaur's brilliant final catch sparked celebrations across the country. Our bowling squeeze was something South Africa would remember for months.\n\n## The Real Victory Beyond the Field\n\nThis victory wasn't just about what happened on the field. The way our players silenced their own countrymen who were spreading hatred against them is no less significant than the big win itself. In many ways, this historic victory feels like the real-life version of \"Chak De India.\"\n\nThese are players from India's most backward areas, fighting every difficulty, every circumstance. Coach Amol Muzumdar's story resembles Kabir Khan's, and ultimately, India's victory and the defeat of the nation's enemies. The BCCI has now announced a ₹51 crore prize for our women's cricket team and support staff.\n\nThese are cricketers whose families had to save every ₹51 to make ends meet - but this isn't about money, it's about victory, hope, unity, and the triumph of courage.\n\n## Stories of Struggle and Triumph\n\n### Amanjot Kaur: The Carpenter's Daughter\n\nMeet Amanjot Kaur's father, Bhupendra Singh, who couldn't hold back his tears after India's victory. A carpenter by profession, nothing could stop him from making his daughter a champion. When Amanjot was a little girl, she wasn't allowed to play cricket in the neighborhood because she didn't even have a bat. Bhupendra Singh then made a bat for his daughter with his own hands.\n\nThe neighbors used to mock, \"Look, a girl is playing cricket.\" But Bhupendra gave full support and didn't listen to anyone. For coaching, he would take Amanjot to the cricket ground at 5 AM, sleep in the nearby Gurudwara, then drop her home before leaving for his carpentry work. This routine repeated in the evening. Bhupendra never took work that was far from his daughter's training ground.\n\nToday, Amanjot is an all-rounder asset for Team India, a valuable player.\n\n### Kranti Gaur: Breaking Barriers from Tribal Background\n\nFor Kranti Gaur, there's no such case of men versus women comparison because she's the first cricketer from a scheduled tribes family. Whether man or woman, she's the first to represent the country from Chhatarpur District - a matter of great pride for the people there.\n\nKranti's village Ghuvara is a tribal majority village in rural Bundelkhand region. The nearest railway station, Timgarh, is 40 km away, with only one direct bus service from Chhatarpur. Kranti lived with her five siblings in a two-room police quarter. Her father was terminated from the police force in 2012 after differences with colleagues. Her mother had to pawn her jewelry, and her brother had to work as a bus ticketing booking agent to run the household.\n\nIn 2017, Kranti played her first leather ball match by chance when a local team needed a player. In that same first leather ball match, she took two wickets and scored 25 runs - pure talent. Today, Kranti's 6/52 against England in ODIs is a record by our women cricketers against England that remains unbroken.\n\n### Renuka Singh Thakur: From Tragedy to Triumph\n\nMeet Renuka Singh Thakur from village Parasa, 325 km from Dharamshala. Renuka's father Kahar Singh died when she was just 3 years old. Renuka's father was himself a cricket fan - he named his eldest son Vinod, inspired by Vinod Kambli. Uncle Bhupendra Singh Thakur recognized Renuka's talent while watching her play cricket with boys and sent her to Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association's Women's Residential Academy in Dharamshala. Renuka's mother stayed with her throughout this journey, supporting her. Today, the entire village, the entire country respects her.\n\n### Deepti Sharma: The Accidental Discovery\n\nDeepti Sharma's story is quite filmy. At her father's suggestion, her older brother took her to the next practice session at Ekalavya Sports Stadium in Agra. Deepti was sitting in the stands near the girls' playing area when a ball came towards her. She threw the ball back, and it went straight to hit the stumps. Hemlata Kala noted all this - Hemlata, former Indian batsman and current chairperson of BCCI women's selection panel.\n\nShe asked Sumit, \"Who is this young boy? Does he play cricket regularly?\" It turned out it wasn't a boy. In boy's cut, it was Deepti, who had never come to a cricket field before. Hemlata Kala said that same day, \"Let her play, she will represent India one day.\"\n\nDeepti's brother later quit his corporate job and devoted himself to his sister's training. Today, Deepti is a record holder for the highest score by an Indian when she scored 188 runs.\n\n## The Backlash and Bigotry\n\nDespite coming from different parts of the country, despite enduring so much social pressure, despite overcoming financial troubles, our women's cricket team faced trolling at a different level from \"chaddi-wearing IT cell\" and traitors while this whole World Cup was going on.\n\nWhen the team wasn't performing well, these trolls didn't offer criticism but straightaway resorted to insults: \"Cut the players' money and put it in Ladli Bahna Yojna, it will be better there.\" What a joke. When men's cricket doesn't perform well, perhaps Gabbar won't make such comments.\n\nThese trolls didn't hesitate for even two seconds to mock Jemimah Rodrigues' religion when she got out early in the finals. Think about it - our own country's star player couldn't perform well, and these people don't stop.\n\n## The Redemption\n\nAs our scriptures rightly say, truth and goodness ultimately win. Our women's cricket team has endured a lot - many taunts, much organized trolling. But the moment we defeated South Africa by 52 runs with that catch, all accounts were settled. Except for some digital terrorists, the entire country is celebrating today.\n\nAt DY Patil Stadium, former Indian men's cricket team captain Rohit Sharma also became emotional. Rohit knows what losing means - his team couldn't win the final against Australia in the 2023 World Cup final.\n\nIn fact, Jemimah Rodrigues revealed in a podcast that when her career was down, Rohit Sharma gave her advice that helped immensely: \"Brother, look, time can be very uncertain. Circumstances can be quite uncertain. But when opportunity comes, when the opportunity presents itself, our duty is to be fully prepared.\"\n\nJemimah confesses today, very honestly, that she cried during the entire tournament period - the pressure was so much - but she focused on cricket because she wasn't playing to prove anything to anyone, to disprove anyone - she was playing for the pure joy of the game.\n\n## The Coach's Redemption\n\nThis joy-filled story also belongs to the women's team's coach - Kabir, I mean Amol Muzumdar. He's said to be one of the greatest cricketers who never played for India. He scored 11,000 runs in domestic cricket, but in Team India at that time, the middle order had Dravid, Tendulkar, Laxman, and Ganguly playing. Unfortunately, he didn't get a place.\n\nIn 2014, he retired from first-class cricket. Eleven years after retirement, he gets the ODI World Cup as coach of India's women's team. This isn't just a win, brother. Women's cricket will never be viewed with that perspective in our country again. Now you'll see what kind of talent flood will come in the women's team too.\n\n## The Lesson for Everyone\n\n**Resilience. Grit.**\n\nBrother, if you do your right work, focus on your thing, maintain your passion, no matter how much abuse people hurl, redemption will come for you. Never let pressure ever get to you. Do what you want to do, do what is right. Do the hard thing, do the right thing, and you will be proven right one day.\n\nIt won't be easy - nobody said it would be. And if you look at the Indian women's cricket team, it has been a very difficult journey. But ultimately, truth and goodness win.\n\nAfter this, in my opinion, if anyone in our country has even a little shame in their eyes, they won't be able to tell any woman \"you can't do this\" because it has already been proven who can do what and who cannot do what.\n\nHere's to seeing many, many more women cricketers now rise and become role models in India.",
