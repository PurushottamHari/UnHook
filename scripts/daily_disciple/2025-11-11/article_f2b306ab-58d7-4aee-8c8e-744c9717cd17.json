      "markdown_string": "# PM Modi Vows Justice for Delhi Blast Attackers\n\nIn the wake of the devastating explosion that shook Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has issued a firm and resolute message: those responsible for the attack will be brought to justice. The blast, now confirmed as a deliberate act of aggression, has prompted a high-level investigation led by India’s premier investigative agency, the National Investigation Agency (NIA).\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Investigation Underway\n\nThe NIA is actively pursuing the case, with three more doctors recently detained from Al-Falah University as part of the ongoing probe. The agency is rigorously examining the evidence and circumstances surrounding the blast, which took place near the historic Red Fort—a deeply symbolic location in the heart of the capital.\n\nIn a statement delivered from Bhutan, Prime Minister Modi expressed his sorrow and solidarity with the victims and their families:\n\n> “I have come here with a heavy heart. The horrific incident in Delhi yesterday evening has pained everyone. I understand the grief of the affected families. Today, the entire nation stands with them.”\n\nThe Prime Minister also revealed that he remained in constant contact through the night with all agencies and key officials involved in the investigation. “Discussions were ongoing, pieces of information were being connected,” he stated, underscoring the government’s coordinated response.\n\nMost significantly, he declared in clear and unambiguous English:\n\n> **“All those responsible will be brought to justice.”**\n\nThis deliberate use of English highlights India’s intent to communicate its position firmly on the international stage—especially if foreign links to the attack emerge.\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ Strong Message from the Defence Minister\n\nEchoing the Prime Minister’s resolve, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also addressed the nation, extending his condolences and assuring citizens of a thorough and transparent investigation:\n\n> “I extend my heartfelt condolences to all those who lost their lives in the tragic incident that occurred in Delhi yesterday. I pray to God to grant strength and solace to the bereaved families in this hour of deep grief.”\n\nHe went on to affirm:\n\n> “From this platform, I wish to assure my citizens that the country’s leading investigative agencies are conducting a strict and thorough inquiry into the incident. The findings of the investigation will soon be made public. I want to formally assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice and will not be spared under any circumstances.”\n\nThe unified stance of both the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister signals a no-tolerance approach toward terrorism and a commitment to holding perpetrators accountable—whether they are executors on the ground or masterminds operating from afar.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Uncovering the Plot\n\nEarly investigations suggest that the attackers intended to cause far greater damage than what ultimately transpired. The explosives recovered and the scale of planning indicate that the blast could have resulted in significantly more casualties.\n\nWhile no group has yet claimed responsibility, security experts and media reports have pointed toward the possible involvement of the terrorist organization **Jaish-e-Mohammed**. The fact that the attackers struck at such a symbolic site—the Red Fort—sends a provocative message to the nation.\n\nAs of now, 13 people have been confirmed dead, with more than 25 injured. The emotional toll on the public, particularly in Delhi, is profound. Anger and frustration are palpable as citizens demand answers and accountability.\n\n---\n\n## 🌍 International Solidarity\n\nIn a moving display of solidarity, the people of Bhutan—where PM Modi was visiting—joined in prayer for the victims of the Delhi blast. The King of Bhutan led a gathering with the words:\n\n> “Let us all come together and pray for India.”\n\nSimilar messages of support have poured in from friendly nations, including Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister tweeted:\n\n> “I extend my and Israel’s deepest condolences to the people of India, especially to the families of the innocent victims killed in the blast at the heart of Delhi. Wishing speedy recovery to the wounded. Israel stands with India in its fight against terror.”\n\nThe United States, while yet to issue a specific statement on the incident, is expected to respond cautiously given its current diplomatic relations with Pakistan.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 A Note on National Resilience\n\nDespite the gravity of the situation, moments of unity and compassion—like the prayers in Bhutan and messages from global partners—remind us of the strength found in solidarity. As one observer noted:\n\n> “I often think how peaceful the world would be if there were more countries like Bhutan.”\n\nIn times of tragedy, such gestures reinforce the shared values of humanity and collective resilience.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ In Summary\n\n- A blast near Delhi’s Red Fort has been confirmed as a terror attack.\n- The NIA is leading the investigation; multiple detentions have been made.\n- PM Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh have vowed to bring all those responsible to justice.\n- International support has been expressed by countries including Bhutan and Israel.\n- The attack is seen as both symbolic and provocative, aimed at India’s sovereignty.\n\nThe government’s message is clear: India will not bow to terror, and those behind this attack will face the full force of justice.\n\n---\n*This is a developing story. Further updates will follow as the investigation progresses.*",
