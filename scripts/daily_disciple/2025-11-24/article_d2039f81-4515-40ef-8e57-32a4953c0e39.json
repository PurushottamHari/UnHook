The conflict began in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces, led by General al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by General Dagalo, over power and control of gold mines. The RSF has been accused of ethnic cleansing against non-Arab tribes in Darfur, with satellite images revealing mass graves. Foreign powers like the UAE, Iran, and Russia are allegedly supplying weapons, exacerbating the crisis. Despite peace talks, the war continues, pushing millions toward famine and disease, with inadequate international aid."

      "markdown_string": "# Sudan's Civil War and Humanitarian Crisis Explained\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Sudan is currently experiencing the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Thousands have been killed, millions have been displaced, and scenes of unimaginable horror continue to emerge.\n\nOn October 27, 2025, Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab released an analysis of satellite images from El Fasher, Sudan. What they revealed was terrifying: multiple piles of dead bodies surrounded by so much blood that the area appeared red from space. The report indicated that systematic ethnic cleansing of indigenous non-Arab tribes was occurring, with people being targeted in their homes.\n\n## Understanding Sudan's Strategic Position\n\nLocated in northeastern Africa just south of Egypt, Sudan borders Libya, Chad, and the Central African Republic to the west, while the Red Sea lies to its east—connecting it to Saudi Arabia and the broader Middle East.\n\nLike many Middle Eastern nations, approximately 95% of Sudan's population is Muslim, specifically Sunni Muslims. However, the country's divisions run along ethnic lines. Of Sudan's roughly 50 million people:\n- 70% are Arab Muslims\n- 30% belong to African tribes (Fur, Zaghawa, Berti, Muba)\n- Only 1-2% practice Christianity or traditional African religions\n\n## Resource Wealth and Poverty Paradox\n\nSudan possesses significant natural resources, ranking as Africa's third-largest gold producer with annual production exceeding 60,000 kilograms (compared to India's less than 2,000 kg). Despite this wealth, Sudan remains one of the world's poorest countries because approximately 90% of its gold is smuggled out illegally. This illicit trade deprives the government of revenue while funding armed groups' weapons purchases.\n\n## Historical Context: From Independence to Conflict\n\nAfter gaining independence from British-Egyptian rule in 1956, Sudan has largely been under military and authoritarian control. General Omar Hassan al-Bashir staged a coup against the civilian government in 1989, concentrating power and ruling for 30 years marked by economic crisis, corruption, inequality, and civil war.\n\nThe situation deteriorated so severely that in 2011, South Sudan seceded to become an independent country. The economy has remained in negative GDP growth for 17 years.\n\nIn 2019, widespread protests finally erupted against al-Bashir. However, this pro-democracy movement was hijacked by two military generals:\n- **General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan** (Sudanese Army)\n- **General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo** (leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces - RSF)\n\nTogether, they removed al-Bashir from power but established a caretaker government that maintained their control. In October 2021, al-Burhan dissolved this government and declared a state of emergency, consolidating power between the two generals.\n\n## The Descent into Civil War\n\nThe current conflict erupted on April 15, 2023, when tensions between the two generals boiled over. The primary dispute centered on the army's demand to integrate the RSF into the armed forces—a move Dagalo resisted as it would diminish his power. Both leaders also clashed over who would command the army during the proposed integration period.\n\nControl over gold mines further fueled the conflict, with both sides seeking to control these resources to fund their military campaigns.\n\n**Initial Phase:** The army had more resources including fighter jets, but the RSF had developed into a strong force. The RSF quickly captured the capital Khartoum and the presidential palace.\n\n**Recent Developments:** The army recaptured Khartoum in March 2025, but by June 2025, the RSF gained significant territory along the Libyan and Egyptian borders. As of early November 2025, the RSF controls most of western Sudan (Darfur and Kordofan regions), while the army holds the north and east. The country faces potential partition, with western Sudan likely to become a separate state.\n\n## Humanitarian Catastrophe\n\nThe human cost has been devastating:\n- **150,000+ deaths**\n- **10 million+ displaced**\n- Most hospitals and schools destroyed\n- Widespread famine conditions, with 375,000 people facing starvation in Darfur and Kordofan alone by September 2025\n- Diseases like cholera, dengue, and malaria spreading rapidly\n\nThe World Food Program warns that unless the war stops, Sudan could face the largest hunger crisis in recent history. More people are dying from starvation and disease than direct violence.\n\n## Resurgence of Ethnic Violence in Darfur\n\nThe conflict has revived historical ethnic tensions, particularly in Darfur. In 2003, non-Arab tribes protested against discrimination by the Arab-dominated government. In response, al-Bashir recruited Arab tribesmen to form the Janjaweed militia—Arabic for \"devils on horseback.\"\n\nThe Janjaweed committed brutal attacks against civilians, resulting in approximately 300,000 deaths and over 2 million displaced by 2008, primarily from Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa African ethnic tribes. The United States labeled this genocide, and al-Bashir became the first sitting head of state charged with crimes against humanity and genocide by the International Court of Justice.\n\nNotably, General Dagalo was involved in these atrocities, including a November 2004 attack on Adwa village where 126 people from the Fur tribe were killed.\n\nIn 2013, under international pressure, al-Bashir rebranded the Janjaweed as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and appointed Dagalo as its leader.\n\n## Current Ethnic Cleansing\n\nSince the civil war began in 2023, the RSF has resumed the same ethnic violence in Darfur. Despite the name change, the fighters' mentality remains that of the Janjaweed.\n\n**El Geneina:** Human Rights Watch reported in May 2024 that ethnic cleansing of the Masalit tribe was occurring, with at least 15,000 people killed between April and November 2023. HRW expressed concern that the scale of killings indicates the RSF intends to eliminate the Masalit community.\n\n**El Fasher:** The RSF captured El Fasher on October 26, 2025, after 18 months of fighting. Within three days, they killed over 1,500 people from non-Arab tribes (Fur, Zaghawa, Berti). The satellite images showing blood-red areas and mass graves referenced at the beginning correspond to these atrocities.\n\nThis violence has no religious dimension since nearly all involved are Sunni Muslims—it represents pure ethnic hatred. The RSF aims to convert Darfur into an Arab region by eliminating other ethnic communities.\n\nWhile the RSF denies involvement, their fighters upload videos showing them killing and celebrating among corpses. Meanwhile, the army also faces war crime allegations for airstrikes and heavy artillery in civilian areas.\n\n## International Involvement\n\nSudan's strategic location as a bridge between Africa and the Middle East, its position along major trade routes through the Red Sea, and its gold mines and oil pipelines have drawn international players into the conflict.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, both sides receive large-scale weapons from Russia, China, Turkey, and the UAE. Specific allegations include:\n- The UAE providing sophisticated Chinese drones to the RSF\n- Iran supplying missiles and drones to the army\n- Saudi Arabia and Egypt supporting the army\n- Russia's Wagner Group supplying missiles to the RSF\n\nThe Sudanese army filed a case against the UAE at the International Court of Justice in March 2025, but the court declined jurisdiction. The UAE denies involvement, while critics suggest it seeks to maintain control over Sudan's natural resources, particularly gold.\n\n## Prospects for Peace\n\nVarious peace talks have failed. Currently, the RSF has accepted a three-month humanitarian ceasefire proposed by the US, Egypt, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, but the army has yet to agree.\n\nThe proposed plan includes:\n1. Three-month humanitarian pause\n2. Permanent ceasefire\n3. Nine-month transition to civilian rule\n\n## International Response Failure\n\nThe international community has failed to adequately address the crisis. The UN reports that:\n- 30 million people (60% of population) need assistance\n- $4.2 billion required for 2025, but only $1.45 billion received\n- UNHCR needs $1.11 billion for refugees but has received only 35%\n\n## Conclusion: The Forgotten War\n\nSudan's tragedy stems from three power-hungry individuals: a former dictator and two military generals whose lust for power and wealth has devastated an entire country. Despite abundant natural resources, Sudan remains among the world's poorest nations.\n\nThis conflict has been called \"the forgotten war\" because most countries show little concern unless their interests are directly affected. History stands at the brink of another genocide in 2025, but with global attention and intervention, it might still be prevented.\n\nThe international community must recognize that what happens in Sudan doesn't stay in Sudan—the consequences will ripple through regional stability and global markets. The world has both a moral and practical imperative to act before another generation is lost to violence and hatred.",
