      "string": "A story illustrates how a couple's intense focus on their son led them away from spiritual life until his absence opened their hearts. The priest reveals their son was a blessing because his loss returned them to meaningful, selfless living. The message emphasizes that spiritual wealth, like material wealth, grows not by saving but by investing—sharing wisdom, resources, and faith. Just as Diwali symbolizes lighting an inner lamp, one must open their inner eyes to perceive goodness and align with universal wisdom, transforming struggle into purposeful effort."

      "markdown_string": "## How to Grow Spiritual Wealth by Sharing\n\nI once read a book—a short story, actually—by a Norwegian writer who won the Nobel Prize around 1903. His name was Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. No connection with Beyoncé, by the way. But he wrote this beautiful, moving story that has stayed with me.\n\nIt’s about a man who desperately wanted a child. That longing—the desire for an offspring—can be so powerful that it becomes almost impossible to overcome. People who can’t conceive often go from doctor to doctor, treatment to treatment, country to country, hoping to extend their own life through a child.\n\nThis man was no different. He tried everything. He went to his local church, to the priest, and pleaded, “Please pray for me. Tell me what I need to do to have a child.” The priest blessed him, and eventually, his wife conceived and gave birth to a son.\n\nWhen the child was born, the couple brought their baby to the priest. The priest looked at the child and said, “This son is going to be a great blessing to you.” The man and his wife were overjoyed. They took the blessing and went home.\n\nA few months later, they returned for the child’s baptism. The priest blessed him again. Time passed, and the child fell ill. They rushed back to the priest: “Please pray for our son. He’s sick.” The priest prayed, and the child recovered.\n\nMore time went by. They came again: “It’s his first day of school—please bless him.” The priest blessed him.\n\nAs the son grew, the parents became busier. Their focus shifted. They began saving for their son’s future—a natural thing, as any parent would do. But in doing so, they grew distant—from God, from dharma, from the deeper currents of life. What took precedence was their son—his needs, his upbringing, his future.\n\nHe graduated. They visited the church again. “Bless him—it’s his first job.” The priest blessed him.\n\nThen came his wedding. The same priest married the couple. The parents were delighted.\n\nBut then, a call came. The son was enlisted in the military. He went to the front—and was shot by the enemy.\n\nThe parents were distraught. Devastated.\n\nMore time passed. There were no grandchildren. They looked after their daughter-in-law for a while, but as they aged, she remarried and moved on.\n\nFinally, as an elderly couple, they returned to the church one last time. They told the priest, “We’ve written our will. We’d like to give everything to the church.”\n\nThe priest, now old himself, smiled gently and said, “Today, my words have come true.”\n\n“What words, Father?” the man asked.\n\n“Don’t you remember?” the priest replied. “I told you your son would be a great blessing to you. Today, he is a great blessing to you—because only in his absence have your hearts finally opened.”\n\nHe continued, “All the things you clung to throughout your life, forgetting what was absolutely fundamental to a meaningful existence… You became so enmeshed in your own desires, living from one day to the next, hoping to leave everything for your son. While commendable, it was meaningless—because it was steeped in selfishness. Only now, when you’ve taken this spiritual step, can I truly say: your son was indeed a great blessing.”\n\n---\n\n### The Trap of Holding On\n\nSometimes we ask ourselves: Why is this happening to me? How much do I really need to save? How much is enough?\n\nThe story reveals a profound truth: whatever nature has blessed you with—whether material resources, wisdom, love, or time—you must be willing to share it, to part with some of it. Otherwise, it will not grow.\n\nI was once asked: *What’s the worst financial advice you’ve ever received?*\n\nSomeone told me: “If you want to build wealth, learn to save.”\n\nThat’s wrong. You don’t become rich by saving. You become rich by **investing**.\n\nAnd the same is true for **spiritual wealth**.\n\nIf you hold tightly to whatever wisdom, knowledge, or resources you have—clutching them to your chest—they will not grow. They will decay. They will shrink, shrivel, and perish.\n\nWhatever you wish to grow—whether it’s love, compassion, understanding, or faith—you must be willing to part with it. You must learn to let it go, to trust in the hands of the universe.\n\n---\n\n### The Inner Light\n\nCultivating that faith—trusting in the wisdom of the universe, in the ways of the Divine—takes time. But once you are aligned with it, all *struggle* disappears from your life.\n\nHard work remains—and it should. Effort (*purushartha*) remains. But the suffering, the friction, the angst—that vanishes.\n\nThat is what dharma really is. That is, in a way, what **Diwali** is truly about: lighting that inner lamp of devotion, of bhakti, of wisdom and mindfulness in your heart.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nIf it’s dark outside, and you light a million lamps, but your eyes are closed—those lights are meaningless to you.\n\nBut if your eyes are open, you can perceive the light. You can see more clearly.\n\nIn the same way, when the **inner eye** is closed, we remain oblivious to all the good that surrounds us—in our lives, in our world.\n\nWe must open our eyes. We must learn to see the beauty that exists both inside and outside of us.\n\nMake one aspect more beautiful—the inner or the outer—and the other begins to reciprocate.\n\nWhen you share, you grow. When you give, you receive. When you open your hands, your heart opens too.\n\nAnd in that openness, spiritual wealth flourishes.\n\n---\n*Tags: wisdom, selflessness, Diwali, faith, purpose*  \n*Category: Spirituality*",
