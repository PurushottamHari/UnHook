      "string": "Acharya Prashant explains that people hurt others through words and gestures due to their own internal conflicts, expectations, and ego. He emphasizes that hurt arises from resistance, much like a wall hit by a bullet. To avoid being hurt, one should cultivate self-awareness, avoid hidden expectations in relationships, and communicate openly. By not clinging to identities or desires, one can remain unaffected, like the sky untouched by arrows. The talk encourages living with clarity and detachment to prevent emotional pain."

      "markdown_string": "### Why People Hurt Each Other and How to Avoid It\n\nIn a world filled with words, gestures, and unspoken expectations, one question echoes through our relationships and interactions: **Why do people hurt each other?** Whether it’s between teacher and student, husband and wife, senior and junior, or even strangers online—hurt seems to be an inevitable part of human connection. But is it truly unavoidable? And if not, how can we navigate life without inflicting—or receiving—so much pain?\n\n---\n\n## 🎭 The Nature of Hurt: Why We Harm One Another\n\nAt its core, hurt arises from **resistance**—the friction between what we expect and what we receive, between who we think we are and how the world treats us.\n\n> “Hurt means resistance. If you shoot a bullet at a wall, it leaves a hole. That hole is resistance. The wall tried to stop the bullet from passing through—so it got hurt.”\n\nWe hurt others—and get hurt—because we are attached to identities, desires, and expectations. The ego, like a rigid wall, wants to preserve itself. It resists change, criticism, and rejection. And in that resistance, pain is born.\n\n### The Two Sources of Hurt:\n\n1. **Unconscious Hurting**: Most of the time, we hurt others without even realizing it. Our actions, words, and gestures arise from our own unresolved inner turmoil.\n2. **Intentional Hurting**: Sometimes, we hurt others knowingly—driven by ego, desire, or the need to protect our self-image.\n\nBut in both cases, the root is the same: **we are not empty**. We are full of ourselves—our wants, our fears, our stories.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 The Illusion of “I Love You”: When Affection Becomes a Transaction\n\nOne of the most revealing examples of how we unknowingly hurt each other lies in our expressions of love and affection.\n\n> “When you say ‘I love you,’ you look deeply into the other person’s eyes—just like a hunter looks at its prey.”\n\nWe say “I love you,” but often, it’s not a gift—it’s a proposal. We are waiting for something in return: validation, attention, affection, or security. We refresh our messages, stay up all night waiting for a reply, and when it doesn’t come, we say, “I’m hurt.”\n\nBut were you really giving love? Or were you shooting an arrow, hoping to bring back a prize?\n\n### How to Respond When Someone Says “I Love You”:\n\n- **Ask clearly**: “What do you want?”\n- **Be honest**: If you can’t be selfless, at least be transparent.\n- **Avoid hidden expectations**: Unexpressed hopes are future wounds waiting to happen.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 The Wall vs. The Sky: Two Ways of Being\n\nImagine two objects: a **wall** and the **sky**.\n\n- The **wall** is solid, defined, and resists. When a bullet hits it, it gets a hole. It is hurt.\n- The **sky** is empty, open, and offers no resistance. A bullet passes through it without leaving a mark. It is unhurt.\n\nWe are hurt because we have become walls. We have built identities, desires, and attachments. We want to preserve ourselves. But the more solid we become, the more we can be broken.\n\n### How to Become Like the Sky:\n\n- **Practice emptiness**: Don’t let opinions, praise, or insults stick to you.\n- **Let go of self-image**: The more you define yourself, the more you can be hurt.\n- **Stop preserving the ego**: The ego is rigid. Consciousness is fluid.\n\n> “If you become like the sky, then even if someone shoots at you, there’s no one there to receive the hurt.”\n\n---\n\n## 💔 The Cycle of Hurt: How We Invite Pain\n\nWe often complain, “I’ve been hurt,” but we rarely ask: **Why did I make myself available to be hurt?**\n\n> “You say ‘I love you’ not as a gift, but as an investment. And when the returns don’t come, you cry.”\n\nWe accept respect, validation, and love from the world—and then we’re shocked when the same world insults us or takes them back. But why did we take them in the first place?\n\nWe feel incomplete, so we grasp at external things to fill the void. And the moment we take something, we become slaves to the giver.\n\n### The Trap of “I Need You”:\n\n- We seek love, respect, or validation to feel whole.\n- The giver now has power over us.\n- If we don’t meet their expectations, they withdraw what they gave—and we feel hurt.\n\nThe solution is not to stop receiving, but to **receive only from those who give selflessly**—or to enter into clear, honest transactions where expectations are stated upfront.\n\n---\n\n## 📜 A Practical Guide to Avoiding Hurt\n\n### 1. Be Clear About Your Expectations\nIf you have desires, express them openly. Don’t hide your hopes and then feel betrayed when they’re not met.\n\n> “Either have no expectations, or express them clearly. Don’t play hide and seek with your own heart.”\n\n### 2. Don’t Build Solid Identities\nThe more you define yourself—“I am respectable,” “I am successful,” “I am loved”—the more you can be hurt when those labels are challenged.\n\n### 3. Stop Taking Things Personally\nWhen someone insults you, ask: **Who is being insulted?** If there’s no solid “you,” then there’s no one to receive the insult.\n\n### 4. Embrace Detachment\nDetachment is not coldness—it’s freedom. It’s the ability to engage fully without being owned by the outcome.\n\n### 5. Don’t Get Attached to Praise or Blame\nIf you accept praise, you must also accept criticism. If you want the world’s respect, you must also be ready for its disrespect.\n\n> “If you accept one, you must accept the other. So why accept either?”\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 The Fear of Selflessness: “What If I Get Exploited?”\n\nA common fear arises: “If I become selfless, won’t people take advantage of me?”\n\nThis question itself is a trick of the ego—a way to avoid the responsibility of gratitude and openness.\n\n> “All assumptions are conspiracies. They are designed to protect the ego, not to discover the truth.”\n\nWe imagine future problems to avoid present transformation. But the truth is:\n\n- When you change, your world changes with you.\n- You won’t be the same person in a new situation—you’ll be the version of yourself that fits that reality.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 The Pendulum of Detachment\n\nMany worry: “If I detach, won’t I lose all motivation? How will I function in the world?”\n\nBut detachment is not indifference. It’s not a pendulum swinging between extremes—it’s the **center** from which the pendulum moves.\n\n> “You are still attached to the center. That’s why you return. Real detachment is not moving away from life—it’s engaging from a place of freedom.”\n\nYou can study, work, love, and live—without being owned by the results.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Final Words: The Art of Living Without Hurt\n\nHurt is not inevitable. It is the result of a false relationship with ourselves and the world.\n\nWe hurt because we are full.\nWe get hurt because we resist.\n\nThe way out is to become empty—like the sky.\nTo engage without grasping.\nTo love without demanding.\nTo live without preserving.\n\n> “Let there be nobody here to receive hurt.”\n\nWhen there’s no one to be hurt, there is no hurt.\nWhen there’s no one to be praised, there is no dependency.\nWhen there’s no one to be protected, there is no fear.\n\nThis is not a philosophy—it’s a way of being.\nAnd it begins with a single step: **stop building walls, and start becoming the sky.**\n\n---\n*Based on a dialogue on self-awareness, ego, and emotional healing.*  \n*Tags: #SelfAwareness #Relationships #Ego #Detachment #EmotionalHealing #Spirituality*",
