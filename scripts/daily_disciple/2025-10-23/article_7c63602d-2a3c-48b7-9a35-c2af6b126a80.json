      "string": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the 47th ASEAN Summit in Malaysia, leading to the cancellation of a planned meeting with former US President Donald Trump. Official reasons cited include domestic commitments related to Diwali celebrations and the upcoming Bihar elections. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent India physically, while PM Modi will participate virtually. The absence of a Modi-Trump meeting means unresolved issues like US tariffs on Indian goods and claims about India stopping Russian oil imports will remain unaddressed. Other global leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, are also skipping the summit, highlighting complex geopolitical dynamics."

      "markdown_string": "# PM Modi Skips ASEAN Summit, No Meeting with Trump Likely This Year\n\nIn a significant diplomatic development, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the 47th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, scheduled from October 26-28. This decision effectively cancels a highly anticipated meeting with former US President Donald Trump, which many had speculated could address several unresolved bilateral issues.\n\n## The ASEAN Summit Context\n\nThe ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit brings together leaders from 10 member countries—Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines—along with global partners. India has maintained a long-standing relationship with ASEAN since 1992, progressing from Sectoral Dialogue Partner to Full Dialogue Partnership in 1995, Summit-level participation in 2002, and finally a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2022.\n\nTraditionally, PM Modi has participated in these summits, making his absence this year particularly notable. Instead, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent India physically, while PM Modi is expected to join the ASEAN-India session virtually.\n\n## Official Reason: Domestic Commitments\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim confirmed Modi’s decision via a tweet, citing “domestic commitments” and a busy schedule. Two primary reasons have been highlighted:\n\n1. **Religious and Cultural Engagements** – The Diwali festive season is underway, and PM Modi traditionally engages in public celebrations and community events during this period.\n2. **Domestic Political Calendar** – Elections are approaching in Bihar, a politically significant state, and PM Modi is set to kick off his campaign there.\n\n## The Trump Factor: A Missed Opportunity?\n\nThe cancellation means a potential Modi-Trump meeting will not take place. Observers had been keenly watching for such an encounter, given Trump’s unpredictable diplomatic style and the unresolved issues between India and the US.\n\nKey topics that could have been discussed include:\n\n- **Trade and Tariffs** – Trump recently imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, leading to a notable decline in Indian exports to the US. Reports suggest a potential trade deal could reduce tariffs to around 15–16%, but nothing has been confirmed.\n- **Russian Oil Imports** – Trump has repeatedly claimed that India agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil by the end of the year—a significant statement given that Russia currently supplies 35–40% of India’s crude oil. Indian officials have not directly confirmed this.\n\nTrump’s recent remarks—including a claim that he and Modi spoke by phone during Diwali and that India would “stop its process [of buying Russian oil] by the end of the year”—have added to the diplomatic uncertainty. Modi’s office did not confirm these details, only acknowledging discussions on counter-terrorism and Diwali greetings.\n\n## Broader Geopolitical Implications\n\nOther world leaders, including Japan’s Prime Minister and Australia’s Prime Minister, will attend the ASEAN Summit. Notably, Chinese President Xi Jinping will also skip the physical summit—a move analysts suggest may be aimed at avoiding a direct confrontation with Trump amid ongoing tensions.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest was reportedly called off after Trump accused Putin of dishonesty regarding peace efforts in Ukraine. In response, the US imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWith Modi skipping the ASEAN Summit and Trump opting out of the upcoming G20 Summit in Africa, the two leaders are unlikely to meet in person this year. This raises questions about how—and when—critical bilateral issues will be addressed.\n\nIndia’s diplomatic presence will be maintained through EAM Jaishankar, and PM Modi’s virtual participation ensures continuity in India’s ASEAN policy. Nonetheless, the absence of a Modi-Trump dialogue leaves several strategic questions unanswered as the year draws to a close.\n\n---\n*This analysis is based on recent reports and official statements. Further updates may follow as the situation evolves.*",
